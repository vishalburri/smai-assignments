<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>

<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>

<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>

<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>

<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>

<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>

<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>

<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>

<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>

<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>

<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>

<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>

<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>

<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>

<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>

<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>

<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>

<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>

<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> by a division of labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of himself and many others <\s>
<s>    the united states have at the present time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile of settled area    by the side of the farm must early spring up a wide circle of industriesthe shoemaker the carpenter the blacksmith the wagon maker the painter the builder the mason and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small community from the earliest division of labor <\s>
<s> moreover    agriculture    is often used in a too limited sense as confined to producing food alone although even in that limited sense employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers <\s>
<s> in a new country the natural field of employment is found in the    extractive industries    which include the preparation for the market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately connected with them all the employments which transport these from one part of the country to another employing at present over one ninth of all our laborers ); and professional and personal services of an extended variety <\s>
<s> even therefore if we were obliged to forego manufactures entirely the    extractive industries    would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity of employments <\s>
<s> the real question however for most persons centers in the next stage of the industrial evolutionthat of the manufactures of these above mentioned products of the    extractive industries    it will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the oil sources may be more or less fertile or the ore deposits may be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other countries <\s>
<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>
<s> it all depends on whether the united states wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of carriage to this country into consideration <\s>
<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>
<s> this may be better seen by a simple diagram iron and coal england 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 iron and coal united states 4 3 2 1 wheat england 4 3 2 1 wheat united states 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1 2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4 5 6 7 of england <\s>
<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>
<s> but if the supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade although that is far inferior to the best grade in england <\s>
<s> likewise if the united states has three grades of wheat land superior to englands best grade the ability of england to grow wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 <\s>
<s> if we must resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as we <\s>
<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
<s> in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the protectionists he is referred to the following books careys    principles of social science    3 vols <\s>
<s> the form of argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>

<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> this being understood then as soon as the demand in the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing returns until a foreign countryhaving inferior agents of production as compared with our bestmay be able to send supplies into our markets <\s>

<s> even though foreign competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not be produced <\s>
<s> what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange between countries will not prevent the existence of various industries but only limit production to those grades of agents which are its best <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> so long as england can supply herself and the united states also with coal and iron from the three superior grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>

<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>

<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>

<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>

<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>

<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>

<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>

<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>

<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>

<s> in short under a system of free exchange as great a diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular industry are employed <\s>
<s> smaller amounts in some branches and greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade <\s>
<s> the most poorly endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not the whole industry itself <\s>
<s> no class of persons feel the competition of rivals more than english farmers since american wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow that england can not grow a bushel of wheat <\s>
<s> the fact is merely that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food <\s>
<s> so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would still keep that occupation in existence to    diversify    the others <\s>
<s> so far the explanation covers the    extractive industries    only or those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a larger quantity is demanded <\s>
<s> the real question arises as to the manufactures of these materials <\s>
<s> but we count upon larger industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than in england we must get more from an industry than england in order to satisfy us <\s>
<s> our grades of occupations therefore must be more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english grades in order to allow of their remaining free from competition <\s>
<s> but we have this superiority as regards our home market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the tariff ); 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the finished goods in reaching our markets <\s>
<s> now the processes of manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this country without fear of foreign competition <\s>
<s> and the range of this class of manufactures is surprisingly large <\s>
<s> it includes the manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of every day life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of wood such as all the furniture of common use <\s>
<s> the list is too long to be fully stated here <\s>
<s> these industries are not kept in existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction <\s>
<s> indeed if duties were removed from so called    raw materials    it is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than ever before <\s>
<s> and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce in free competition with england <\s>
<s> of course there are and it is to be hoped it will long continue so <\s>
<s> if there are not some kinds of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take nothing from us <\s>
<s> to deny this position is to say that the export and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more than 1,500 000,000 is of no profit and had best be entirely destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to a general diminution of wages and profits <\s>
<s>    on the ground that it lowers prices <\s>
<s> the argumentheard less frequently now than formerlyhas been advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger quantity is produced the advantages of large production are reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls lower here than it was before the duty was imposed <\s>
<s> the position is then held that protection does not raise prices <\s>
<s> it is of course understood to mean the prices of protected commoditiesa necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here than in england <\s>
<s> no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods <\s>
<s> that is the result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a progressive state of industry 372 the causes of this acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs existed or not <\s>
<s> it is the result of the general forward march of improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes <\s>
<s> to say that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy customs duties <\s>
<s> the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are seen working alike in tariff and non tariff countries <\s>
<s> but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise the prices of the protected goods in the home market <\s>
<s> the comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in this country for this would show only the general march of improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made between prices in this country to day and present prices in foreign countries <\s>
<s> does for instance the tariff increase the price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were removed <\s>
<s> the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to this <\s>
<s> if the duty does not raise the price then why does the woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties <\s>
<s> if goods can be sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists want any duties <\s>
<s> the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares <\s>
<s> the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics <\s>
<s> in 1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77 per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country <\s>
<s> this is to be seen in the following figures 373 which show in percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in england classes of articles <\s>
<s> groceries 16 provisions including meat 23 eggs butter and potatoes dry goods all grades 13 boots shoes and slippers 62 clothing 45 and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the massachusetts workmans expenditure represents more comfort and better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman <\s>
<s> if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in england <\s>
<s> in other words higher prices cut off the american laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received <\s>
