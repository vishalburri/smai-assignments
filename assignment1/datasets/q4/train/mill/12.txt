<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> it is of course open to discussion what form of society has the greatest power of dealing successfully with the pressure of population on subsistence and on this question there is much to be said for socialism but it has no just claim to be considered as the sole means of preventing the general and growing degradation of the mass of mankind through the peculiar tendency of poverty to produce over population <\s>
<s>    next it must be observed that socialists generally and even the most enlightened of them have a very imperfect and one sided notion of the operation of competition <\s>

<s> to meet this consideration socialists are reduced to affirm that when the richest competitor has got rid of all his rivals he commands the market and can demand any price he pleases <\s>
<s> but in the ordinary branches of industry no one rich competitor has it in his power to drive out all the smaller ones <\s>
<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>
<s>    another point on which there is much misapprehension on the part of socialists as well as of trades unionists and other partisans of labor against capital relates to the proportion in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it to enrich other persons <\s>
<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>
<s> the truth however is that he only obtains the   2,000 on condition of applying no part of the   20,000 to his own use <\s>
<s> he has the legal control over it and might squander it if he chose but if he did he would not have the   2,000 a year also <\s>

<s> the portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes to production nothing except the capital itself <\s>
<s>    the result of our review of the various difficulties of socialism has led us to the conclusion that the various schemes for managing the productive resources of the country by public instead of private agency have a case for a trial and some of them may eventually establish their claims to preference over the existing order of things but that they are at present workable only by the   lite of mankind and have yet to prove their power of training mankind at large to the state of improvement which they presuppose      6 <\s>
<s> property in land different from property in movables <\s>
<s> it is next to be considered what is included in the idea of private property and by what considerations the application of the principle should be bounded <\s>
<s> the institution of property when limited to its essential elements consists in the recognition in each person of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced by their own exertions or received either by gift or by fair agreement without force or fraud from those who produced it <\s>
<s> the foundation of the whole is the right of producers to what they themselves have produced <\s>
<s> nothing is implied in property but the right of each to his or her own faculties to what he can produce by them and to whatever he can get for them in a fair market together with his right to give this to any other person if he chooses and the right of that other to receive and enjoy it <\s>
<s> it follows therefore that although the right of bequest or gift after death forms part of the idea of private property the right of inheritance as distinguished from bequest does not <\s>
<s> that the property of persons who have made no disposition of it during their lifetime should pass first to their children and failing them to the nearest relations may be a proper arrangement or not but is no consequence of the principle of private property <\s>
<s> i see no reason why collateral inheritance should exist at all <\s>
<s> bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state <\s>
<s> the parent owes to society to endeavor to make the child a good and valuable member of it and owes to the children to provide so far as depends on him such education and such appliances and means as will enable them to start with a fair chance of achieving by their own exertions a successful life <\s>
<s> to this every child has a claim and i can not admit that as a child he has a claim to more <\s>
<s> the essential principle of property being to assure to all persons what they have produced by their labor and accumulated by their abstinence this principle can not apply to what is not the produce of labor the raw material of the earth <\s>
<s> if the land derived its productive power wholly from nature and not at all from industry or if there were any means of discriminating what is derived from each source it not only would not be necessary but it would be the height of injustice to let the gift of nature be engrossed by individuals <\s>
<s> but the use of the land in agriculture must indeed for the time being be of necessity exclusive the same person who has plowed and sown must be permitted to reap <\s>
<s> but though land is not the produce of industry most of its valuable qualities are so <\s>
<s> labor is not only requisite for using but almost equally so for fashioning the instrument <\s>
<s> considerable labor is often required at the commencement to clear the land for cultivation <\s>

<s> if he undertakes such improvements he must have a sufficient period before him in which to profit by them and he is in no way so sure of having always a sufficient period as when his tenure is perpetual <\s>
<s> these are the reasons which form the justification in an economical point of view of property in land <\s>
<s> it is seen that they are only valid in so far as the proprietor of land is its improver <\s>
<s> whenever in any country the proprietor generally speaking ceases to be the improver political economy has nothing to say in defense of landed property as there established <\s>

<s> no man made the land <\s>

<s> its appropriation is wholly a question of general expediency <\s>
<s> when private property in land is not expedient it is unjust <\s>
<s> the reverse is the case with property in movables and in all things the product of labor over these the owners power both of use and of exclusion should be absolute except where positive evil to others would result from it but in the case of land no exclusive right should be permitted in any individual which can not be shown to be productive of positive good <\s>
<s> to be allowed any exclusive right at all over a portion of the common inheritance while there are others who have no portion is already a privilege <\s>

<s> when land is not intended to be cultivated no good reason can in general be given for its being private property at all <\s>

<s>    next it must be observed that socialists generally and even the most enlightened of them have a very imperfect and one sided notion of the operation of competition <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> it follows therefore that although the right of bequest or gift after death forms part of the idea of private property the right of inheritance as distinguished from bequest does not <\s>

<s> bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>
<s>    another point on which there is much misapprehension on the part of socialists as well as of trades unionists and other partisans of labor against capital relates to the proportion in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it to enrich other persons <\s>
<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> it is of course open to discussion what form of society has the greatest power of dealing successfully with the pressure of population on subsistence and on this question there is much to be said for socialism but it has no just claim to be considered as the sole means of preventing the general and growing degradation of the mass of mankind through the peculiar tendency of poverty to produce over population <\s>
<s>    next it must be observed that socialists generally and even the most enlightened of them have a very imperfect and one sided notion of the operation of competition <\s>

<s> to meet this consideration socialists are reduced to affirm that when the richest competitor has got rid of all his rivals he commands the market and can demand any price he pleases <\s>
<s> but in the ordinary branches of industry no one rich competitor has it in his power to drive out all the smaller ones <\s>
<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>
<s>    another point on which there is much misapprehension on the part of socialists as well as of trades unionists and other partisans of labor against capital relates to the proportion in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it to enrich other persons <\s>
<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>
<s> the truth however is that he only obtains the   2,000 on condition of applying no part of the   20,000 to his own use <\s>
<s> he has the legal control over it and might squander it if he chose but if he did he would not have the   2,000 a year also <\s>

<s> the portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes to production nothing except the capital itself <\s>
<s>    the result of our review of the various difficulties of socialism has led us to the conclusion that the various schemes for managing the productive resources of the country by public instead of private agency have a case for a trial and some of them may eventually establish their claims to preference over the existing order of things but that they are at present workable only by the   lite of mankind and have yet to prove their power of training mankind at large to the state of improvement which they presuppose      6 <\s>
<s> property in land different from property in movables <\s>
<s> it is next to be considered what is included in the idea of private property and by what considerations the application of the principle should be bounded <\s>
<s> the institution of property when limited to its essential elements consists in the recognition in each person of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced by their own exertions or received either by gift or by fair agreement without force or fraud from those who produced it <\s>
<s> the foundation of the whole is the right of producers to what they themselves have produced <\s>
<s> nothing is implied in property but the right of each to his or her own faculties to what he can produce by them and to whatever he can get for them in a fair market together with his right to give this to any other person if he chooses and the right of that other to receive and enjoy it <\s>
<s> it follows therefore that although the right of bequest or gift after death forms part of the idea of private property the right of inheritance as distinguished from bequest does not <\s>
<s> that the property of persons who have made no disposition of it during their lifetime should pass first to their children and failing them to the nearest relations may be a proper arrangement or not but is no consequence of the principle of private property <\s>
<s> i see no reason why collateral inheritance should exist at all <\s>
<s> bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state <\s>
<s> the parent owes to society to endeavor to make the child a good and valuable member of it and owes to the children to provide so far as depends on him such education and such appliances and means as will enable them to start with a fair chance of achieving by their own exertions a successful life <\s>
<s> to this every child has a claim and i can not admit that as a child he has a claim to more <\s>
<s> the essential principle of property being to assure to all persons what they have produced by their labor and accumulated by their abstinence this principle can not apply to what is not the produce of labor the raw material of the earth <\s>
<s> if the land derived its productive power wholly from nature and not at all from industry or if there were any means of discriminating what is derived from each source it not only would not be necessary but it would be the height of injustice to let the gift of nature be engrossed by individuals <\s>
<s> but the use of the land in agriculture must indeed for the time being be of necessity exclusive the same person who has plowed and sown must be permitted to reap <\s>
<s> but though land is not the produce of industry most of its valuable qualities are so <\s>
<s> labor is not only requisite for using but almost equally so for fashioning the instrument <\s>
<s> considerable labor is often required at the commencement to clear the land for cultivation <\s>

<s> if he undertakes such improvements he must have a sufficient period before him in which to profit by them and he is in no way so sure of having always a sufficient period as when his tenure is perpetual <\s>
<s> these are the reasons which form the justification in an economical point of view of property in land <\s>
<s> it is seen that they are only valid in so far as the proprietor of land is its improver <\s>
<s> whenever in any country the proprietor generally speaking ceases to be the improver political economy has nothing to say in defense of landed property as there established <\s>

<s> no man made the land <\s>

<s> its appropriation is wholly a question of general expediency <\s>
<s> when private property in land is not expedient it is unjust <\s>
<s> the reverse is the case with property in movables and in all things the product of labor over these the owners power both of use and of exclusion should be absolute except where positive evil to others would result from it but in the case of land no exclusive right should be permitted in any individual which can not be shown to be productive of positive good <\s>
<s> to be allowed any exclusive right at all over a portion of the common inheritance while there are others who have no portion is already a privilege <\s>

<s> when land is not intended to be cultivated no good reason can in general be given for its being private property at all <\s>

<s>    next it must be observed that socialists generally and even the most enlightened of them have a very imperfect and one sided notion of the operation of competition <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> it follows therefore that although the right of bequest or gift after death forms part of the idea of private property the right of inheritance as distinguished from bequest does not <\s>

<s> bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>

<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state <\s>

<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>
<s>    another point on which there is much misapprehension on the part of socialists as well as of trades unionists and other partisans of labor against capital relates to the proportion in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it to enrich other persons <\s>
<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>

<s> competition however must be regarded in the present state of society as the principal regulator of wages and custom or individual character only as a modifying circumstance and that in a comparatively slight degree <\s>
<s> wages then depend mainly upon the demand and supply of labor or as it is often expressed on the proportion between population and capital <\s>
<s> by population is here meant the number only of the laboring class or rather of those who work for hire and by capital only circulating capital and not even the whole of that but the part which is expended in the direct purchase of labor <\s>
<s> to this however must be added all funds which without forming a part of capital are paid in exchange for labor such as the wages of soldiers domestic servants and all other unproductive laborers <\s>
<s> there is unfortunately no mode of expressing by one familiar term the aggregate of what may be called the wages fund of a country and as the wages of productive labor form nearly the whole of that fund it is usual to overlook the smaller and less important part and to say that wages depend on population and capital <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to employ this expression remembering however to consider it as elliptical and not as a literal statement of the entire truth <\s>
<s> with these limitations of the terms wages not only depend upon the relative amount of capital and population but can not under the rule of competition be affected by anything else <\s>
<s> wages meaning of course the general rate can not rise but by an increase of the aggregate funds employed in hiring laborers or a diminution in the number of the competitors for hire nor fall except either by a diminution of the funds devoted to paying labor or by an increase in the number of laborers to be paid <\s>
<s> illustration pie chart of fixed capital raw materials and wages fund this is the simple statement of the well known wages fund theory which has given rise to no little animated discussion <\s>

<s> the first attack on this explanation of the rate of wages came from what is now a very scarce pamphlet written by f <\s>
<s> longe entitled    a refutation of the wage fund theory of modern political economy    1866 <\s>
<s> however this may be experience shows that in the existing state of society the pressure of population on subsistence which is the principal cause of low wages though a great is not an increasing evil on the contrary the progress of all that is called civilization has a tendency to diminish it partly by the more rapid increase of the means of employing and maintaining labor partly by the increased facilities opened to labor for transporting itself to new countries and unoccupied fields of employment and partly by a general improvement in the intelligence and prudence of the population <\s>
<s> it is of course open to discussion what form of society has the greatest power of dealing successfully with the pressure of population on subsistence and on this question there is much to be said for socialism but it has no just claim to be considered as the sole means of preventing the general and growing degradation of the mass of mankind through the peculiar tendency of poverty to produce over population <\s>
<s>    next it must be observed that socialists generally and even the most enlightened of them have a very imperfect and one sided notion of the operation of competition <\s>
<s> they see half its effects and overlook the other half <\s>
<s> they forget that competition is a cause of high prices and values as well as of low that the buyers of labor and of commodities compete with one another as well as the sellers and that if it is competition which keeps the prices of labor and commodities as low as they are it is competition which keeps them from falling still lower <\s>
<s> to meet this consideration socialists are reduced to affirm that when the richest competitor has got rid of all his rivals he commands the market and can demand any price he pleases <\s>
<s> but in the ordinary branches of industry no one rich competitor has it in his power to drive out all the smaller ones <\s>
<s> some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboring classes and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry <\s>
<s>    another point on which there is much misapprehension on the part of socialists as well as of trades unionists and other partisans of labor against capital relates to the proportion in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it to enrich other persons <\s>
<s> when for instance a capitalist invests   20,000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose   2,000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the   20,000 and of the   2,000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages <\s>
<s> the truth however is that he only obtains the   2,000 on condition of applying no part of the   20,000 to his own use <\s>
<s> he has the legal control over it and might squander it if he chose but if he did he would not have the   2,000 a year also <\s>
<s> for all personal purposes they have the capital and he has but the profits which it only yields to him on condition that the capital itself is employed in satisfying not his own wants but those of laborers <\s>
<s> even of his own share a small part only belongs to him as the owner of capital <\s>
<s> the portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes to production nothing except the capital itself <\s>
<s>    the result of our review of the various difficulties of socialism has led us to the conclusion that the various schemes for managing the productive resources of the country by public instead of private agency have a case for a trial and some of them may eventually establish their claims to preference over the existing order of things but that they are at present workable only by the   lite of mankind and have yet to prove their power of training mankind at large to the state of improvement which they presuppose      6 <\s>
<s> property in land different from property in movables <\s>
<s> it is next to be considered what is included in the idea of private property and by what considerations the application of the principle should be bounded <\s>
<s> the institution of property when limited to its essential elements consists in the recognition in each person of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced by their own exertions or received either by gift or by fair agreement without force or fraud from those who produced it <\s>
<s> the foundation of the whole is the right of producers to what they themselves have produced <\s>
<s> nothing is implied in property but the right of each to his or her own faculties to what he can produce by them and to whatever he can get for them in a fair market together with his right to give this to any other person if he chooses and the right of that other to receive and enjoy it <\s>
<s> it follows therefore that although the right of bequest or gift after death forms part of the idea of private property the right of inheritance as distinguished from bequest does not <\s>
<s> that the property of persons who have made no disposition of it during their lifetime should pass first to their children and failing them to the nearest relations may be a proper arrangement or not but is no consequence of the principle of private property <\s>
<s> i see no reason why collateral inheritance should exist at all <\s>
