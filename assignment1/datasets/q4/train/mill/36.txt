<s> characteristic features of industrial progress <\s>
<s> continuing the inquiry into the nature of the economical changes taking place in a society which is in a state of industrial progress we shall next consider what is the effect of that progress on the distribution of the produce among the various classes who share in it <\s>
<s> we may confine our attention to the system of distribution which is the most complex and which virtually includes all othersthat in which the produce of manufactures is shared between two classes laborers and capitalists and the produce of agriculture among three laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> the characteristic features of what is commonly meant by industrial progress resolve themselves mainly into three increase of capital increase of population and improvements in production understanding the last expression in its widest sense to include the process of procuring commodities from a distance as well as that of producing them <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to set out by considering each of the three causes as operating separately after which we can suppose them combined in any manner we think fit 298   2 <\s>
<s> first two cases population and capital increasing the arts of production stationary <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness we will form two general groups of these causes a <\s>
<s> the influence of population and capital improvements remaining stationary <\s>
<s> the influence of improvements population and capital remaining stationary <\s>
<s> we will first take up a and under this division make for convenience two separate suppositions i <\s>
<s> the first is that while population is advancing capital is stationary <\s>
<s> by this means we can study separately the operation of one of the factors of societary progress population and see its influence on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> there being only the same given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains more produce 2 profits rise <\s>
<s> now if the laborers were so well off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required from the soil <\s>
<s> this supply can be produced only at a greater cost and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will rise <\s>
<s> this last action 3 however will have an influence on the rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> for it was only by a reduction of real wages that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had not risen <\s>
<s> the result of this first supposition then is that the landlord is the chief gainer i <\s>
<s> 2 profits rise less if rents rise <\s>
<s> we will now take up the second supposition under a that while capital is advancing population remains stationary <\s>
<s> then of course 1 wages will rise and as there is no improvement to cheapen the cost of their real wages there will be an increase in cost of labor to the capitalist and 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> if now the laborers being better off demand more food the new food would cost more as the margin of cultivation was pushed down and 3 rents would inevitably rise <\s>
<s> but not only have the laborers received more real wages but since that change the cost as just described of these real wages has increased <\s>
<s> therefore 2 profits would fall still more than by the rise of real wages <\s>
<s> in this supposition consequently while the laborer gains so does the landlord ii <\s>
<s> 2 profits fall more if rents rise <\s>
<s> it is easy for us now to take into our view the total effects under a and see what the combined action of i and ii would be <\s>
<s> that is if both capital and population improvements remaining stationary increase what will be the effect on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> of course we must suppose that capital and population just keep pace with each other and in that case 1 real wages remain the same each laborer receiving the same quantity and same quality of commodities as before <\s>
<s> hence if each laborer receives the same quantity as before and there are many more laborers there will be an increased demand put upon the soil for food poorer soils will be cultivated and the cost of the products will rise <\s>
<s> so 3 rents rise <\s>
<s> but if each laborer receives the same quantity of real wages as before and the cost of them has risen as just explained an increased cost of labor will result which must come out of profits <\s>
<s> 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> so that the results of a upon distribution taken separately from b are that the owner of capital loses but the owner of land again gains <\s>
<s> 1 wages the same <\s>
<s> the arts of production advancing capital and population stationary <\s>
<s> now let us go back to our first general group of causes ban advance in the arts of production while capital and population remain stationary <\s>
<s> we can now study by themselves the effect of improvements on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> the general effects arising from the extended introduction of machinery into agriculture and manufactures the lowered cost of transportation by steam have been to lessen the value of articles consumed chiefly by the laboring classes <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness imagine that the improvement comes suddenly <\s>
<s> the first effect will be to lower the value and price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborers and if those consist mostly of food there will be a rise in the margin of cultivation and a fall in rents 3 <\s>
<s> it has been previously shown 299 that improvements retard or put back the law of diminishing returns from land or in manufactures compensate for it and so lower rents <\s>
<s> the poorest soil cultivated is now of a better grade than before and the produce is yielded at a less cost and value so that the land with which the best grades are compared to determine the rent is not separated from the best grades by so wide a gap <\s>
<s> it would at first blush seem then that the interests of the landlord were antagonistic to improvements since they lower rents but in practice it is not so as we shall soon see <\s>
<s> we have seen that improvements cheapen the price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborer <\s>
<s> having had a given sum as money wages before the change then when the sudden change of improvements came it lowered prices to the laborer and the same money wages bought more 1 real wages <\s>
<s> if nothing more happened we could see that improvements raised real wageswithout lowering 2 profits because cost of labor remains the same since the lowered cost of the articles consumed was exactly in proportion to the increase of real wages <\s>
<s> and if the laborers chose to retain this higher standard this would be the situation <\s>
<s> sadly enough however in practice they are apt to be satisfied with the old standard and the amount of real wages to give the old standard of living can be had now for less money wages <\s>
<s> while only the same number without any increase can live at the new higher standard a larger number can live at the old lower standard <\s>
<s> in short the obstacles to an increase of population will be removed by the possession of higher money wages <\s>
<s> after a generation it is very probable that a larger number of laborers will be in existence living at the same or possibly a slightly higher standard of real wages and money wages will have fallen <\s>
<s> new methods of getting food supplies from foreign countries act equally with improvements at home <\s>

<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> characteristic features of industrial progress <\s>
<s> continuing the inquiry into the nature of the economical changes taking place in a society which is in a state of industrial progress we shall next consider what is the effect of that progress on the distribution of the produce among the various classes who share in it <\s>
<s> we may confine our attention to the system of distribution which is the most complex and which virtually includes all othersthat in which the produce of manufactures is shared between two classes laborers and capitalists and the produce of agriculture among three laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> the characteristic features of what is commonly meant by industrial progress resolve themselves mainly into three increase of capital increase of population and improvements in production understanding the last expression in its widest sense to include the process of procuring commodities from a distance as well as that of producing them <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to set out by considering each of the three causes as operating separately after which we can suppose them combined in any manner we think fit 298   2 <\s>
<s> first two cases population and capital increasing the arts of production stationary <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness we will form two general groups of these causes a <\s>
<s> the influence of population and capital improvements remaining stationary <\s>
<s> the influence of improvements population and capital remaining stationary <\s>
<s> we will first take up a and under this division make for convenience two separate suppositions i <\s>
<s> the first is that while population is advancing capital is stationary <\s>
<s> by this means we can study separately the operation of one of the factors of societary progress population and see its influence on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> there being only the same given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains more produce 2 profits rise <\s>
<s> now if the laborers were so well off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required from the soil <\s>
<s> this supply can be produced only at a greater cost and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will rise <\s>
<s> this last action 3 however will have an influence on the rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> for it was only by a reduction of real wages that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had not risen <\s>
<s> the result of this first supposition then is that the landlord is the chief gainer i <\s>
<s> 2 profits rise less if rents rise <\s>
<s> we will now take up the second supposition under a that while capital is advancing population remains stationary <\s>
<s> then of course 1 wages will rise and as there is no improvement to cheapen the cost of their real wages there will be an increase in cost of labor to the capitalist and 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> if now the laborers being better off demand more food the new food would cost more as the margin of cultivation was pushed down and 3 rents would inevitably rise <\s>
<s> but not only have the laborers received more real wages but since that change the cost as just described of these real wages has increased <\s>
<s> therefore 2 profits would fall still more than by the rise of real wages <\s>
<s> in this supposition consequently while the laborer gains so does the landlord ii <\s>
<s> 2 profits fall more if rents rise <\s>
<s> it is easy for us now to take into our view the total effects under a and see what the combined action of i and ii would be <\s>
<s> that is if both capital and population improvements remaining stationary increase what will be the effect on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> of course we must suppose that capital and population just keep pace with each other and in that case 1 real wages remain the same each laborer receiving the same quantity and same quality of commodities as before <\s>
<s> hence if each laborer receives the same quantity as before and there are many more laborers there will be an increased demand put upon the soil for food poorer soils will be cultivated and the cost of the products will rise <\s>
<s> so 3 rents rise <\s>
<s> but if each laborer receives the same quantity of real wages as before and the cost of them has risen as just explained an increased cost of labor will result which must come out of profits <\s>
<s> 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> so that the results of a upon distribution taken separately from b are that the owner of capital loses but the owner of land again gains <\s>
<s> 1 wages the same <\s>
<s> the arts of production advancing capital and population stationary <\s>
<s> now let us go back to our first general group of causes ban advance in the arts of production while capital and population remain stationary <\s>
<s> we can now study by themselves the effect of improvements on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> the general effects arising from the extended introduction of machinery into agriculture and manufactures the lowered cost of transportation by steam have been to lessen the value of articles consumed chiefly by the laboring classes <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness imagine that the improvement comes suddenly <\s>
<s> the first effect will be to lower the value and price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborers and if those consist mostly of food there will be a rise in the margin of cultivation and a fall in rents 3 <\s>
<s> it has been previously shown 299 that improvements retard or put back the law of diminishing returns from land or in manufactures compensate for it and so lower rents <\s>
<s> the poorest soil cultivated is now of a better grade than before and the produce is yielded at a less cost and value so that the land with which the best grades are compared to determine the rent is not separated from the best grades by so wide a gap <\s>
<s> it would at first blush seem then that the interests of the landlord were antagonistic to improvements since they lower rents but in practice it is not so as we shall soon see <\s>
<s> we have seen that improvements cheapen the price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborer <\s>
<s> having had a given sum as money wages before the change then when the sudden change of improvements came it lowered prices to the laborer and the same money wages bought more 1 real wages <\s>
<s> if nothing more happened we could see that improvements raised real wageswithout lowering 2 profits because cost of labor remains the same since the lowered cost of the articles consumed was exactly in proportion to the increase of real wages <\s>
<s> and if the laborers chose to retain this higher standard this would be the situation <\s>
<s> sadly enough however in practice they are apt to be satisfied with the old standard and the amount of real wages to give the old standard of living can be had now for less money wages <\s>
<s> while only the same number without any increase can live at the new higher standard a larger number can live at the old lower standard <\s>
<s> in short the obstacles to an increase of population will be removed by the possession of higher money wages <\s>
<s> after a generation it is very probable that a larger number of laborers will be in existence living at the same or possibly a slightly higher standard of real wages and money wages will have fallen <\s>
<s> new methods of getting food supplies from foreign countries act equally with improvements at home <\s>
<s> effect of the progress of society in moderating fluctuations of value <\s>
<s> thus far of the effect of the progress of society on the permanent or average values and prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it remains to be considered in what manner the same progress affects their fluctuations <\s>
<s> concerning the answer to this question there can be no doubt <\s>
<s> it tends in a very high degree to diminish them <\s>
<s> in poor and backward societies as in the east and in europe during the middle ages extraordinary differences in the price of the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other because the want of roads and canals the imperfection of marine navigation and the insecurity of communications generally prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear <\s>
<s> the things most liable to fluctuations in value those directly influenced by the seasons and especially food were seldom carried to any great distances <\s>
<s> in most years accordingly there was in some part or other of any large country a real dearth while a deficiency at all considerable extending to the whole world is now a thing almost unknown <\s>
<s> in modern times therefore there is only dearth where there formerly would have been famine and sufficiency everywhere when anciently there would have been scarcity in some places and superfluity in others <\s>
<s> the same change has taken place with respect to all other articles of commerce <\s>
<s> the safety and cheapness of communications which enable a deficiency in one place to be supplied from the surplus of another at a moderate or even a small advance on the ordinary price render the fluctuations of prices much less extreme than formerly <\s>
<s> this effect is much promoted by the existence of large capitals belonging to what are called speculative merchants whose business it is to buy goods in order to resell them at a profit <\s>
<s> these dealers naturally buying things when they are cheapest and storing them up to be brought again into the market when the price has become unusually high the tendency of their operations is to equalize price or at least to moderate its inequalities <\s>
<s> the prices of things are neither so much depressed at one time nor so much raised at another as they would be if speculative dealers did not exist <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    speculative    in a different sense from that which is customary in this country <\s>
<s> merchants who buy outright and store up grain are not speculators in the sense in which the word is used with us but those gamblers who purchase    for future delivery    grain which they never see and which they sell in the same way are here known as speculators <\s>
<s> it appears then that the fluctuations of values and prices arising from variations of supply or from alterations in real as distinguished from speculative demand may be expected to become more moderate as society advances <\s>
<s> with regard to those which arise from miscalculation and especially from the alternations of undue expansion and excessive contraction of credit which occupy so conspicuous a place among commercial phenomena the same thing can not be affirmed with equal confidence <\s>
<s> such vicissitudes beginning with irrational speculation and ending with a commercial crisis have not hitherto become either less frequent or less violent with the growth of capital and extension of industry <\s>
<s> rather they may be said to have become more so in consequence as is often said of increased competition but as i prefer to say of a lower rate of profits and interest which makes capitalists dissatisfied with the ordinary course of safe mercantile gains <\s>
<s> the connection of this low rate of profit with the advance of population and accumulation is one of the points to be illustrated in the ensuing chapters <\s>
<s> cairnes also adds some investigations as to the fluctuations of value    hitherto i have examined the derivative laws of value in so far only as they are exemplified in the movements of normal prices <\s>
<s> it will be interesting now to consider whether it is possible to discover in the movements of market prices any corresponding phenomena <\s>
<s>    taking manufactures first it is evident at once that as regards conditions of protection the circumstances of the case are such as to secure in general 1 great rapidity and great certainty in bringing commodities to market <\s>
<s> a deal table may be made in a few hours a piece of cloth in a few weeks and a moderate sized house in a month or little more <\s>
<s> tables cloth and houses may be produced with certainty in any quantity required <\s>
<s> it results from this that it is scarcely possible that under ordinary circumstances the selling price of a product of manufacture should for any long time much exceed its normal price <\s>
<s> 2 the nature of manufactures is in general such as to fit them admirably for distant transport <\s>
<s> any considerable elevation of price therefore is pretty certain to attract supplies from remote sources <\s>
<s> 3 further considered in their relation to human needs i think it may be said of manufactured goods that either the need for them is not very urgent or where it happens to be so substitutes ... <\s>

<s> in poor and backward societies as in the east and in europe during the middle ages extraordinary differences in the price of the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other because the want of roads and canals the imperfection of marine navigation and the insecurity of communications generally prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear <\s>

<s> the influence of improvements population and capital remaining stationary <\s>
<s> we will first take up a and under this division make for convenience two separate suppositions i <\s>
<s> the first is that while population is advancing capital is stationary <\s>
<s> by this means we can study separately the operation of one of the factors of societary progress population and see its influence on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> there being only the same given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains more produce 2 profits rise <\s>
<s> now if the laborers were so well off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required from the soil <\s>
<s> this supply can be produced only at a greater cost and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will rise <\s>
<s> this last action 3 however will have an influence on the rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> for it was only by a reduction of real wages that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had not risen <\s>
<s> the result of this first supposition then is that the landlord is the chief gainer i <\s>
<s> 2 profits rise less if rents rise <\s>

<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> characteristic features of industrial progress <\s>
<s> continuing the inquiry into the nature of the economical changes taking place in a society which is in a state of industrial progress we shall next consider what is the effect of that progress on the distribution of the produce among the various classes who share in it <\s>
<s> we may confine our attention to the system of distribution which is the most complex and which virtually includes all othersthat in which the produce of manufactures is shared between two classes laborers and capitalists and the produce of agriculture among three laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> the characteristic features of what is commonly meant by industrial progress resolve themselves mainly into three increase of capital increase of population and improvements in production understanding the last expression in its widest sense to include the process of procuring commodities from a distance as well as that of producing them <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to set out by considering each of the three causes as operating separately after which we can suppose them combined in any manner we think fit 298   2 <\s>
<s> first two cases population and capital increasing the arts of production stationary <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness we will form two general groups of these causes a <\s>
<s> the influence of population and capital improvements remaining stationary <\s>
<s> the influence of improvements population and capital remaining stationary <\s>
<s> we will first take up a and under this division make for convenience two separate suppositions i <\s>
<s> the first is that while population is advancing capital is stationary <\s>
<s> by this means we can study separately the operation of one of the factors of societary progress population and see its influence on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> there being only the same given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains more produce 2 profits rise <\s>
<s> now if the laborers were so well off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required from the soil <\s>
<s> this supply can be produced only at a greater cost and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will rise <\s>
<s> this last action 3 however will have an influence on the rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> for it was only by a reduction of real wages that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had not risen <\s>
<s> the result of this first supposition then is that the landlord is the chief gainer i <\s>
<s> 2 profits rise less if rents rise <\s>
<s> we will now take up the second supposition under a that while capital is advancing population remains stationary <\s>
<s> then of course 1 wages will rise and as there is no improvement to cheapen the cost of their real wages there will be an increase in cost of labor to the capitalist and 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> if now the laborers being better off demand more food the new food would cost more as the margin of cultivation was pushed down and 3 rents would inevitably rise <\s>
<s> but not only have the laborers received more real wages but since that change the cost as just described of these real wages has increased <\s>
<s> therefore 2 profits would fall still more than by the rise of real wages <\s>
<s> in this supposition consequently while the laborer gains so does the landlord ii <\s>
<s> 2 profits fall more if rents rise <\s>
<s> it is easy for us now to take into our view the total effects under a and see what the combined action of i and ii would be <\s>
<s> that is if both capital and population improvements remaining stationary increase what will be the effect on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> of course we must suppose that capital and population just keep pace with each other and in that case 1 real wages remain the same each laborer receiving the same quantity and same quality of commodities as before <\s>
<s> hence if each laborer receives the same quantity as before and there are many more laborers there will be an increased demand put upon the soil for food poorer soils will be cultivated and the cost of the products will rise <\s>
<s> so 3 rents rise <\s>
<s> but if each laborer receives the same quantity of real wages as before and the cost of them has risen as just explained an increased cost of labor will result which must come out of profits <\s>
<s> 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> so that the results of a upon distribution taken separately from b are that the owner of capital loses but the owner of land again gains <\s>
<s> 1 wages the same <\s>
<s> the arts of production advancing capital and population stationary <\s>
<s> now let us go back to our first general group of causes ban advance in the arts of production while capital and population remain stationary <\s>
<s> we can now study by themselves the effect of improvements on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> the general effects arising from the extended introduction of machinery into agriculture and manufactures the lowered cost of transportation by steam have been to lessen the value of articles consumed chiefly by the laboring classes <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness imagine that the improvement comes suddenly <\s>
<s> the first effect will be to lower the value and price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborers and if those consist mostly of food there will be a rise in the margin of cultivation and a fall in rents 3 <\s>
<s> it has been previously shown 299 that improvements retard or put back the law of diminishing returns from land or in manufactures compensate for it and so lower rents <\s>
<s> the poorest soil cultivated is now of a better grade than before and the produce is yielded at a less cost and value so that the land with which the best grades are compared to determine the rent is not separated from the best grades by so wide a gap <\s>
<s> it would at first blush seem then that the interests of the landlord were antagonistic to improvements since they lower rents but in practice it is not so as we shall soon see <\s>
<s> we have seen that improvements cheapen the price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborer <\s>
<s> having had a given sum as money wages before the change then when the sudden change of improvements came it lowered prices to the laborer and the same money wages bought more 1 real wages <\s>
<s> if nothing more happened we could see that improvements raised real wageswithout lowering 2 profits because cost of labor remains the same since the lowered cost of the articles consumed was exactly in proportion to the increase of real wages <\s>
<s> and if the laborers chose to retain this higher standard this would be the situation <\s>
<s> sadly enough however in practice they are apt to be satisfied with the old standard and the amount of real wages to give the old standard of living can be had now for less money wages <\s>
<s> while only the same number without any increase can live at the new higher standard a larger number can live at the old lower standard <\s>
<s> in short the obstacles to an increase of population will be removed by the possession of higher money wages <\s>
<s> after a generation it is very probable that a larger number of laborers will be in existence living at the same or possibly a slightly higher standard of real wages and money wages will have fallen <\s>
<s> new methods of getting food supplies from foreign countries act equally with improvements at home <\s>
<s> effect of the progress of society in moderating fluctuations of value <\s>
<s> thus far of the effect of the progress of society on the permanent or average values and prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it remains to be considered in what manner the same progress affects their fluctuations <\s>
<s> concerning the answer to this question there can be no doubt <\s>
<s> it tends in a very high degree to diminish them <\s>
<s> in poor and backward societies as in the east and in europe during the middle ages extraordinary differences in the price of the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other because the want of roads and canals the imperfection of marine navigation and the insecurity of communications generally prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear <\s>
<s> the things most liable to fluctuations in value those directly influenced by the seasons and especially food were seldom carried to any great distances <\s>
<s> in most years accordingly there was in some part or other of any large country a real dearth while a deficiency at all considerable extending to the whole world is now a thing almost unknown <\s>

<s> characteristic features of industrial progress <\s>
<s> continuing the inquiry into the nature of the economical changes taking place in a society which is in a state of industrial progress we shall next consider what is the effect of that progress on the distribution of the produce among the various classes who share in it <\s>
<s> we may confine our attention to the system of distribution which is the most complex and which virtually includes all othersthat in which the produce of manufactures is shared between two classes laborers and capitalists and the produce of agriculture among three laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> the characteristic features of what is commonly meant by industrial progress resolve themselves mainly into three increase of capital increase of population and improvements in production understanding the last expression in its widest sense to include the process of procuring commodities from a distance as well as that of producing them <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to set out by considering each of the three causes as operating separately after which we can suppose them combined in any manner we think fit 298   2 <\s>
<s> first two cases population and capital increasing the arts of production stationary <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness we will form two general groups of these causes a <\s>
<s> the influence of population and capital improvements remaining stationary <\s>
<s> the influence of improvements population and capital remaining stationary <\s>
<s> we will first take up a and under this division make for convenience two separate suppositions i <\s>
<s> the first is that while population is advancing capital is stationary <\s>
<s> by this means we can study separately the operation of one of the factors of societary progress population and see its influence on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> there being only the same given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains more produce 2 profits rise <\s>
<s> now if the laborers were so well off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required from the soil <\s>
<s> this supply can be produced only at a greater cost and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will rise <\s>
<s> this last action 3 however will have an influence on the rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> for it was only by a reduction of real wages that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had not risen <\s>
<s> the result of this first supposition then is that the landlord is the chief gainer i <\s>
<s> 2 profits rise less if rents rise <\s>
<s> we will now take up the second supposition under a that while capital is advancing population remains stationary <\s>
<s> then of course 1 wages will rise and as there is no improvement to cheapen the cost of their real wages there will be an increase in cost of labor to the capitalist and 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> if now the laborers being better off demand more food the new food would cost more as the margin of cultivation was pushed down and 3 rents would inevitably rise <\s>
<s> but not only have the laborers received more real wages but since that change the cost as just described of these real wages has increased <\s>
<s> therefore 2 profits would fall still more than by the rise of real wages <\s>
<s> in this supposition consequently while the laborer gains so does the landlord ii <\s>
<s> 2 profits fall more if rents rise <\s>
<s> it is easy for us now to take into our view the total effects under a and see what the combined action of i and ii would be <\s>
<s> that is if both capital and population improvements remaining stationary increase what will be the effect on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> of course we must suppose that capital and population just keep pace with each other and in that case 1 real wages remain the same each laborer receiving the same quantity and same quality of commodities as before <\s>
<s> hence if each laborer receives the same quantity as before and there are many more laborers there will be an increased demand put upon the soil for food poorer soils will be cultivated and the cost of the products will rise <\s>
<s> so 3 rents rise <\s>
<s> but if each laborer receives the same quantity of real wages as before and the cost of them has risen as just explained an increased cost of labor will result which must come out of profits <\s>
<s> 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> so that the results of a upon distribution taken separately from b are that the owner of capital loses but the owner of land again gains <\s>
<s> 1 wages the same <\s>
<s> the arts of production advancing capital and population stationary <\s>
<s> now let us go back to our first general group of causes ban advance in the arts of production while capital and population remain stationary <\s>
<s> we can now study by themselves the effect of improvements on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> the general effects arising from the extended introduction of machinery into agriculture and manufactures the lowered cost of transportation by steam have been to lessen the value of articles consumed chiefly by the laboring classes <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness imagine that the improvement comes suddenly <\s>
<s> the first effect will be to lower the value and price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborers and if those consist mostly of food there will be a rise in the margin of cultivation and a fall in rents 3 <\s>
<s> it has been previously shown 299 that improvements retard or put back the law of diminishing returns from land or in manufactures compensate for it and so lower rents <\s>
<s> the poorest soil cultivated is now of a better grade than before and the produce is yielded at a less cost and value so that the land with which the best grades are compared to determine the rent is not separated from the best grades by so wide a gap <\s>
<s> it would at first blush seem then that the interests of the landlord were antagonistic to improvements since they lower rents but in practice it is not so as we shall soon see <\s>
<s> we have seen that improvements cheapen the price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborer <\s>
<s> having had a given sum as money wages before the change then when the sudden change of improvements came it lowered prices to the laborer and the same money wages bought more 1 real wages <\s>
<s> if nothing more happened we could see that improvements raised real wageswithout lowering 2 profits because cost of labor remains the same since the lowered cost of the articles consumed was exactly in proportion to the increase of real wages <\s>
<s> and if the laborers chose to retain this higher standard this would be the situation <\s>
<s> sadly enough however in practice they are apt to be satisfied with the old standard and the amount of real wages to give the old standard of living can be had now for less money wages <\s>
<s> while only the same number without any increase can live at the new higher standard a larger number can live at the old lower standard <\s>
<s> in short the obstacles to an increase of population will be removed by the possession of higher money wages <\s>
<s> after a generation it is very probable that a larger number of laborers will be in existence living at the same or possibly a slightly higher standard of real wages and money wages will have fallen <\s>
<s> new methods of getting food supplies from foreign countries act equally with improvements at home <\s>
<s> effect of the progress of society in moderating fluctuations of value <\s>
<s> thus far of the effect of the progress of society on the permanent or average values and prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it remains to be considered in what manner the same progress affects their fluctuations <\s>
<s> concerning the answer to this question there can be no doubt <\s>
<s> it tends in a very high degree to diminish them <\s>
<s> in poor and backward societies as in the east and in europe during the middle ages extraordinary differences in the price of the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other because the want of roads and canals the imperfection of marine navigation and the insecurity of communications generally prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear <\s>
<s> the things most liable to fluctuations in value those directly influenced by the seasons and especially food were seldom carried to any great distances <\s>
<s> in most years accordingly there was in some part or other of any large country a real dearth while a deficiency at all considerable extending to the whole world is now a thing almost unknown <\s>
<s> in modern times therefore there is only dearth where there formerly would have been famine and sufficiency everywhere when anciently there would have been scarcity in some places and superfluity in others <\s>
<s> the same change has taken place with respect to all other articles of commerce <\s>
<s> the safety and cheapness of communications which enable a deficiency in one place to be supplied from the surplus of another at a moderate or even a small advance on the ordinary price render the fluctuations of prices much less extreme than formerly <\s>
<s> this effect is much promoted by the existence of large capitals belonging to what are called speculative merchants whose business it is to buy goods in order to resell them at a profit <\s>
<s> these dealers naturally buying things when they are cheapest and storing them up to be brought again into the market when the price has become unusually high the tendency of their operations is to equalize price or at least to moderate its inequalities <\s>
<s> the prices of things are neither so much depressed at one time nor so much raised at another as they would be if speculative dealers did not exist <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    speculative    in a different sense from that which is customary in this country <\s>
<s> merchants who buy outright and store up grain are not speculators in the sense in which the word is used with us but those gamblers who purchase    for future delivery    grain which they never see and which they sell in the same way are here known as speculators <\s>
<s> it appears then that the fluctuations of values and prices arising from variations of supply or from alterations in real as distinguished from speculative demand may be expected to become more moderate as society advances <\s>
<s> with regard to those which arise from miscalculation and especially from the alternations of undue expansion and excessive contraction of credit which occupy so conspicuous a place among commercial phenomena the same thing can not be affirmed with equal confidence <\s>
<s> such vicissitudes beginning with irrational speculation and ending with a commercial crisis have not hitherto become either less frequent or less violent with the growth of capital and extension of industry <\s>
<s> rather they may be said to have become more so in consequence as is often said of increased competition but as i prefer to say of a lower rate of profits and interest which makes capitalists dissatisfied with the ordinary course of safe mercantile gains <\s>
<s> the connection of this low rate of profit with the advance of population and accumulation is one of the points to be illustrated in the ensuing chapters <\s>
<s> cairnes also adds some investigations as to the fluctuations of value    hitherto i have examined the derivative laws of value in so far only as they are exemplified in the movements of normal prices <\s>
<s> it will be interesting now to consider whether it is possible to discover in the movements of market prices any corresponding phenomena <\s>
<s>    taking manufactures first it is evident at once that as regards conditions of protection the circumstances of the case are such as to secure in general 1 great rapidity and great certainty in bringing commodities to market <\s>
<s> a deal table may be made in a few hours a piece of cloth in a few weeks and a moderate sized house in a month or little more <\s>
<s> tables cloth and houses may be produced with certainty in any quantity required <\s>
<s> it results from this that it is scarcely possible that under ordinary circumstances the selling price of a product of manufacture should for any long time much exceed its normal price <\s>
<s> 2 the nature of manufactures is in general such as to fit them admirably for distant transport <\s>
<s> any considerable elevation of price therefore is pretty certain to attract supplies from remote sources <\s>
<s> 3 further considered in their relation to human needs i think it may be said of manufactured goods that either the need for them is not very urgent or where it happens to be so substitutes ... <\s>
<s> may easily be found <\s>
<s> from all these circumstances it results that an advance in the price ... <\s>
<s> either attracts supplies or deters purchasers ... <\s>
<s> preventing any great departure from the usual terms of the market <\s>
<s>    turning now to the products of agricultural pastoral or more generally    extractive    industry we find the circumstances under which this class of goods is brought to market in all respects extremely different from those which we have just examined and such as to permit a much wider margin of deviation for the market from the normal price <\s>
<s> here the period of production is longer the result of the process much more uncertain the commodity at once more perishable and less portable and human requirements in relation to it are mostly of a more urgent kind 1 the shortest period within which additions can be made to the supply of food and raw material of the vegetable kind is in general a year and if the commodity be of animal origin the minimum is considerably larger <\s>
<s> 2 again the farmer may decide upon the breadth of ground to be devoted to a particular crop or upon the number of cattle he will maintain but the actual returns will vary according to the season and may prove far in excess or far in defect of his calculations <\s>
<s> these circumstances all present obstacles to the adjustment of supply and demand and consequently tend to produce frequent and extensive deviations of the market from the normal price <\s>
<s> nor are the other conditions of the case such as to neutralize the influence of such disturbing agencies <\s>
<s> 3 the nature indeed of some of the principal agricultural products fits them sufficiently well for distant transport and so far tends to correct fluctuations of price <\s>
<s> but on the other hand 4 the relation of these products to human wants is such as greatly to enhance that tendency to violent fluctuation incident to the conditions of their production <\s>

<s> we can now study by themselves the effect of improvements on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> the general effects arising from the extended introduction of machinery into agriculture and manufactures the lowered cost of transportation by steam have been to lessen the value of articles consumed chiefly by the laboring classes <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness imagine that the improvement comes suddenly <\s>
<s> the first effect will be to lower the value and price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborers and if those consist mostly of food there will be a rise in the margin of cultivation and a fall in rents 3 <\s>
<s> it has been previously shown 299 that improvements retard or put back the law of diminishing returns from land or in manufactures compensate for it and so lower rents <\s>
<s> the poorest soil cultivated is now of a better grade than before and the produce is yielded at a less cost and value so that the land with which the best grades are compared to determine the rent is not separated from the best grades by so wide a gap <\s>
<s> it would at first blush seem then that the interests of the landlord were antagonistic to improvements since they lower rents but in practice it is not so as we shall soon see <\s>
<s> we have seen that improvements cheapen the price of articles entering into the real wages of the laborer <\s>
<s> having had a given sum as money wages before the change then when the sudden change of improvements came it lowered prices to the laborer and the same money wages bought more 1 real wages <\s>
<s> if nothing more happened we could see that improvements raised real wageswithout lowering 2 profits because cost of labor remains the same since the lowered cost of the articles consumed was exactly in proportion to the increase of real wages <\s>
<s> and if the laborers chose to retain this higher standard this would be the situation <\s>
<s> sadly enough however in practice they are apt to be satisfied with the old standard and the amount of real wages to give the old standard of living can be had now for less money wages <\s>
<s> while only the same number without any increase can live at the new higher standard a larger number can live at the old lower standard <\s>
<s> in short the obstacles to an increase of population will be removed by the possession of higher money wages <\s>
<s> after a generation it is very probable that a larger number of laborers will be in existence living at the same or possibly a slightly higher standard of real wages and money wages will have fallen <\s>
<s> new methods of getting food supplies from foreign countries act equally with improvements at home <\s>
<s> effect of the progress of society in moderating fluctuations of value <\s>
<s> thus far of the effect of the progress of society on the permanent or average values and prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it remains to be considered in what manner the same progress affects their fluctuations <\s>
<s> concerning the answer to this question there can be no doubt <\s>
<s> it tends in a very high degree to diminish them <\s>
<s> in poor and backward societies as in the east and in europe during the middle ages extraordinary differences in the price of the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other because the want of roads and canals the imperfection of marine navigation and the insecurity of communications generally prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear <\s>
<s> the things most liable to fluctuations in value those directly influenced by the seasons and especially food were seldom carried to any great distances <\s>
<s> in most years accordingly there was in some part or other of any large country a real dearth while a deficiency at all considerable extending to the whole world is now a thing almost unknown <\s>
<s> in modern times therefore there is only dearth where there formerly would have been famine and sufficiency everywhere when anciently there would have been scarcity in some places and superfluity in others <\s>
<s> the same change has taken place with respect to all other articles of commerce <\s>
<s> the safety and cheapness of communications which enable a deficiency in one place to be supplied from the surplus of another at a moderate or even a small advance on the ordinary price render the fluctuations of prices much less extreme than formerly <\s>
<s> this effect is much promoted by the existence of large capitals belonging to what are called speculative merchants whose business it is to buy goods in order to resell them at a profit <\s>
<s> these dealers naturally buying things when they are cheapest and storing them up to be brought again into the market when the price has become unusually high the tendency of their operations is to equalize price or at least to moderate its inequalities <\s>
<s> the prices of things are neither so much depressed at one time nor so much raised at another as they would be if speculative dealers did not exist <\s>
<s> mill uses the term    speculative    in a different sense from that which is customary in this country <\s>
<s> merchants who buy outright and store up grain are not speculators in the sense in which the word is used with us but those gamblers who purchase    for future delivery    grain which they never see and which they sell in the same way are here known as speculators <\s>
<s> it appears then that the fluctuations of values and prices arising from variations of supply or from alterations in real as distinguished from speculative demand may be expected to become more moderate as society advances <\s>
<s> with regard to those which arise from miscalculation and especially from the alternations of undue expansion and excessive contraction of credit which occupy so conspicuous a place among commercial phenomena the same thing can not be affirmed with equal confidence <\s>
<s> such vicissitudes beginning with irrational speculation and ending with a commercial crisis have not hitherto become either less frequent or less violent with the growth of capital and extension of industry <\s>
<s> rather they may be said to have become more so in consequence as is often said of increased competition but as i prefer to say of a lower rate of profits and interest which makes capitalists dissatisfied with the ordinary course of safe mercantile gains <\s>
<s> the connection of this low rate of profit with the advance of population and accumulation is one of the points to be illustrated in the ensuing chapters <\s>
<s> cairnes also adds some investigations as to the fluctuations of value    hitherto i have examined the derivative laws of value in so far only as they are exemplified in the movements of normal prices <\s>
<s> it will be interesting now to consider whether it is possible to discover in the movements of market prices any corresponding phenomena <\s>
<s>    taking manufactures first it is evident at once that as regards conditions of protection the circumstances of the case are such as to secure in general 1 great rapidity and great certainty in bringing commodities to market <\s>
<s> a deal table may be made in a few hours a piece of cloth in a few weeks and a moderate sized house in a month or little more <\s>
<s> tables cloth and houses may be produced with certainty in any quantity required <\s>
<s> it results from this that it is scarcely possible that under ordinary circumstances the selling price of a product of manufacture should for any long time much exceed its normal price <\s>
<s> 2 the nature of manufactures is in general such as to fit them admirably for distant transport <\s>
<s> any considerable elevation of price therefore is pretty certain to attract supplies from remote sources <\s>
<s> 3 further considered in their relation to human needs i think it may be said of manufactured goods that either the need for them is not very urgent or where it happens to be so substitutes ... <\s>
<s> may easily be found <\s>
<s> from all these circumstances it results that an advance in the price ... <\s>
<s> either attracts supplies or deters purchasers ... <\s>
<s> preventing any great departure from the usual terms of the market <\s>
<s>    turning now to the products of agricultural pastoral or more generally    extractive    industry we find the circumstances under which this class of goods is brought to market in all respects extremely different from those which we have just examined and such as to permit a much wider margin of deviation for the market from the normal price <\s>
<s> here the period of production is longer the result of the process much more uncertain the commodity at once more perishable and less portable and human requirements in relation to it are mostly of a more urgent kind 1 the shortest period within which additions can be made to the supply of food and raw material of the vegetable kind is in general a year and if the commodity be of animal origin the minimum is considerably larger <\s>
<s> 2 again the farmer may decide upon the breadth of ground to be devoted to a particular crop or upon the number of cattle he will maintain but the actual returns will vary according to the season and may prove far in excess or far in defect of his calculations <\s>
<s> these circumstances all present obstacles to the adjustment of supply and demand and consequently tend to produce frequent and extensive deviations of the market from the normal price <\s>
<s> nor are the other conditions of the case such as to neutralize the influence of such disturbing agencies <\s>
<s> 3 the nature indeed of some of the principal agricultural products fits them sufficiently well for distant transport and so far tends to correct fluctuations of price <\s>
<s> but on the other hand 4 the relation of these products to human wants is such as greatly to enhance that tendency to violent fluctuation incident to the conditions of their production <\s>
<s> more especially is this the case with the commodity whatever it may be which forms the staple food of a people <\s>
<s> for observe the peculiar nature of human requirements with reference to such a commodity <\s>
<s> they are of this kind that given the number of a population the quantity of the staple food required is nearly a fixed quantity and this almost irrespective of price <\s>
<s> except among the poorest increased cheapness will not stimulate a larger consumption while on the other hand all at any cost within the range of their means will obtain their usual supply <\s>
<s> the consequence is that when even a moderate deficiency or excess occurs in the supply of the staple food of a people in the one case a the competition of consumers for their usual quantum of food rapidly forces up the price far out of proportion to the diminution in the supply in the other b no one being inclined to increase his usual consumption the competition of sellers in their eagerness to find a market for the superfluous portion of the supply is equally powerful to depress it    chapter ii <\s>
<s> influence of the progress of industry and population on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> characteristic features of industrial progress <\s>
<s> continuing the inquiry into the nature of the economical changes taking place in a society which is in a state of industrial progress we shall next consider what is the effect of that progress on the distribution of the produce among the various classes who share in it <\s>
<s> we may confine our attention to the system of distribution which is the most complex and which virtually includes all othersthat in which the produce of manufactures is shared between two classes laborers and capitalists and the produce of agriculture among three laborers capitalists and landlords <\s>
<s> the characteristic features of what is commonly meant by industrial progress resolve themselves mainly into three increase of capital increase of population and improvements in production understanding the last expression in its widest sense to include the process of procuring commodities from a distance as well as that of producing them <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to set out by considering each of the three causes as operating separately after which we can suppose them combined in any manner we think fit 298   2 <\s>
<s> first two cases population and capital increasing the arts of production stationary <\s>
<s> for the sake of clearness we will form two general groups of these causes a <\s>
<s> the influence of population and capital improvements remaining stationary <\s>
<s> the influence of improvements population and capital remaining stationary <\s>
<s> we will first take up a and under this division make for convenience two separate suppositions i <\s>
<s> the first is that while population is advancing capital is stationary <\s>
<s> by this means we can study separately the operation of one of the factors of societary progress population and see its influence on rents profits and wages <\s>
<s> there being only the same given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains more produce 2 profits rise <\s>
<s> now if the laborers were so well off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required from the soil <\s>
<s> this supply can be produced only at a greater cost and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will rise <\s>
<s> this last action 3 however will have an influence on the rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> for it was only by a reduction of real wages that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had not risen <\s>
<s> the result of this first supposition then is that the landlord is the chief gainer i <\s>
<s> 2 profits rise less if rents rise <\s>
<s> we will now take up the second supposition under a that while capital is advancing population remains stationary <\s>
<s> then of course 1 wages will rise and as there is no improvement to cheapen the cost of their real wages there will be an increase in cost of labor to the capitalist and 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> if now the laborers being better off demand more food the new food would cost more as the margin of cultivation was pushed down and 3 rents would inevitably rise <\s>
<s> but not only have the laborers received more real wages but since that change the cost as just described of these real wages has increased <\s>
<s> therefore 2 profits would fall still more than by the rise of real wages <\s>
<s> in this supposition consequently while the laborer gains so does the landlord ii <\s>
<s> 2 profits fall more if rents rise <\s>
<s> it is easy for us now to take into our view the total effects under a and see what the combined action of i and ii would be <\s>
<s> that is if both capital and population improvements remaining stationary increase what will be the effect on wages profits and rent <\s>
<s> of course we must suppose that capital and population just keep pace with each other and in that case 1 real wages remain the same each laborer receiving the same quantity and same quality of commodities as before <\s>
<s> hence if each laborer receives the same quantity as before and there are many more laborers there will be an increased demand put upon the soil for food poorer soils will be cultivated and the cost of the products will rise <\s>
<s> so 3 rents rise <\s>
<s> but if each laborer receives the same quantity of real wages as before and the cost of them has risen as just explained an increased cost of labor will result which must come out of profits <\s>
<s> 2 profits will fall <\s>
<s> so that the results of a upon distribution taken separately from b are that the owner of capital loses but the owner of land again gains <\s>
<s> 1 wages the same <\s>
<s> the arts of production advancing capital and population stationary <\s>
<s> now let us go back to our first general group of causes ban advance in the arts of production while capital and population remain stationary <\s>
<s> we can now study by themselves the effect of improvements on wages profits and rent <\s>
