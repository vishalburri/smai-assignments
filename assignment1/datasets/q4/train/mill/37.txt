<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>
<s> wakefields explanation of the fall of profits is briefly this production is limited not solely by the quantity of capital and of labor but also by the extent of the    field of employment    the field of employment for capital is twofold the land of the country and the capacity of foreign markets to take its manufactured commodities <\s>

<s> what determines the minimum rate of profit <\s>
<s> there is at every time and place some particular rate of profit which is the lowest that will induce the people of that country and time to accumulate savings and to employ those savings productively <\s>

<s> it depends on two elements one is the strength of the effective desire of accumulation the comparative estimate made by the people of that place and era of future interests when weighed against present <\s>
<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> when a country has long possessed a large production and a large net income to make savings from and when therefore the means have long existed of making a great annual addition to capital the country not having like america a large reserve of fertile land still unused it is one of the characteristics of such a country that the rate of profit is habitually within as it were a hands breadth of the minimum and the country therefore on the very verge of the stationary state <\s>
<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>
<s> if the new capital were duly shared among many varieties of employment it would raise up a demand for its own produce and there would be no cause why any part of that produce should remain longer on hand than formerly <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>

<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>

<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>

<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>

<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>

<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>

<s> 3 rent has fallen money wages have fallen even if 2 real wages have not ); and since real wages have not fallen in the proportion that their cost has been reduced 2 profits will have risen <\s>
<s> the general result of the causes under b alone acting as just described will then be b <\s>
<s> 1 real wages remain the same money wages less <\s>
<s> theoretical results if all three elements progressive <\s>
<s> we have considered on the one hand under a the manner in which the distribution of the produce into rent profits and wages is affected by the ordinary increase of population and capital and on the other under b how it is affected by improvements in production and more especially in agriculture as follows a <\s>
<s> 1 wages the same <\s>
<s> 1 real wages the same money wages less <\s>
<s> the effects are clearly contrasted <\s>
<s> under a we see a tendency to a rise of rents 3 an increased cost of labor and a fall of profits 2 ); under b a fall of rents 3 a diminished cost of labor and a rise of profits 2 <\s>
<s> we have therefore analyzed the forces belonging to the progress of industry and found two distinct and antagonistic forces working against each other <\s>
<s> if at any period improvements b advance faster than population and capital a rent and money wages will tend downward and profits upward <\s>
<s> if on the other hand population advances faster than improvements b either the laborers will submit to a reduction in the quantity or quality of their food or if not rent and money wages will progressively rise and profits will fall <\s>
<s> this however is not the final and practical result <\s>
<s> we have hitherto supposed that improvements b come suddenly <\s>
<s> in point of fact agricultural skill is slowly diffused and inventions and discoveries are in general only occasional not continuous in their action as is the increase of capital and population <\s>
<s> inasmuch as it seldom happens that improvement has so much the start of population and capital as actually to lower rent or raise the rate of profits population almost everywhere    treads close on the heels of agricultural improvement    and effaces its effects as fast as they are produced <\s>
<s> the reason why agricultural improvement seldom lowers rent is that it seldom cheapens food but only prevents it from growing dearer and seldom if ever throws land out of cultivation but only enables worse and worse land to be taken in for the supply of an increasing demand <\s>
<s> what is sometimes called the natural state of a country which is but half cultivated namely that the land is highly productive and food obtained in great abundance by little labor is only true of unoccupied countries colonized by a civilized people <\s>
<s> in the united states the worst land in cultivation is of a high quality except sometimes in the immediate vicinity of markets or means of conveyance where a bad quality is compensated by a good situation ); and even if no further improvements were made in agriculture or locomotion cultivation would have many steps yet to descend before the increase of population and capital would be brought to a stand but in europe five hundred years ago though so thinly peopled in comparison to the present population it is probable that the worst land under the plow was from the rude state of agriculture quite as unproductive as the worst land now cultivated and that cultivation had approached as near to the ultimate limit of profitable tillage in those times as in the present <\s>
<s> what the agricultural improvements since made have really done is by increasing the capacity of production of land in general to enable tillage to extend downward to a much worse natural quality of land than the worst which at that time would have admitted of cultivation by a capitalist for profit thus rendering a much greater increase of capital and population possible and removing always a little and a little further off the barrier which restrains them population meanwhile always pressing so hard against the barrier that there is never any visible margin left for it to seize every inch of ground made vacant for it by improvement being at once filled up by its advancing columns <\s>
<s> agricultural improvement may thus be considered to be not so much a counter force conflicting with increase of population as a partial relaxation of the bonds which confine that increase <\s>
<s> now since improvements enable a much poorer quality of land to be ultimately cultivated under the constant pressure of the increase of population and capital improvements enable rent 3 in the end to rise gradually to a much higher limit than it could otherwise have attained <\s>
<s> if a great agricultural improvement were suddenly introduced it might throw back rent for a considerable space leaving it to regain its lost ground by the progress of population and capital and afterward to go on further <\s>
<s> but taking place as such improvement always does very gradually it causes no retrograde movement of either rent or cultivation it merely enables the one to go on rising and the other extending long after they must otherwise have stopped <\s>
<s> inasmuch as in point of fact b never gets the start of a but follows along with a the general result will be that which we found true under aa rise of rents 3 and increased cost of labor to the capitalist arising from an increased cost of laborers    subsistence and a fall of profits 2 <\s>
<s> the effect of a more rapid advance of improvements at any one time will temporarily better the condition of the laborers and also raise profits but if it is followed immediately by an increase of population the land owners will reap the benefits of the improvement in the rise of rent <\s>
<s> the final result then is as follows 1 real wages probably higher <\s>
<s> it is possible that a different combination from the above may sometimes occur in the causes which underlie the progress of society 1 there may be a period in which capital is increasing more rapidly than population and when there seems to be an era of industrial improvements also <\s>
<s> then both wages and profits will be high and it will be a period of general satisfaction <\s>
<s> 2 if capital goes on increasing but improvements are few wages will rise but profits must suffer a fall <\s>
<s> in this country where population has not yet increased so as to press seriously against subsistence and where capital increases with incredible swiftness these cases are often exemplified <\s>
<s> the extraordinary resources of the newer states have permitted an unlimited increase of population and capital has found no difficulty in finding an investment <\s>
<s> but yet those states which have been burdened with the disabilities of the old slave r  gime are far behind the others <\s>

<s> of the tendency of profits to a minimum <\s>
<s> different theories as to the fall of profits <\s>
<s> the tendency of profits to fall as society advances which has been brought to notice in the preceding chapter was early recognized by writers on industry and commerce but the laws which govern profits not being then understood the phenomenon was ascribed to a wrong cause <\s>
<s> adam smith considered profits to be determined by what he called the competition of capital <\s>
<s> in adam smiths opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade <\s>
<s> but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns <\s>
<s> unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital <\s>
<s> there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place <\s>
<s> prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply <\s>
<s> the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices <\s>
<s> now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities <\s>
<s> for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments <\s>
<s> if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines <\s>
<s> it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices <\s>
<s> neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact <\s>
<s> the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics <\s>
<s> other things again instead of falling have risen in price because their cost of production compared with that of gold and silver has increased <\s>
<s> among these are all kinds of food comparison being made with a much earlier period of history <\s>
<s> the doctrine therefore that competition of capital lowers profits by lowering prices is incorrect in fact as well as unsound in principle <\s>
<s> wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important <\s>
<s> wakefields explanation of the fall of profits is briefly this production is limited not solely by the quantity of capital and of labor but also by the extent of the    field of employment    the field of employment for capital is twofold the land of the country and the capacity of foreign markets to take its manufactured commodities <\s>
<s> on a limited extent of land only a limited quantity of capital can find employment at a profit <\s>
<s> as the quantity of capital approaches this limit profit falls when the limit is attained profit is annihilated and can only be restored through an extension of the field of employment either by the acquisition of fertile land or by opening new markets in foreign countries from which food and materials can be purchased with the products of domestic capital 300   2 <\s>
<s> what determines the minimum rate of profit <\s>
<s> there is at every time and place some particular rate of profit which is the lowest that will induce the people of that country and time to accumulate savings and to employ those savings productively <\s>
<s> this minimum rate of profit varies according to circumstances <\s>
<s> it depends on two elements one is the strength of the effective desire of accumulation the comparative estimate made by the people of that place and era of future interests when weighed against present <\s>
<s> this element chiefly affects the inclination to save <\s>
<s> the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations <\s>
<s> in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody <\s>
<s> this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate <\s>
<s> there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit <\s>
<s> there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it <\s>
<s> savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence <\s>
<s> the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions <\s>
<s> now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of self denial which again depends on the rate of profit <\s>
<s> and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves <\s>
<s> any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profita rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk <\s>
<s> i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security <\s>
<s> destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended <\s>
<s> the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present <\s>
<s> 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future <\s>
<s> this increase of providence is a natural result of the increased assurance with which futurity can be looked forward to and is besides favored by most of the influences which an industrial life exercises over the passions and inclinations of human nature <\s>
<s> in proportion as life has fewer vicissitudes as habits become more fixed and great prizes are less and less to be hoped for by any other means than long perseverance mankind become more willing to sacrifice present indulgence for future objects <\s>
<s> but though the minimum rate of profit is liable to vary and though to specify exactly what it is would at any given time be impossible such a minimum always exists and whether it be high or low when once it is reached no further increase of capital can for the present take place <\s>
<s> the country has then attained what is known to political economists under the name of the stationary state <\s>
<s> in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum <\s>
<s> we now arrive at the fundamental proposition which this chapter is intended to inculcate <\s>
<s> when a country has long possessed a large production and a large net income to make savings from and when therefore the means have long existed of making a great annual addition to capital the country not having like america a large reserve of fertile land still unused it is one of the characteristics of such a country that the rate of profit is habitually within as it were a hands breadth of the minimum and the country therefore on the very verge of the stationary state <\s>
<s> my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time <\s>
<s> in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed <\s>
<s> let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement <\s>
<s> i now say that the mere continuance of the present annual increase of capital if no circumstance occurred to counteract its effect would suffice in a small number of years to reduce the rate of net profit to one per cent <\s>
<s> to fulfill the conditions of the hypothesis we must suppose an entire cessation of the exportation of capital for foreign investment <\s>
<s> we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the best known processes for inferior ones <\s>
<s> the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market <\s>
<s> if the new capital were duly shared among many varieties of employment it would raise up a demand for its own produce and there would be no cause why any part of that produce should remain longer on hand than formerly <\s>
<s> what would really be not merely difficult but impossible would be to employ this capital without submitting to a rapid reduction of the rate of profit <\s>
<s> as capital increased population either would also increase or it would not <\s>
<s> if it did not wages would rise and a greater capital would be distributed in wages among the same number of laborers <\s>
<s> there being no more labor than before and no improvements to render the labor more efficient there would not be any increase of the produce and as the capital however largely increased would only obtain the same gross return the whole savings of each year would be exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of every following year <\s>
<s> illustration this can be illustrated by supposing that the whole capital is handed out to the producers in a vessel which is returned full at the end of the period of production with the original outlay plus an advance called profit <\s>
