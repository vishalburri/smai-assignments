<s> in this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy <\s>

<s> this premium as it is called the buyers are willing to pay because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business <\s>

<s> the reverse of all this happens if on the comparison of exports and imports the country instead of having a balance to pay has a balance to receive <\s>
<s> the brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant <\s>
<s> bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount and the competition among the brokers which is exceedingly active prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance <\s>
<s> when the united states had the same number of dollars to pay to england which england had to pay to her one set of merchants in the united states would want bills and another set would have bills to dispose of for the very same number of dollars and consequently a bill on england for 1,000 would sell for exactly 1,000 or in the phraseology of merchants the exchange would be at par <\s>
<s> as england also on this supposition would have an equal number of dollars to pay and to receive bills on the united states would be at par in england whenever bills on england were at par in the united states <\s>
<s> if however the united states had a larger sum to pay to england than to receive from her there would be persons requiring bills on england for a greater number of dollars than there were bills drawn by persons to whom money was due <\s>
<s> a bill on england for 1,000 would then sell for more than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a premium <\s>
<s> the premium however could not exceed the cost and risk of making the remittance in gold together with a trifling profit because if it did the debtor would send the gold itself in preference to buying the bill <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the united states had more money to receive from england than to pay there would be bills offered for a greater number of dollars than were wanted for remittance and the price of bills would fall below par a bill for 1,000 might be bought for somewhat less than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a discount <\s>
<s> when the united states has more to pay than to receive england has more to receive than to pay and vice versa <\s>
<s> when therefore in the united states bills on england bear a premium then in england bills on the united states are at a discount and when bills on england are at a discount in the united states bills on the united states are at a premium in england <\s>
<s> if they are at par in either country they are so as we have already seen in both 275 thus do matters stand between countries or places which have the same currency <\s>
<s> so much of barbarism however still remains in the transactions of the most civilized nations that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having to their own inconvenience and that of their neighbors a peculiar currency of their own <\s>
<s> to our present purpose this makes no other difference than that instead of speaking of equal sums of money we have to speak of equivalent sums <\s>
<s> by equivalent sums when both currencies are composed of the same metal are meant sums which contain exactly the same quantity of the metal in weight and fineness <\s>
<s> the quantity of gold in the english pound is equivalent to 4.8666+ of our gold coins <\s>
<s> if the bills offered are about equal to those wanted a claim to a pound in england will sell for 4.86 <\s>
<s> if many are wanted and but few to be had their price will go up of course but it can not go more than a small fraction beyond 4.90 since about 3  cents is sufficient to cover the brokerage insurance and freight per pound sterling in a shipment of gold to london <\s>
<s> therefore in order to get money to a creditor in london no one will pay more for a pound in the form of a bill than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form of bullion <\s>
<s> bills of exchange then can not rise in price beyond the point 4.90 since rather than pay a higher sum for a bill gold will be sent <\s>
<s> this point is called the    shipping point    of gold <\s>
<s> when the exchanges are at 4.90 it will be found that gold is going abroad <\s>
<s> on the other hand when the supply of bills is greater than the demand their price will fall <\s>
<s> a man having a bill on london to selli e a claim to a pound in londonwill not sell it at a price here lower than 4.86 by more than the expense of bringing the gold itself across <\s>
<s> since this expense is about 3  cents bills can not fall below about 4.83 <\s>
<s> when exchange is at that price it will be found that gold is coming to the united states from england <\s>
<s> this price is the    shipping point    for imports of gold <\s>
<s> this of course applies to sight bills only <\s>
<s> formerly we computed exchange on a scale of percentages the real par being about 109 <\s>
<s> this was given up after the war <\s>
<s> when bills on foreign countries are at a premium it is customary to say that the exchanges are against the country or unfavorable to it <\s>
<s> in order to understand these phrases we must take notice of what    the exchange    in the language of merchants really means <\s>
<s> it means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries <\s>
<s> supposing 4.86 to be the exact par of exchange then when it requires more than 1,000 to buy a bill of   205 1,000 of american money are worth less than their real equivalent of english money and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the united states <\s>
<s> the only persons in the united states however to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in england for they come into the bill market as buyers and have to pay a premium but to those who have money to receive in england the same state of things is favorable for they come as sellers and receive the premium <\s>
<s> the premium however indicates that a balance is due by the united states which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals and since according to the old theory the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice <\s>
<s> distinction between variations in the exchanges which are self adjusting and those which can only be rectified through prices <\s>
<s> it might be supposed at first sight that when the exchange is unfavorable or in other words when bills are at a premium the premium must always amount to a full equivalent for the cost of transmitting money <\s>
<s> but a small excess of imports above exports or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries does not usually affect the exchanges to the full extent of the cost and risk of transporting bullion <\s>
<s> the length of credit allowed generally permits on the part of some of the debtors a postponement of payment and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals <\s>
<s> and this is the more likely to happen as there is a self adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself <\s>
<s> bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported <\s>
<s> but the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export <\s>
<s> besides the price they obtain for their goods they draw for the amount and gain the premium <\s>
<s> it is on the other hand a diminution of profit to those who import <\s>
<s> besides the price of the goods they have to pay a premium for remittance <\s>
<s> so that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export and a discouragement to import <\s>
<s> and if the balance due is of small amount and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade it is soon liquidated in commodities and the account adjusted by means of bills without the transmission of any bullion <\s>
<s> not so however when the excess of imports above exports which has made the exchange unfavorable arises from a permanent cause <\s>
<s> in that case what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices and it can only be restored by acting on prices <\s>
<s> it is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills for if the exports were kept up to the imports bills would not be at a premium and the extra profit would not exist <\s>
<s> it is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered <\s>
<s> disturbances therefore of the equilibrium of imports and exports and consequent disturbances of the exchange may be considered as of two classes the one casual or accidental which if not on too large a scale correct themselves through the premium on bills without any transmission of the precious metals the other arising from the general state of prices which can not be corrected without the subtraction of actual money from the circulation of one of the countries or an annihilation of credit equivalent to it <\s>
<s> it remains to observe that the exchanges do not depend on the balance of debts and credits with each country separately but with all countries taken together <\s>
<s> the united states may owe a balance of payments to england but it does not follow that the exchange with england will be against the united states and that bills on england will be at a premium because a balance may be due to the united states from holland or hamburg and she may pay her debts to england with bills on those places which is technically called arbitration of exchange <\s>
<s> there is some little additional expense partly commission and partly loss of interest in settling debts in this circuitous manner and to the extent of that small difference the exchange with one country may vary apart from that with others <\s>
<s> a common use of bills of exchange is that by which when three countries are concerned two of them may strike a balance through the third if both countries have dealings with that third country <\s>
<s> new york merchants may buy of china but china may not be buying of new york although both may have dealings with london <\s>

<s> the nearest analogy would lead us to presume the negative <\s>
<s> we did not find that the intervention of money and its substitutes made any difference in the law of value as applied to adjacent places <\s>

<s> we shall not be surprised therefore if we find that international values also are determined by the same causes under a money and bill system as they would be under a system of barter and that money has little to do in the matter except to furnish a convenient mode of comparing values <\s>
<s> all interchange is in substance and effect barter whoever sells commodities for money and with that money buys other goods really buys those goods with his own commodities <\s>
<s> and so of nations their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports and whether money is employed or not things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> when this is the case equal sums of money are due from each country to the other the debts are settled by bills and there is no balance to be paid in the precious metals <\s>
<s> the trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium <\s>
<s> but the process by which things are brought back to this state when they happen to deviate from it is at least outwardly not the same in a barter system and in a money system <\s>
<s> under the first the country which wants more imports than its exports will pay for must offer its exports at a cheaper rate as the sole means of creating a demand for them sufficient to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when money is used the country seems to do a thing totally different <\s>
<s> she takes the additional imports at the same price as before and as she exports no equivalent the balance of payments turns against her the exchange becomes unfavorable and the difference has to be paid in money <\s>

<s> by this transmission of the precious metals the quantity of the currency is diminished in the united states and increased in england <\s>

<s> we are now supposing that there is an excess of imports over exports arising from the fact that the equation of international demand is not yet established that there is at the ordinary prices a permanent demand in the united states for more english goods than the american goods required in england at the ordinary prices will pay for <\s>

<s> in this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy <\s>

<s> this premium as it is called the buyers are willing to pay because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business <\s>

<s> the reverse of all this happens if on the comparison of exports and imports the country instead of having a balance to pay has a balance to receive <\s>
<s> the brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant <\s>
<s> bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount and the competition among the brokers which is exceedingly active prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance <\s>
<s> when the united states had the same number of dollars to pay to england which england had to pay to her one set of merchants in the united states would want bills and another set would have bills to dispose of for the very same number of dollars and consequently a bill on england for 1,000 would sell for exactly 1,000 or in the phraseology of merchants the exchange would be at par <\s>
<s> as england also on this supposition would have an equal number of dollars to pay and to receive bills on the united states would be at par in england whenever bills on england were at par in the united states <\s>
<s> if however the united states had a larger sum to pay to england than to receive from her there would be persons requiring bills on england for a greater number of dollars than there were bills drawn by persons to whom money was due <\s>
<s> a bill on england for 1,000 would then sell for more than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a premium <\s>
<s> the premium however could not exceed the cost and risk of making the remittance in gold together with a trifling profit because if it did the debtor would send the gold itself in preference to buying the bill <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the united states had more money to receive from england than to pay there would be bills offered for a greater number of dollars than were wanted for remittance and the price of bills would fall below par a bill for 1,000 might be bought for somewhat less than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a discount <\s>
<s> when the united states has more to pay than to receive england has more to receive than to pay and vice versa <\s>
<s> when therefore in the united states bills on england bear a premium then in england bills on the united states are at a discount and when bills on england are at a discount in the united states bills on the united states are at a premium in england <\s>
<s> if they are at par in either country they are so as we have already seen in both 275 thus do matters stand between countries or places which have the same currency <\s>
<s> so much of barbarism however still remains in the transactions of the most civilized nations that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having to their own inconvenience and that of their neighbors a peculiar currency of their own <\s>
<s> to our present purpose this makes no other difference than that instead of speaking of equal sums of money we have to speak of equivalent sums <\s>
<s> by equivalent sums when both currencies are composed of the same metal are meant sums which contain exactly the same quantity of the metal in weight and fineness <\s>
<s> the quantity of gold in the english pound is equivalent to 4.8666+ of our gold coins <\s>
<s> if the bills offered are about equal to those wanted a claim to a pound in england will sell for 4.86 <\s>
<s> if many are wanted and but few to be had their price will go up of course but it can not go more than a small fraction beyond 4.90 since about 3  cents is sufficient to cover the brokerage insurance and freight per pound sterling in a shipment of gold to london <\s>
<s> therefore in order to get money to a creditor in london no one will pay more for a pound in the form of a bill than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form of bullion <\s>
<s> bills of exchange then can not rise in price beyond the point 4.90 since rather than pay a higher sum for a bill gold will be sent <\s>
<s> this point is called the    shipping point    of gold <\s>
<s> when the exchanges are at 4.90 it will be found that gold is going abroad <\s>
<s> on the other hand when the supply of bills is greater than the demand their price will fall <\s>
<s> a man having a bill on london to selli e a claim to a pound in londonwill not sell it at a price here lower than 4.86 by more than the expense of bringing the gold itself across <\s>
<s> since this expense is about 3  cents bills can not fall below about 4.83 <\s>
<s> when exchange is at that price it will be found that gold is coming to the united states from england <\s>
<s> this price is the    shipping point    for imports of gold <\s>
<s> this of course applies to sight bills only <\s>
<s> formerly we computed exchange on a scale of percentages the real par being about 109 <\s>
<s> this was given up after the war <\s>
<s> when bills on foreign countries are at a premium it is customary to say that the exchanges are against the country or unfavorable to it <\s>
<s> in order to understand these phrases we must take notice of what    the exchange    in the language of merchants really means <\s>
<s> it means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries <\s>
<s> supposing 4.86 to be the exact par of exchange then when it requires more than 1,000 to buy a bill of   205 1,000 of american money are worth less than their real equivalent of english money and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the united states <\s>
<s> the only persons in the united states however to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in england for they come into the bill market as buyers and have to pay a premium but to those who have money to receive in england the same state of things is favorable for they come as sellers and receive the premium <\s>
<s> the premium however indicates that a balance is due by the united states which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals and since according to the old theory the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice <\s>
<s> distinction between variations in the exchanges which are self adjusting and those which can only be rectified through prices <\s>
<s> it might be supposed at first sight that when the exchange is unfavorable or in other words when bills are at a premium the premium must always amount to a full equivalent for the cost of transmitting money <\s>
<s> but a small excess of imports above exports or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries does not usually affect the exchanges to the full extent of the cost and risk of transporting bullion <\s>
<s> the length of credit allowed generally permits on the part of some of the debtors a postponement of payment and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals <\s>
<s> and this is the more likely to happen as there is a self adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself <\s>
<s> bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported <\s>
<s> but the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export <\s>
<s> besides the price they obtain for their goods they draw for the amount and gain the premium <\s>
<s> it is on the other hand a diminution of profit to those who import <\s>
<s> besides the price of the goods they have to pay a premium for remittance <\s>
<s> so that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export and a discouragement to import <\s>
<s> and if the balance due is of small amount and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade it is soon liquidated in commodities and the account adjusted by means of bills without the transmission of any bullion <\s>
<s> not so however when the excess of imports above exports which has made the exchange unfavorable arises from a permanent cause <\s>
<s> in that case what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices and it can only be restored by acting on prices <\s>
<s> it is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills for if the exports were kept up to the imports bills would not be at a premium and the extra profit would not exist <\s>
<s> it is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered <\s>
<s> disturbances therefore of the equilibrium of imports and exports and consequent disturbances of the exchange may be considered as of two classes the one casual or accidental which if not on too large a scale correct themselves through the premium on bills without any transmission of the precious metals the other arising from the general state of prices which can not be corrected without the subtraction of actual money from the circulation of one of the countries or an annihilation of credit equivalent to it <\s>
<s> it remains to observe that the exchanges do not depend on the balance of debts and credits with each country separately but with all countries taken together <\s>
<s> the united states may owe a balance of payments to england but it does not follow that the exchange with england will be against the united states and that bills on england will be at a premium because a balance may be due to the united states from holland or hamburg and she may pay her debts to england with bills on those places which is technically called arbitration of exchange <\s>
<s> there is some little additional expense partly commission and partly loss of interest in settling debts in this circuitous manner and to the extent of that small difference the exchange with one country may vary apart from that with others <\s>
<s> a common use of bills of exchange is that by which when three countries are concerned two of them may strike a balance through the third if both countries have dealings with that third country <\s>
<s> new york merchants may buy of china but china may not be buying of new york although both may have dealings with london <\s>

<s> the nearest analogy would lead us to presume the negative <\s>
<s> we did not find that the intervention of money and its substitutes made any difference in the law of value as applied to adjacent places <\s>

<s> we shall not be surprised therefore if we find that international values also are determined by the same causes under a money and bill system as they would be under a system of barter and that money has little to do in the matter except to furnish a convenient mode of comparing values <\s>
<s> all interchange is in substance and effect barter whoever sells commodities for money and with that money buys other goods really buys those goods with his own commodities <\s>
<s> and so of nations their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports and whether money is employed or not things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> when this is the case equal sums of money are due from each country to the other the debts are settled by bills and there is no balance to be paid in the precious metals <\s>
<s> the trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium <\s>
<s> but the process by which things are brought back to this state when they happen to deviate from it is at least outwardly not the same in a barter system and in a money system <\s>
<s> under the first the country which wants more imports than its exports will pay for must offer its exports at a cheaper rate as the sole means of creating a demand for them sufficient to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when money is used the country seems to do a thing totally different <\s>
<s> she takes the additional imports at the same price as before and as she exports no equivalent the balance of payments turns against her the exchange becomes unfavorable and the difference has to be paid in money <\s>

<s> by this transmission of the precious metals the quantity of the currency is diminished in the united states and increased in england <\s>

<s> we are now supposing that there is an excess of imports over exports arising from the fact that the equation of international demand is not yet established that there is at the ordinary prices a permanent demand in the united states for more english goods than the american goods required in england at the ordinary prices will pay for <\s>

<s> in this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy <\s>

<s> this premium as it is called the buyers are willing to pay because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business <\s>

<s> the reverse of all this happens if on the comparison of exports and imports the country instead of having a balance to pay has a balance to receive <\s>
<s> the brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant <\s>
<s> bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount and the competition among the brokers which is exceedingly active prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance <\s>
<s> when the united states had the same number of dollars to pay to england which england had to pay to her one set of merchants in the united states would want bills and another set would have bills to dispose of for the very same number of dollars and consequently a bill on england for 1,000 would sell for exactly 1,000 or in the phraseology of merchants the exchange would be at par <\s>
<s> as england also on this supposition would have an equal number of dollars to pay and to receive bills on the united states would be at par in england whenever bills on england were at par in the united states <\s>
<s> if however the united states had a larger sum to pay to england than to receive from her there would be persons requiring bills on england for a greater number of dollars than there were bills drawn by persons to whom money was due <\s>
<s> a bill on england for 1,000 would then sell for more than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a premium <\s>
<s> the premium however could not exceed the cost and risk of making the remittance in gold together with a trifling profit because if it did the debtor would send the gold itself in preference to buying the bill <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the united states had more money to receive from england than to pay there would be bills offered for a greater number of dollars than were wanted for remittance and the price of bills would fall below par a bill for 1,000 might be bought for somewhat less than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a discount <\s>
<s> when the united states has more to pay than to receive england has more to receive than to pay and vice versa <\s>
<s> when therefore in the united states bills on england bear a premium then in england bills on the united states are at a discount and when bills on england are at a discount in the united states bills on the united states are at a premium in england <\s>
<s> if they are at par in either country they are so as we have already seen in both 275 thus do matters stand between countries or places which have the same currency <\s>
<s> so much of barbarism however still remains in the transactions of the most civilized nations that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having to their own inconvenience and that of their neighbors a peculiar currency of their own <\s>
<s> to our present purpose this makes no other difference than that instead of speaking of equal sums of money we have to speak of equivalent sums <\s>
<s> by equivalent sums when both currencies are composed of the same metal are meant sums which contain exactly the same quantity of the metal in weight and fineness <\s>
<s> the quantity of gold in the english pound is equivalent to 4.8666+ of our gold coins <\s>
<s> if the bills offered are about equal to those wanted a claim to a pound in england will sell for 4.86 <\s>
<s> if many are wanted and but few to be had their price will go up of course but it can not go more than a small fraction beyond 4.90 since about 3  cents is sufficient to cover the brokerage insurance and freight per pound sterling in a shipment of gold to london <\s>
<s> therefore in order to get money to a creditor in london no one will pay more for a pound in the form of a bill than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form of bullion <\s>
<s> bills of exchange then can not rise in price beyond the point 4.90 since rather than pay a higher sum for a bill gold will be sent <\s>
<s> this point is called the    shipping point    of gold <\s>
<s> when the exchanges are at 4.90 it will be found that gold is going abroad <\s>
<s> on the other hand when the supply of bills is greater than the demand their price will fall <\s>
<s> a man having a bill on london to selli e a claim to a pound in londonwill not sell it at a price here lower than 4.86 by more than the expense of bringing the gold itself across <\s>
<s> since this expense is about 3  cents bills can not fall below about 4.83 <\s>
<s> when exchange is at that price it will be found that gold is coming to the united states from england <\s>
<s> this price is the    shipping point    for imports of gold <\s>
<s> this of course applies to sight bills only <\s>
<s> formerly we computed exchange on a scale of percentages the real par being about 109 <\s>
<s> this was given up after the war <\s>
<s> when bills on foreign countries are at a premium it is customary to say that the exchanges are against the country or unfavorable to it <\s>
<s> in order to understand these phrases we must take notice of what    the exchange    in the language of merchants really means <\s>
<s> it means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries <\s>
<s> supposing 4.86 to be the exact par of exchange then when it requires more than 1,000 to buy a bill of   205 1,000 of american money are worth less than their real equivalent of english money and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the united states <\s>
<s> the only persons in the united states however to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in england for they come into the bill market as buyers and have to pay a premium but to those who have money to receive in england the same state of things is favorable for they come as sellers and receive the premium <\s>
<s> the premium however indicates that a balance is due by the united states which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals and since according to the old theory the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice <\s>
<s> distinction between variations in the exchanges which are self adjusting and those which can only be rectified through prices <\s>
<s> it might be supposed at first sight that when the exchange is unfavorable or in other words when bills are at a premium the premium must always amount to a full equivalent for the cost of transmitting money <\s>
<s> but a small excess of imports above exports or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries does not usually affect the exchanges to the full extent of the cost and risk of transporting bullion <\s>
<s> the length of credit allowed generally permits on the part of some of the debtors a postponement of payment and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals <\s>
<s> and this is the more likely to happen as there is a self adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself <\s>
<s> bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported <\s>
<s> but the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export <\s>
<s> besides the price they obtain for their goods they draw for the amount and gain the premium <\s>
<s> it is on the other hand a diminution of profit to those who import <\s>
<s> besides the price of the goods they have to pay a premium for remittance <\s>
<s> so that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export and a discouragement to import <\s>
<s> and if the balance due is of small amount and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade it is soon liquidated in commodities and the account adjusted by means of bills without the transmission of any bullion <\s>
<s> not so however when the excess of imports above exports which has made the exchange unfavorable arises from a permanent cause <\s>
<s> in that case what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices and it can only be restored by acting on prices <\s>
<s> it is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills for if the exports were kept up to the imports bills would not be at a premium and the extra profit would not exist <\s>
<s> it is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered <\s>
<s> disturbances therefore of the equilibrium of imports and exports and consequent disturbances of the exchange may be considered as of two classes the one casual or accidental which if not on too large a scale correct themselves through the premium on bills without any transmission of the precious metals the other arising from the general state of prices which can not be corrected without the subtraction of actual money from the circulation of one of the countries or an annihilation of credit equivalent to it <\s>
<s> it remains to observe that the exchanges do not depend on the balance of debts and credits with each country separately but with all countries taken together <\s>
<s> the united states may owe a balance of payments to england but it does not follow that the exchange with england will be against the united states and that bills on england will be at a premium because a balance may be due to the united states from holland or hamburg and she may pay her debts to england with bills on those places which is technically called arbitration of exchange <\s>
<s> there is some little additional expense partly commission and partly loss of interest in settling debts in this circuitous manner and to the extent of that small difference the exchange with one country may vary apart from that with others <\s>
<s> a common use of bills of exchange is that by which when three countries are concerned two of them may strike a balance through the third if both countries have dealings with that third country <\s>
<s> new york merchants may buy of china but china may not be buying of new york although both may have dealings with london <\s>

<s> the nearest analogy would lead us to presume the negative <\s>
<s> we did not find that the intervention of money and its substitutes made any difference in the law of value as applied to adjacent places <\s>

<s> we shall not be surprised therefore if we find that international values also are determined by the same causes under a money and bill system as they would be under a system of barter and that money has little to do in the matter except to furnish a convenient mode of comparing values <\s>
<s> all interchange is in substance and effect barter whoever sells commodities for money and with that money buys other goods really buys those goods with his own commodities <\s>
<s> and so of nations their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports and whether money is employed or not things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> when this is the case equal sums of money are due from each country to the other the debts are settled by bills and there is no balance to be paid in the precious metals <\s>
<s> the trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium <\s>
<s> but the process by which things are brought back to this state when they happen to deviate from it is at least outwardly not the same in a barter system and in a money system <\s>
<s> under the first the country which wants more imports than its exports will pay for must offer its exports at a cheaper rate as the sole means of creating a demand for them sufficient to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when money is used the country seems to do a thing totally different <\s>
<s> she takes the additional imports at the same price as before and as she exports no equivalent the balance of payments turns against her the exchange becomes unfavorable and the difference has to be paid in money <\s>

<s> by this transmission of the precious metals the quantity of the currency is diminished in the united states and increased in england <\s>

<s> we are now supposing that there is an excess of imports over exports arising from the fact that the equation of international demand is not yet established that there is at the ordinary prices a permanent demand in the united states for more english goods than the american goods required in england at the ordinary prices will pay for <\s>

<s> in this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy <\s>

<s> this premium as it is called the buyers are willing to pay because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business <\s>

<s> the reverse of all this happens if on the comparison of exports and imports the country instead of having a balance to pay has a balance to receive <\s>
<s> the brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant <\s>
<s> bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount and the competition among the brokers which is exceedingly active prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance <\s>
<s> when the united states had the same number of dollars to pay to england which england had to pay to her one set of merchants in the united states would want bills and another set would have bills to dispose of for the very same number of dollars and consequently a bill on england for 1,000 would sell for exactly 1,000 or in the phraseology of merchants the exchange would be at par <\s>
<s> as england also on this supposition would have an equal number of dollars to pay and to receive bills on the united states would be at par in england whenever bills on england were at par in the united states <\s>
<s> if however the united states had a larger sum to pay to england than to receive from her there would be persons requiring bills on england for a greater number of dollars than there were bills drawn by persons to whom money was due <\s>
<s> a bill on england for 1,000 would then sell for more than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a premium <\s>
<s> the premium however could not exceed the cost and risk of making the remittance in gold together with a trifling profit because if it did the debtor would send the gold itself in preference to buying the bill <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the united states had more money to receive from england than to pay there would be bills offered for a greater number of dollars than were wanted for remittance and the price of bills would fall below par a bill for 1,000 might be bought for somewhat less than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a discount <\s>
<s> when the united states has more to pay than to receive england has more to receive than to pay and vice versa <\s>
<s> when therefore in the united states bills on england bear a premium then in england bills on the united states are at a discount and when bills on england are at a discount in the united states bills on the united states are at a premium in england <\s>
<s> if they are at par in either country they are so as we have already seen in both 275 thus do matters stand between countries or places which have the same currency <\s>
<s> so much of barbarism however still remains in the transactions of the most civilized nations that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having to their own inconvenience and that of their neighbors a peculiar currency of their own <\s>
<s> to our present purpose this makes no other difference than that instead of speaking of equal sums of money we have to speak of equivalent sums <\s>
<s> by equivalent sums when both currencies are composed of the same metal are meant sums which contain exactly the same quantity of the metal in weight and fineness <\s>
<s> the quantity of gold in the english pound is equivalent to 4.8666+ of our gold coins <\s>
<s> if the bills offered are about equal to those wanted a claim to a pound in england will sell for 4.86 <\s>
<s> if many are wanted and but few to be had their price will go up of course but it can not go more than a small fraction beyond 4.90 since about 3  cents is sufficient to cover the brokerage insurance and freight per pound sterling in a shipment of gold to london <\s>
<s> therefore in order to get money to a creditor in london no one will pay more for a pound in the form of a bill than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form of bullion <\s>
<s> bills of exchange then can not rise in price beyond the point 4.90 since rather than pay a higher sum for a bill gold will be sent <\s>
<s> this point is called the    shipping point    of gold <\s>
<s> when the exchanges are at 4.90 it will be found that gold is going abroad <\s>
<s> on the other hand when the supply of bills is greater than the demand their price will fall <\s>
<s> a man having a bill on london to selli e a claim to a pound in londonwill not sell it at a price here lower than 4.86 by more than the expense of bringing the gold itself across <\s>
<s> since this expense is about 3  cents bills can not fall below about 4.83 <\s>
<s> when exchange is at that price it will be found that gold is coming to the united states from england <\s>
<s> this price is the    shipping point    for imports of gold <\s>
<s> this of course applies to sight bills only <\s>
<s> formerly we computed exchange on a scale of percentages the real par being about 109 <\s>
<s> this was given up after the war <\s>
<s> when bills on foreign countries are at a premium it is customary to say that the exchanges are against the country or unfavorable to it <\s>
<s> in order to understand these phrases we must take notice of what    the exchange    in the language of merchants really means <\s>
<s> it means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries <\s>
<s> supposing 4.86 to be the exact par of exchange then when it requires more than 1,000 to buy a bill of   205 1,000 of american money are worth less than their real equivalent of english money and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the united states <\s>
<s> the only persons in the united states however to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in england for they come into the bill market as buyers and have to pay a premium but to those who have money to receive in england the same state of things is favorable for they come as sellers and receive the premium <\s>
<s> the premium however indicates that a balance is due by the united states which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals and since according to the old theory the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice <\s>
<s> distinction between variations in the exchanges which are self adjusting and those which can only be rectified through prices <\s>
<s> it might be supposed at first sight that when the exchange is unfavorable or in other words when bills are at a premium the premium must always amount to a full equivalent for the cost of transmitting money <\s>
<s> but a small excess of imports above exports or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries does not usually affect the exchanges to the full extent of the cost and risk of transporting bullion <\s>
<s> the length of credit allowed generally permits on the part of some of the debtors a postponement of payment and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals <\s>
<s> and this is the more likely to happen as there is a self adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself <\s>
<s> bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported <\s>
<s> but the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export <\s>
<s> besides the price they obtain for their goods they draw for the amount and gain the premium <\s>
<s> it is on the other hand a diminution of profit to those who import <\s>
<s> besides the price of the goods they have to pay a premium for remittance <\s>
<s> so that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export and a discouragement to import <\s>
<s> and if the balance due is of small amount and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade it is soon liquidated in commodities and the account adjusted by means of bills without the transmission of any bullion <\s>
<s> not so however when the excess of imports above exports which has made the exchange unfavorable arises from a permanent cause <\s>
<s> in that case what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices and it can only be restored by acting on prices <\s>
<s> it is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills for if the exports were kept up to the imports bills would not be at a premium and the extra profit would not exist <\s>
<s> it is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered <\s>
<s> disturbances therefore of the equilibrium of imports and exports and consequent disturbances of the exchange may be considered as of two classes the one casual or accidental which if not on too large a scale correct themselves through the premium on bills without any transmission of the precious metals the other arising from the general state of prices which can not be corrected without the subtraction of actual money from the circulation of one of the countries or an annihilation of credit equivalent to it <\s>
<s> it remains to observe that the exchanges do not depend on the balance of debts and credits with each country separately but with all countries taken together <\s>
<s> the united states may owe a balance of payments to england but it does not follow that the exchange with england will be against the united states and that bills on england will be at a premium because a balance may be due to the united states from holland or hamburg and she may pay her debts to england with bills on those places which is technically called arbitration of exchange <\s>
<s> there is some little additional expense partly commission and partly loss of interest in settling debts in this circuitous manner and to the extent of that small difference the exchange with one country may vary apart from that with others <\s>
<s> a common use of bills of exchange is that by which when three countries are concerned two of them may strike a balance through the third if both countries have dealings with that third country <\s>
<s> new york merchants may buy of china but china may not be buying of new york although both may have dealings with london <\s>

<s> the nearest analogy would lead us to presume the negative <\s>
<s> we did not find that the intervention of money and its substitutes made any difference in the law of value as applied to adjacent places <\s>

<s> we shall not be surprised therefore if we find that international values also are determined by the same causes under a money and bill system as they would be under a system of barter and that money has little to do in the matter except to furnish a convenient mode of comparing values <\s>
<s> all interchange is in substance and effect barter whoever sells commodities for money and with that money buys other goods really buys those goods with his own commodities <\s>
<s> and so of nations their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports and whether money is employed or not things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> when this is the case equal sums of money are due from each country to the other the debts are settled by bills and there is no balance to be paid in the precious metals <\s>
<s> the trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium <\s>
<s> but the process by which things are brought back to this state when they happen to deviate from it is at least outwardly not the same in a barter system and in a money system <\s>
<s> under the first the country which wants more imports than its exports will pay for must offer its exports at a cheaper rate as the sole means of creating a demand for them sufficient to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when money is used the country seems to do a thing totally different <\s>
<s> she takes the additional imports at the same price as before and as she exports no equivalent the balance of payments turns against her the exchange becomes unfavorable and the difference has to be paid in money <\s>

<s> by this transmission of the precious metals the quantity of the currency is diminished in the united states and increased in england <\s>

<s> we are now supposing that there is an excess of imports over exports arising from the fact that the equation of international demand is not yet established that there is at the ordinary prices a permanent demand in the united states for more english goods than the american goods required in england at the ordinary prices will pay for <\s>

<s> in this as in other branches of business there is a class of middle men or brokers who bring buyers and sellers together or stand between them buying bills from those who have money to receive and selling bills to those who have money to pay <\s>

<s> in this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy <\s>
<s> now if the brokers find that they are asked for bills on the one part to a greater amount than bills are offered to them on the other they do not on this account refuse to give them but since in that case they have no means of enabling the correspondents on whom their bills are drawn to pay them when due except by transmitting part of the amount in gold or silver they require from those to whom they sell bills an additional price sufficient to cover the freight and insurance of the gold and silver with a profit sufficient to compensate them for their trouble and for the temporary occupation of a portion of their capital <\s>
<s> this premium as it is called the buyers are willing to pay because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business <\s>
<s> but though only some of those who have a debt to pay would have actually to remit money all will be obliged by each others competition to pay the premium and the brokers are for the same reason obliged to pay it to those whose bills they buy <\s>
<s> the reverse of all this happens if on the comparison of exports and imports the country instead of having a balance to pay has a balance to receive <\s>
<s> the brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant <\s>
<s> bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount and the competition among the brokers which is exceedingly active prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance <\s>
<s> when the united states had the same number of dollars to pay to england which england had to pay to her one set of merchants in the united states would want bills and another set would have bills to dispose of for the very same number of dollars and consequently a bill on england for 1,000 would sell for exactly 1,000 or in the phraseology of merchants the exchange would be at par <\s>
<s> as england also on this supposition would have an equal number of dollars to pay and to receive bills on the united states would be at par in england whenever bills on england were at par in the united states <\s>
<s> if however the united states had a larger sum to pay to england than to receive from her there would be persons requiring bills on england for a greater number of dollars than there were bills drawn by persons to whom money was due <\s>
<s> a bill on england for 1,000 would then sell for more than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a premium <\s>
<s> the premium however could not exceed the cost and risk of making the remittance in gold together with a trifling profit because if it did the debtor would send the gold itself in preference to buying the bill <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the united states had more money to receive from england than to pay there would be bills offered for a greater number of dollars than were wanted for remittance and the price of bills would fall below par a bill for 1,000 might be bought for somewhat less than 1,000 and bills would be said to be at a discount <\s>
<s> when the united states has more to pay than to receive england has more to receive than to pay and vice versa <\s>
<s> when therefore in the united states bills on england bear a premium then in england bills on the united states are at a discount and when bills on england are at a discount in the united states bills on the united states are at a premium in england <\s>
<s> if they are at par in either country they are so as we have already seen in both 275 thus do matters stand between countries or places which have the same currency <\s>
<s> so much of barbarism however still remains in the transactions of the most civilized nations that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having to their own inconvenience and that of their neighbors a peculiar currency of their own <\s>
<s> to our present purpose this makes no other difference than that instead of speaking of equal sums of money we have to speak of equivalent sums <\s>
<s> by equivalent sums when both currencies are composed of the same metal are meant sums which contain exactly the same quantity of the metal in weight and fineness <\s>
<s> the quantity of gold in the english pound is equivalent to 4.8666+ of our gold coins <\s>
<s> if the bills offered are about equal to those wanted a claim to a pound in england will sell for 4.86 <\s>
<s> if many are wanted and but few to be had their price will go up of course but it can not go more than a small fraction beyond 4.90 since about 3  cents is sufficient to cover the brokerage insurance and freight per pound sterling in a shipment of gold to london <\s>
<s> therefore in order to get money to a creditor in london no one will pay more for a pound in the form of a bill than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form of bullion <\s>
<s> bills of exchange then can not rise in price beyond the point 4.90 since rather than pay a higher sum for a bill gold will be sent <\s>
<s> this point is called the    shipping point    of gold <\s>
<s> when the exchanges are at 4.90 it will be found that gold is going abroad <\s>
<s> on the other hand when the supply of bills is greater than the demand their price will fall <\s>
<s> a man having a bill on london to selli e a claim to a pound in londonwill not sell it at a price here lower than 4.86 by more than the expense of bringing the gold itself across <\s>
<s> since this expense is about 3  cents bills can not fall below about 4.83 <\s>
<s> when exchange is at that price it will be found that gold is coming to the united states from england <\s>
<s> this price is the    shipping point    for imports of gold <\s>
<s> this of course applies to sight bills only <\s>
<s> formerly we computed exchange on a scale of percentages the real par being about 109 <\s>
<s> this was given up after the war <\s>
<s> when bills on foreign countries are at a premium it is customary to say that the exchanges are against the country or unfavorable to it <\s>
<s> in order to understand these phrases we must take notice of what    the exchange    in the language of merchants really means <\s>
<s> it means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries <\s>
<s> supposing 4.86 to be the exact par of exchange then when it requires more than 1,000 to buy a bill of   205 1,000 of american money are worth less than their real equivalent of english money and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the united states <\s>
<s> the only persons in the united states however to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in england for they come into the bill market as buyers and have to pay a premium but to those who have money to receive in england the same state of things is favorable for they come as sellers and receive the premium <\s>
<s> the premium however indicates that a balance is due by the united states which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals and since according to the old theory the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice <\s>
<s> distinction between variations in the exchanges which are self adjusting and those which can only be rectified through prices <\s>
<s> it might be supposed at first sight that when the exchange is unfavorable or in other words when bills are at a premium the premium must always amount to a full equivalent for the cost of transmitting money <\s>
<s> but a small excess of imports above exports or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries does not usually affect the exchanges to the full extent of the cost and risk of transporting bullion <\s>
<s> the length of credit allowed generally permits on the part of some of the debtors a postponement of payment and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals <\s>
<s> and this is the more likely to happen as there is a self adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself <\s>
<s> bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported <\s>
<s> but the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export <\s>
<s> besides the price they obtain for their goods they draw for the amount and gain the premium <\s>
<s> it is on the other hand a diminution of profit to those who import <\s>
<s> besides the price of the goods they have to pay a premium for remittance <\s>
<s> so that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export and a discouragement to import <\s>
<s> and if the balance due is of small amount and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade it is soon liquidated in commodities and the account adjusted by means of bills without the transmission of any bullion <\s>
<s> not so however when the excess of imports above exports which has made the exchange unfavorable arises from a permanent cause <\s>
<s> in that case what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices and it can only be restored by acting on prices <\s>
<s> it is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills for if the exports were kept up to the imports bills would not be at a premium and the extra profit would not exist <\s>
<s> it is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered <\s>
<s> disturbances therefore of the equilibrium of imports and exports and consequent disturbances of the exchange may be considered as of two classes the one casual or accidental which if not on too large a scale correct themselves through the premium on bills without any transmission of the precious metals the other arising from the general state of prices which can not be corrected without the subtraction of actual money from the circulation of one of the countries or an annihilation of credit equivalent to it <\s>
<s> it remains to observe that the exchanges do not depend on the balance of debts and credits with each country separately but with all countries taken together <\s>
<s> the united states may owe a balance of payments to england but it does not follow that the exchange with england will be against the united states and that bills on england will be at a premium because a balance may be due to the united states from holland or hamburg and she may pay her debts to england with bills on those places which is technically called arbitration of exchange <\s>
<s> there is some little additional expense partly commission and partly loss of interest in settling debts in this circuitous manner and to the extent of that small difference the exchange with one country may vary apart from that with others <\s>
<s> a common use of bills of exchange is that by which when three countries are concerned two of them may strike a balance through the third if both countries have dealings with that third country <\s>
<s> new york merchants may buy of china but china may not be buying of new york although both may have dealings with london <\s>

<s> the nearest analogy would lead us to presume the negative <\s>
<s> we did not find that the intervention of money and its substitutes made any difference in the law of value as applied to adjacent places <\s>

<s> all interchange is in substance and effect barter whoever sells commodities for money and with that money buys other goods really buys those goods with his own commodities <\s>
<s> and so of nations their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports and whether money is employed or not things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other <\s>
<s> when this is the case equal sums of money are due from each country to the other the debts are settled by bills and there is no balance to be paid in the precious metals <\s>
<s> the trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium <\s>
<s> but the process by which things are brought back to this state when they happen to deviate from it is at least outwardly not the same in a barter system and in a money system <\s>
<s> under the first the country which wants more imports than its exports will pay for must offer its exports at a cheaper rate as the sole means of creating a demand for them sufficient to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when money is used the country seems to do a thing totally different <\s>
<s> she takes the additional imports at the same price as before and as she exports no equivalent the balance of payments turns against her the exchange becomes unfavorable and the difference has to be paid in money <\s>

<s> by this transmission of the precious metals the quantity of the currency is diminished in the united states and increased in england <\s>

<s> we are now supposing that there is an excess of imports over exports arising from the fact that the equation of international demand is not yet established that there is at the ordinary prices a permanent demand in the united states for more english goods than the american goods required in england at the ordinary prices will pay for <\s>
