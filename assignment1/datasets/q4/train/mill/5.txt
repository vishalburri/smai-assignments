<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>

<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>

<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>

<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>

<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>

<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>

<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>

<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>

<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>

<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>

<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>

<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>

<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>

<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>

<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>

<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>

<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>

<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>

<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>

<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>

<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>

<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>

<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>

<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>

<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>

<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>

<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>

<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>

<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>

<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>

<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>

<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>

<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>

<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>

<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>

<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>

<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>

<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>

<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>

<s> writers on political economy profess to teach or to investigate the nature of wealth and the laws of its production and distribution including directly or remotely the operation of all the causes by which the condition of mankind or of any society of human beings in respect to this universal object of human desire is made prosperous or the reverse <\s>
<s> it will be noticed that political economy does not include ethics legislation or the science of government <\s>
<s> the results of political economy are offered to the statesman who reaches a conclusion after weighing them in connection with moral and political considerations <\s>
<s> political economy is distinct from sociology although it is common to include in the former everything which concerns social life <\s>
<s> some writers distinguish between the pure or abstract science and the applied art and we can speak of a science of political economy only in the sense of a body of abstract laws or formulas <\s>
<s> this however does not make political economy less practical than physics for after a principle is ascertained its operation is to be observed in the same way that we study the force of gravitation in a falling stone even when retarded by opposing forces <\s>
<s> an economic force or tendency can be likewise distinctly observed although other influences working at the same time prevent the expected effect from following its cause <\s>
<s> it is in short the aim of political economy to investigate the laws which govern the phenomena of material wealth <\s>

<s> iii while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it <\s>
<s> according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth <\s>
<s> more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life 100 whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it <\s>
<s> if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money <\s>
<s> any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade <\s>
<s> exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver <\s>
<s> importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be re exported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation <\s>
<s> the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it <\s>
<s> the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things <\s>
<s> money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him <\s>
<s> the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smiths illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves <\s>
<s> money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also <\s>
<s> to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them <\s>
<s> everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange <\s>
<s> things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy <\s>
<s> air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy <\s>
<s> it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth <\s>
<s> if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in diving bells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value <\s>
<s> in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them <\s>
<s> the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment <\s>
<s> wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice <\s>
<s> this is the usual definition of wealth <\s>

<s> carey    social science    i 186 asserts that wealth consists in the power to command natures services including in wealth such intangible things as mental qualities <\s>
<s> of the requisites of production <\s>
<s> the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects <\s>
<s> there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58 <\s>
<s> since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary that is so soon as production requires such a term that during the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production <\s>
<s> this takes place also under any general division of labor in a community <\s>
<s> when one man is making a pin head he must be supplied with food by some person until the pins are finished and exchanged <\s>
<s> labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of ones thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation <\s>
<s> the word    sacrifice    conveys a just idea of what the laborer undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist <\s>
<s> of the other requisiteappropriate natural objectsit is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants <\s>
<s> there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them <\s>
<s> of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity <\s>
<s> by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it <\s>
<s> land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come <\s>
<s> but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use <\s>
<s> in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity <\s>
<s> coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land <\s>
<s> for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis <\s>
<s> but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operativeas soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for askingthe ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value <\s>
<s> rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had practically for the asking but now since railways and an increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets they have acquired a distinct exchange value <\s>
<s> the value of a commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things for which it can be exchanged <\s>
