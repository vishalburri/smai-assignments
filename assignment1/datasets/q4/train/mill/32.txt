<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>

<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>

<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>

<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>

<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>

<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>

<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>

<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>

<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>

<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>

<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>

<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>

<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>

<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>

<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>

<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>

<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>

<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>

<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>

<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>

<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>

<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>

<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>

<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>

<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>

<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>

<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>

<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>

<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>

<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>

<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>

<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>

<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>

<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>

<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>

<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>

<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>

<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>

<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>

<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>

<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>

<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>

<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
<s> for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and money lending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people <\s>
<s> a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest <\s>
<s> of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue notes on their simple credit <\s>
<s> that privilege has been so often abused in this country that now in the national banking system a separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england since 1844 <\s>
<s> it is not generally true then that banks now create the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow capital from the community without paying interest <\s>
<s> they do however depend almost entirely on deposits <\s>
<s> a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little <\s>
<s> having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital <\s>
<s> the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another 286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment <\s>
<s> the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the fluctuations <\s>
<s> fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply <\s>
<s> the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand <\s>
<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>

<s> the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows <\s>
<s> in speculative times money lenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them <\s>
<s> accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes <\s>
<s> during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend 287 this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic <\s>
<s> it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the non mercantile public a general distrust in each others solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given <\s>
<s> deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills <\s>
<s> at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken <\s>
<s> persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice <\s>
<s> the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal <\s>
<s> when it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on credituntil the proceeds of goods sold on credit are collectedthe rate of interest from day to day is very important to trade <\s>
<s> so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save the borrower from commercial ruin <\s>
<s> the effect of a legal rate is to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to the business public <\s>
<s> it would be far better to adopt such a sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the rate of interest to rise with the demand <\s>
<s> no one then with good security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates and those not really in need will defer their demand until the sudden emergency is past <\s>
<s> already in new york the legal penalty has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when charged upon call loans and it has mitigated the extreme fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is contending against the law <\s>
<s> except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return <\s>
<s> the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations <\s>
<s> a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market <\s>
<s> the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies <\s>
<s> the united states during the late war found that it could not borrow at even six or seven per cent <\s>
<s> by receiving depreciated paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was equivalent to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> this high rate was largely due to the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true that the rate was higher because the united states was in the market as a competitor for large loans <\s>
<s> now the government can refund its bonds at three per cent <\s>
<s> nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states 137,823 253 in 1882 1883 and more than 100,000 000 in 1883 1884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in the market <\s>
<s> without doubt this aids in making the present rate of interest a very low one <\s>
<s> whether the rate will remain    permanently lower    however will depend upon whether the field of investment in the united states is already practically occupied <\s>
<s> we believe it is not <\s>
<s> the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment <\s>
<s> the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways <\s>
<s> this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase money in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund <\s>
<s> it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business <\s>
<s> the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it <\s>
<s> from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation <\s>
<s> an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever <\s>
<s> it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money <\s>
<s> if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two <\s>
<s> unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value <\s>
<s> in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues <\s>
<s> tooke    supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors    in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around the functions of discount and deposit <\s>
<s> the separation of the issue from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear <\s>
<s> after entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as before which shows that the real question is concerned with the two essential functions of bankingdiscount and deposit <\s>
<s> since 1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857 1866 and 1873 <\s>
<s> although no expansion of notes without a corresponding deposit of specie is possible <\s>
<s> the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities <\s>
<s> before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding <\s>
<s> the public funds shares in joint stock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low <\s>
<s> they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchase money with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience <\s>
<s> the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest <\s>
<s> land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession <\s>
<s> but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows c  teris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap <\s>
<s> a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of 100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would sell for 1,000 <\s>
<s> if the return from the land remains the same 100 to day and if the usual rate of interest is now five per cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2,000 since 100 is five per cent of 2,000 <\s>
<s> the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it has to run <\s>
<s> at the same rate of interest a bond running for a long term of years is better for an investment than one for a short term <\s>
<s> the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according to the height of the tree <\s>
<s> then again a bond running for a short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though the first bears a higher rate of interest <\s>
<s> that is to resume the illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much higher up into the air <\s>
<s> of the competition of different countries in the same market <\s>
<s> causes which enable one country to undersell another <\s>
<s> in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling <\s>
<s> to undersell other countriesnot to be undersold by other countrieswere spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist <\s>
<s> nations may like individual dealers be competitors with opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal customers <\s>
<s> the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater cost <\s>
<s> one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her as relation with the customer country in respect to the demand for each others products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customer country more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b ); otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market <\s>
<s> let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in iron and wheat <\s>
<s> england being capable of producing ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen <\s>
<s> the united states could not be permanently undersold in the english market and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty bushels of wheat for ten cwts <\s>
<s> short of that the competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat <\s>
<s> the country therefore which could undersell the united states must in the first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with iron than the united states herself and in the next place must have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the market to give a greater advantage to england than the united states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for example twenty one bushels for ten cwts <\s>
<s> for if notif for example the equation of international demand after the united states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for tenthe united states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand <\s>
<s> in like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts <\s>
<s> of iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> in that case england could no longer carry on the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less wheat than she had previously given 288 it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article <\s>
<s> it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states <\s>
<s> suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals <\s>
<s> the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the business world would regard what was going on under economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that prices were to fall and gold leave the country <\s>
<s> those holding large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at first it might really happen that    exporters    in the sense of exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable article would incur a loss <\s>
<s> in the end of course the consumers of imports suffer <\s>
<s> but temporarily and on the face of it exporters do lose <\s>
<s> high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another <\s>
<s> according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customersa greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world <\s>
<s> the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it <\s>
