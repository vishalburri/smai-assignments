<s> but in no country of any extent do the wants of the population require that all the land which is capable of cultivation should be cultivated <\s>

<s> whether any given land is capable of doing more than this is not a question of political economy but of physical fact <\s>

<s> 2 the worst land which can be cultivated as an investment for capital is that which after replacing the seed not only feeds the agricultural laborers and their secondaries but affords them the current rate of wages which may extend to much more than mere necessaries and leaves for those who have advanced the wages of these two classes of laborers a surplus equal to the profit they could have expected from any other employment of their capital <\s>
<s> 3 whether any given land can do more than this is not merely a physical question but depends partly on the market value of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> what the land can do for the laborers and for the capitalist beyond feeding all whom it directly or indirectly employs of course depends upon what the remainder of the produce can be sold for <\s>
<s> the higher the market value of produce the lower are the soils to which cultivation can descend consistently with affording to the capital employed the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> as however differences of fertility slide into one another by insensible gradations and differences of accessibility that is of distance from markets do the same and since there is land so barren that it could not pay for its cultivation at any price it is evident that whatever the price may be there must in any extensive region be some land which at that price will just pay the wages of the cultivators and yield to the capital employed the ordinary profit and no more <\s>
<s> until therefore the price rises higher or until some improvement raises that particular land to a higher place in the scale of fertility it can not pay any rent <\s>

<s> the rent of land is the excess of its return above the return to the worst land in cultivation <\s>

<s> the surplus is what the farmer can afford to pay as rent to the landlord and since if he did not so pay it he would receive more than the ordinary rate of profit the competition of other capitalists that competition which equalizes the profits of different capitals will enable the landlord to appropriate it <\s>
<s> the rent therefore which any land will yield is the excess of its produce beyond what would be returned to the same capital if employed on the worst land in cultivation <\s>
<s> it has been denied that there can be any land in cultivation which pays no rent because landlords it is contended would not allow their land to be occupied without payment <\s>
<s> inferior land however does not usually occupy without interruption many square miles of ground it is dispersed here and there with patches of better land intermixed and the same person who rents the better land obtains along with it the inferior soils which alternate with it <\s>
<s> he pays a rent nominally for the whole farm but calculated on the produce of those parts alone however small a portion of the whole which are capable of returning more than the common rate of profit <\s>
<s> it is thus scientifically true that the remaining parts pay no rent <\s>
<s> this point seems to need some illustration <\s>
<s> suppose that all the lands in a community are of five different grades of productiveness <\s>
<s> when the price of agricultural produce was such that grades one two and three all came into cultivation lands of poorer quality would not be cultivated <\s>
<s> when a man rents a farm he always gets land of varying degrees of fertility within its limits <\s>
<s> now in determining what he ought to pay as rent the farmer will agree to give that which will still leave him a profit on his working capital if in his fields he finds land which would not enter into the question of rental because it did not yield more than the profit on working it after he rented the farm he would find it to his interest to cultivate it simply because it yielded him a profit and because he was not obliged to pay rent upon it if required to pay rent for it he would lose the ordinary rate of profit would have no reason for cultivating it of course and would throw it out of cultivation <\s>

<s>    agricultural rent as it actually exists    says mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 180 truly    is not a consequence of the monopoly of the soil but of its diminishing productiveness    the doctrine of rent depends upon the law of diminishing returns and it is only by the pressure of population upon land that the lessened productiveness of land whether because of poorer qualities or poorer situations is made apparent <\s>
<s> or to take things in their natural sequence an increase of population necessitates more food and this implies a resort to more expensive methods or poorer soils so soon as land is pushed to the extent that it will not yield an increased crop for the same application of labor and capital as formerly <\s>
<s> different qualities of land then being in cultivation at the same time the better qualities must of course yield a greater return than the poorer and the conditions then exist under which land pays rent <\s>
<s> those therefore who admit the law of diminishing returns are inevitably led to the doctrine of rent <\s>

<s> if the whole land of a country were required for cultivation all of it might yield a rent <\s>
<s> but in no country of any extent do the wants of the population require that all the land which is capable of cultivation should be cultivated <\s>
<s> the food and other agricultural produce which the people need and which they are willing and able to pay for at a price which remunerates the grower may always be obtained without cultivating all the land sometimes without cultivating more than a small part of it the more fertile lands or those in the more convenient situations being of course preferred <\s>
<s> there is always therefore some land which can not in existing circumstances pay any rent and no land ever pays rent unless in point of fertility or situation it belongs to those superior kinds which exist in less quantity than the demandwhich can not be made to yield all the produce required for the community unless on terms still less advantageous than the resort to less favored soils <\s>
<s> 1 the worst land which can be cultivated as a means of subsistence is that which will just replace the seed and the food of the laborers employed on it together with what dr <\s>
<s> chalmers calls their secondaries that is the laborers required for supplying them with tools and with the remaining necessaries of life <\s>
<s> whether any given land is capable of doing more than this is not a question of political economy but of physical fact <\s>
<s> the supposition leaves nothing for profits nor anything for the laborers except necessaries the land therefore can only be cultivated by the laborers themselves or else at a pecuniary loss and a fortiori can not in any contingency afford a rent <\s>
<s> 2 the worst land which can be cultivated as an investment for capital is that which after replacing the seed not only feeds the agricultural laborers and their secondaries but affords them the current rate of wages which may extend to much more than mere necessaries and leaves for those who have advanced the wages of these two classes of laborers a surplus equal to the profit they could have expected from any other employment of their capital <\s>
<s> 3 whether any given land can do more than this is not merely a physical question but depends partly on the market value of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> what the land can do for the laborers and for the capitalist beyond feeding all whom it directly or indirectly employs of course depends upon what the remainder of the produce can be sold for <\s>
<s> the higher the market value of produce the lower are the soils to which cultivation can descend consistently with affording to the capital employed the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> as however differences of fertility slide into one another by insensible gradations and differences of accessibility that is of distance from markets do the same and since there is land so barren that it could not pay for its cultivation at any price it is evident that whatever the price may be there must in any extensive region be some land which at that price will just pay the wages of the cultivators and yield to the capital employed the ordinary profit and no more <\s>
<s> until therefore the price rises higher or until some improvement raises that particular land to a higher place in the scale of fertility it can not pay any rent <\s>

<s> instead of weaving cloth by hand as was done a hundred years ago    one operative in lowell working one year can produce the cotton fabric needed for the years supply of 1,500 to 1,800 chinese    moreover there is no question as to the fact that no nation in the world compares with ours in the power to invent construct and manage the most ingenious and complicated machinery <\s>
<s> the inventive faculty belongs to every class in our country and in studying cost of labor it must be well borne in mind that the efficiency of american labor particularly as combined with mechanical appliances is one of the great causes of our enormous production <\s>
<s> the result of this for instance has been that without lowering profits although the price of cloth has been greatly reduced employers have been able to raise the wages of operatives and shorten their hours of labor because machinery has so vastly increased the production for a given outlay <\s>
<s> as one of a few facts showing this tendency in the last fifty years note the following table taken from the books of the namquit cotton mill in bristol rhode island kind of labor <\s>

<s> when a man rents a farm he always gets land of varying degrees of fertility within its limits <\s>
<s> now in determining what he ought to pay as rent the farmer will agree to give that which will still leave him a profit on his working capital if in his fields he finds land which would not enter into the question of rental because it did not yield more than the profit on working it after he rented the farm he would find it to his interest to cultivate it simply because it yielded him a profit and because he was not obliged to pay rent upon it if required to pay rent for it he would lose the ordinary rate of profit would have no reason for cultivating it of course and would throw it out of cultivation <\s>
