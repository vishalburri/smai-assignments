<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>
<s> the famous poor laws of elizabeth enacted in 1601 were at first intended to relieve the destitute poor sick aged and impotent but in their administration a share was given to all who begged it <\s>
<s> employers of course found it cheaper to hire labor partly paid for by the parish and the independent farm laborer who would not go on the parish found his own wages lowered by this kind of competition <\s>
<s> this continued a crying evil until it reached the proportions described by may    as the cost of pauperism thus encouraged was increasing the poorer rate payers were themselves reduced to poverty <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>

<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough <\s>
<s> all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist <\s>
<s> in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling <\s>
<s> while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining <\s>
<s> but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory <\s>
<s> very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions <\s>
<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>

<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>

<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough <\s>
<s> all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist <\s>
<s> in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling <\s>
<s> while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining <\s>
<s> but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory <\s>
<s> very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions <\s>
<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>

<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>

<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough <\s>
<s> all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist <\s>
<s> in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling <\s>
<s> while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining <\s>
<s> but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory <\s>
<s> very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions <\s>
<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>

<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>

<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough <\s>
<s> all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist <\s>
<s> in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling <\s>
<s> while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining <\s>
<s> but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory <\s>
<s> very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions <\s>
<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>

<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>

<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough <\s>
<s> all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist <\s>
<s> in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling <\s>
<s> while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining <\s>
<s> but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory <\s>
<s> very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions <\s>
<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>

<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>

<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>

<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>

<s> in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough <\s>
<s> all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist <\s>
<s> in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling <\s>
<s> while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining <\s>
<s> but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory <\s>
<s> very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions <\s>
<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>

<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>

<s> either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied <\s>
<s> though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened <\s>
<s> except therefore in the very peculiar cases which i have just noticed of which the only one of any practical importance is that of a new colony or a country in circumstances equivalent to it it is impossible that population should increase at its utmost rate without lowering wages <\s>
<s> in no old country does population increase at anything like its utmost rate in most at a very moderate rate in some countries not at all <\s>
<s> these facts are only to be accounted for in two ways <\s>
<s> either the whole number of births which nature admits of and which happen in some circumstances do not take place or if they do a large proportion of those who are born die <\s>
<s> the retardation of increase results either from mortality or prudence from mr <\s>
<s> malthuss positive or from his preventive check and one or the other of these must and does exist and very powerfully too in all old societies <\s>
<s> wherever population is not kept down by the prudence either of individuals or of the state it is kept down by starvation or disease <\s>
<s> due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboring class <\s>
<s> where a laboring class who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from over rapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry <\s>
<s> it is not generally known in how many countries of europe direct legal obstacles are opposed to improvident marriages <\s>
<s> where there is no general law restrictive of marriage there are often customs equivalent to it <\s>
<s> when the guilds or trade corporations of the middle ages were in vigor their by laws or regulations were conceived with a very vigilant eye to the advantage which the trade derived from limiting competition and they made it very effectually the interest of artisans not to marry until after passing through the two stages of apprentice and journeyman and attaining the rank of master <\s>
<s> unhappily sentimentality rather than common sense usually presides over the discussions of these subjects <\s>
<s> discussions on the condition of the laborers lamentations over its wretchedness denunciations of all who are supposed to be indifferent to it projects of one kind or another for improving it were in no country and in no time of the world so rife as in the present generation but there is a tacit agreement to ignore totally the law of wages or to dismiss it in a parenthesis with such terms as    hard hearted malthusianism    as if it were not a thousand times more hard hearted to tell human beings that they may than that they may not call into existence swarms of creatures who are sure to be miserable and most likely to be depraved <\s>
<s> i ask then is it true or not that if their numbers were fewer they would obtain higher wages <\s>
<s> this is the question and no other and it is idle to divert attention from it by attacking any incidental position of malthus or some other writer and pretending that to refute that is to disprove the principle of population <\s>
<s> some for instance have achieved an easy victory over a passing remark of mr <\s>
<s> malthus hazarded chiefly by way of illustration that the increase of food may perhaps be assumed to take place in an arithmetical ratio while population increases in a geometrical when every candid reader knows that mr <\s>
<s> malthus laid no stress on this unlucky attempt to give numerical precision to things which do not admit of it and every person capable of reasoning must see that it is wholly superfluous to his argument <\s>
<s> others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr <\s>
<s> several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence <\s>
<s> but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater <\s>
<s> under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence 171 the word tendency 172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence <\s>
<s> of remedies for low wages <\s>
<s> a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment <\s>
<s> the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers <\s>
<s> no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition <\s>
<s> another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france    conseils de prudhommes    and other names consisting of delegates from the work people and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits <\s>
<s> the one expedient most suggested by politicians and labor reformers in the united states is an eight hour law mandatory upon all employers <\s>
<s> it is to be remembered however that in very many industries piece work exists and if a diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a day <\s>
<s> even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor <\s>
<s> this would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many industries where as now the profits are very low <\s>
<s> it must be recalled however that in the united states there has been under the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase of wages <\s>
<s> for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the carding room of the cotton mills worked fourteen hours a day for 3.28 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive 5.40 a week <\s>
<s> this result is most probably due to the gain arising from the invention of labor saving machinery <\s>
<s> others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboring classes than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral <\s>
<s> every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public <\s>
<s> this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject <\s>
<s> i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be <\s>
<s> i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition <\s>
<s> this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers <\s>
<s> for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages <\s>
<s> it is equally the means by which they are kept up <\s>
<s> when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower <\s>
<s> there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition <\s>
<s> some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum <\s>
<s> nothing can be more unfounded <\s>
<s> goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages fund <\s>
<s> if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a counter competition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise <\s>
<s> the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free an operation of competition that equality of payment always exists <\s>
<s> in reality there is no competition at all between the lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor <\s>
<s> of course the tendency is as explained by mr <\s>
<s> mill and as time goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible <\s>
<s> vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe to the united states or from england to australia urged by the desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages <\s>
<s> since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wages fund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages fundby a compulsory saving <\s>
<s> it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it <\s>
<s> this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages <\s>
<s> popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor <\s>
<s> if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at    reasonable wages    it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money <\s>
<s> the proportion between labor and the wages fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital <\s>
<s>    would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population <\s>
<s> if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself <\s>
<s> society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost <\s>
<s> since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence <\s>
<s> but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence <\s>
<s> such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides <\s>
<s> but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass <\s>
<s> it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born <\s>
<s> but if it does this it is bound in self protection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent <\s>
<s> to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object <\s>
<s> but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own self restraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state <\s>
<s> the famous poor laws of elizabeth enacted in 1601 were at first intended to relieve the destitute poor sick aged and impotent but in their administration a share was given to all who begged it <\s>
<s> employers of course found it cheaper to hire labor partly paid for by the parish and the independent farm laborer who would not go on the parish found his own wages lowered by this kind of competition <\s>
<s> this continued a crying evil until it reached the proportions described by may    as the cost of pauperism thus encouraged was increasing the poorer rate payers were themselves reduced to poverty <\s>
