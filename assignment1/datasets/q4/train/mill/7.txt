<s> there is a great difference between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital on the amount of the gross produce of the country <\s>

<s> this is plausible but as was shown in the last chapter involves a fallacy demand for commodities being a totally different thing from demand for labor <\s>
<s> it is true the consumers have now additional means of buying other things but this will not create the other things unless there is capital to produce them and the improvement has not set at liberty any capital even if it has not absorbed some from other employments <\s>

<s> there is a great difference between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital on the amount of the gross produce of the country <\s>

<s> this is plausible but as was shown in the last chapter involves a fallacy demand for commodities being a totally different thing from demand for labor <\s>
<s> it is true the consumers have now additional means of buying other things but this will not create the other things unless there is capital to produce them and the improvement has not set at liberty any capital even if it has not absorbed some from other employments <\s>

<s> there is a great difference between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital on the amount of the gross produce of the country <\s>

<s> this is plausible but as was shown in the last chapter involves a fallacy demand for commodities being a totally different thing from demand for labor <\s>
<s> it is true the consumers have now additional means of buying other things but this will not create the other things unless there is capital to produce them and the improvement has not set at liberty any capital even if it has not absorbed some from other employments <\s>

<s> there is a great difference between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital on the amount of the gross produce of the country <\s>

<s> this is plausible but as was shown in the last chapter involves a fallacy demand for commodities being a totally different thing from demand for labor <\s>
<s> it is true the consumers have now additional means of buying other things but this will not create the other things unless there is capital to produce them and the improvement has not set at liberty any capital even if it has not absorbed some from other employments <\s>

<s> this is true not of machinery alone but of all improvements by which capital is sunk that is rendered permanently incapable of being applied to the maintenance and remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> it is highly probable that in the twenty five years preceding the panic of 1873 owing to the progress of invention those industries in the united states employing much machinery were unduly stimulated in comparison with other industries and that the readjustment was a slow and painful process <\s>
<s> after the collapse vast numbers left the manufacturing to enter the extractive industries <\s>
<s> the argument relied on by most of those who contend that machinery can never be injurious to the laboring class is that by cheapening production it creates such an increased demand for the commodity as enables ere long a greater number of persons than ever to find employment in producing it <\s>
<s> the argument does not seem to me to have the weight commonly ascribed to it <\s>
<s> the fact though too broadly stated is no doubt often true <\s>
<s> the copyists who were thrown out of employment by the invention of printing were doubtless soon outnumbered by the compositors and pressmen who took their place and the number of laboring persons now employed in the cotton manufacture is many times greater than were so occupied previously to the inventions of hargreaves and arkwright which shows that besides the enormous fixed capital now embarked in the manufacture it also employs a far larger circulating capital than at any former time <\s>
<s> but if this capital was drawn from other employments if the funds which took the place of the capital sunk in costly machinery were supplied not by any additional saving consequent on the improvements but by drafts on the general capital of the community what better are the laboring classes for the mere transfer <\s>
<s> there is a machine used for sizing the cotton yarn to prepare it for weaving by which it is dried over a steam cylinder the wages for attendance on which were only two dollars per day as compared with an expenditure for labor of fourteen dollars per day to accomplish the same ends before the machine was invented <\s>
<s> all attempts to make out that the laboring classes as a collective body can not suffer temporarily by the introduction of machinery or by the sinking of capital in permanent improvements are i conceive necessarily fallacious 111 that they would suffer in the particular department of industry to which the change applies is generally admitted and obvious to common sense but it is often said that though employment is withdrawn from labor in one department an exactly equivalent employment is opened for it in others because what the consumers save in the increased cheapness of one particular article enables them to augment their consumption of others thereby increasing the demand for other kinds of labor <\s>
<s> this is plausible but as was shown in the last chapter involves a fallacy demand for commodities being a totally different thing from demand for labor <\s>
<s> it is true the consumers have now additional means of buying other things but this will not create the other things unless there is capital to produce them and the improvement has not set at liberty any capital even if it has not absorbed some from other employments <\s>
<s> if the improvement has lowered the cost of production it has often required less capital as well as less labor to produce the same quantity of goods or what is the same thing an increased product with the same capital <\s>
<s>    this seldom if ever occurs <\s>
<s> nevertheless i do not believe that as things are actually transacted improvements in production are often if ever injurious even temporarily to the laboring classes in the aggregate <\s>
<s> they would be so if they took place suddenly to a great amount because much of the capital sunk must necessarily in that case be provided from funds already employed as circulating capital <\s>
<s> but improvements are always introduced very gradually and are seldom or never made by withdrawing circulating capital from actual production but are made by the employment of the annual increase <\s>
<s> i doubt if there would be found a single example of a great increase of fixed capital at a time and place where circulating capital was not rapidly increasing likewise <\s>
<s> in the united states while the cost per yard of the manufactured goods has decreased and so made accessible to poorer classes than before the capital engaged in manufactures has increased so as to allow a vastly greater number of persons to be employed as will be seen by the following comparison of 1860 with 1880 taken from the last census returns <\s>
<s> 928 930 number of capital average total amount establishments <\s>
<s> number of paid in hands wages during employed <\s>
<s> 1860 140,433 1,009 855 1,311 246 378,878 966
1880 253,852 2,790 272 2,732 595 947,953 795    a hundred years ago one person in every family of five or six must have been absolutely needed to spin and weave by hand the fabrics required for the scanty clothing of the people now one person in two hundred or two hundred and fifty only need work in the factory to produce the cotton and woolen fabrics of the most amply clothed nation of the world    112 to these considerations must be added that even if improvements did for a time decrease the aggregate produce and the circulating capital of the community they would not the less tend in the long run to augment both <\s>
<s> this tendency of improvements in production to cause increased accumulation and thereby ultimately to increase the gross produce even if temporarily diminishing it will assume a still more decided character if it should appear that there are assignable limits both to the accumulation of capital and to the increase of production from the land which limits once attained all further increase of produce must stop but that improvements in production whatever may be their other effects tend to throw one or both of these limits farther off <\s>
<s> now these are truths which will appear in the clearest light in a subsequent stage of our investigation <\s>
<s> it will be seen that the quantity of capital which will or even which can be accumulated in any country and the amount of gross produce which will or even which can be raised bear a proportion to the state of the arts of production there existing and that every improvement even if for the time it diminish the circulating capital and the gross produce ultimately makes room for a larger amount of both than could possibly have existed otherwise <\s>
<s> it is this which is the conclusive answer to the objections against machinery and the proof thence arising of the ultimate benefit to laborers of mechanical inventions even in the existing state of society will hereafter be seen to be conclusive 113 chapter vi <\s>

<s> general causes of superior productiveness <\s>
<s> the most evident cause of superior productiveness is what are called natural advantages <\s>
