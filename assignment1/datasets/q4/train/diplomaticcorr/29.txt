<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>

<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>

<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>

<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>
<s> if it is once admitted that powers at war have a right to do whatever will weaken or terrify an enemy it is not possible to foresee where it will end <\s>
<s> it would be possible to burn the great cities of europe <\s>
<s> the savages who torture their prisoners do it to make themselves terrible in fine all the horrors of the barbarous ages may be introduced and justified <\s>
<s> the cruelties of our enemies have heretofore more than once exasperated the minds of the people so much as to excite apprehensions that they would proceed to retaliation which if once commenced might be carried to extremities to prevent which the congress issued an address exhorting to forbearance and a further trial by examples of generosity and lenity to recall their enemies to the practice of humanity amidst the calamities of war <\s>
<s> in consequence of which neither the congress nor any of the states apart have ever exercised or authorised the exercise of the right of retaliation <\s>

<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>
<s> such a naval force acting in concert with the armies of the united states would in all human probability take and destroy the whole british power in that part of the world <\s>

<s> upon their present naval superiority in those seas depend not only the dominion and rich commerce of their islands but the supply of their fleets and armies with provisions and every necessary <\s>
<s> they have nearly four hundred transports constantly employed in the service of their fleet and army in america passing from new york and rhode island to england ireland nova scotia and their west india islands and if any one link in this chain was struck off if their supplies from any one of these places should be interrupted their forces could not subsist <\s>
<s> great numbers of these vessels would necessarily fall into the hands of the french fleet and go as prizes to a sure market in the united states <\s>
<s> the admiralty shall make certain arrangements with the merchants of the country during these difficulties that is in plain english shall suspend the convoys in so far as relates to the abovementioned materials <\s>

<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>

<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>

<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>

<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>

<s> sir some late proceedings of the enemy have induced us to submit a few observations to your excellency's superior light and judgment <\s>
<s> his britannic majesty's commissioners in their manifesto of the 3d of october have denounced a change in the whole nature and future conduct of the war they have declared that the policy as well as the benevolence of great britain has thus far checked the extremes of war when they tended to distress the people and desolate the country that the whole contest is changed that the laws of self-preservation must now direct the conduct of great britain that these laws will direct her to render the united states of as little avail as possible to france if they are to become an accession to her and by every means in her power to destroy the new connexion contrived for her ruin <\s>
<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>
<s> ministers of state made in parliament a question concerning the meaning of this manifesto but no man who reads it and knows the history of their past conduct in this war can doubt its import <\s>
<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>
<s> if it is once admitted that powers at war have a right to do whatever will weaken or terrify an enemy it is not possible to foresee where it will end <\s>
<s> it would be possible to burn the great cities of europe <\s>
<s> the savages who torture their prisoners do it to make themselves terrible in fine all the horrors of the barbarous ages may be introduced and justified <\s>
<s> the cruelties of our enemies have heretofore more than once exasperated the minds of the people so much as to excite apprehensions that they would proceed to retaliation which if once commenced might be carried to extremities to prevent which the congress issued an address exhorting to forbearance and a further trial by examples of generosity and lenity to recall their enemies to the practice of humanity amidst the calamities of war <\s>
<s> in consequence of which neither the congress nor any of the states apart have ever exercised or authorised the exercise of the right of retaliation <\s>
<s> but now that commissioners vested with the authority of the nation have avowed such principles and published such threats the congress have by a resolution of the 30th of october solemnly and unanimously declared that they will retaliate <\s>
<s> whatever may be the pretences of the enemy it is the manifest drift of their policy to disgust the people of america with their new alliance by attempting to convince them that instead of shielding them from distress it has accumulated additional calamities upon them <\s>
<s> nothing certainly can more become a great and amiable character than to disappoint their purpose stop the progress of their cruelties and vindicate the rights of humanity which are so much injured by this manifesto <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>
<s> such a naval force acting in concert with the armies of the united states would in all human probability take and destroy the whole british power in that part of the world <\s>
<s> it would put their wealth and west indian commerce into the power of france and reduce them to the necessity of suing for peace <\s>
<s> upon their present naval superiority in those seas depend not only the dominion and rich commerce of their islands but the supply of their fleets and armies with provisions and every necessary <\s>
<s> they have nearly four hundred transports constantly employed in the service of their fleet and army in america passing from new york and rhode island to england ireland nova scotia and their west india islands and if any one link in this chain was struck off if their supplies from any one of these places should be interrupted their forces could not subsist <\s>
<s> great numbers of these vessels would necessarily fall into the hands of the french fleet and go as prizes to a sure market in the united states <\s>
<s> the admiralty shall make certain arrangements with the merchants of the country during these difficulties that is in plain english shall suspend the convoys in so far as relates to the abovementioned materials <\s>
<s> this addition spoils all the rest <\s>
<s> your friend appeared to me rather embarrassed <\s>
<s> he has sent for the most prudential persons on change to ask their advice concerning this addition which he considers arrant folly <\s>
<s> another person very much displeased with this addition says that if amsterdam persists firmly in demanding the strict observance of the treaties and a perfect neutrality she can counteract this manoeuvre <\s>
<s> otherwise the servile submission of the nation to the lash of the english will expose it to that of the french also who will deprive it of the privileges it has heretofore enjoyed in their country and will seize its vessels after the example of the english <\s>
<s> you may therefore expect in my next to hear of a vigorous and successful opposition on the part of the city or of a dreadful blow to the commerce and navigation of this country <\s>

<s> sir some late proceedings of the enemy have induced us to submit a few observations to your excellency's superior light and judgment <\s>
<s> his britannic majesty's commissioners in their manifesto of the 3d of october have denounced a change in the whole nature and future conduct of the war they have declared that the policy as well as the benevolence of great britain has thus far checked the extremes of war when they tended to distress the people and desolate the country that the whole contest is changed that the laws of self-preservation must now direct the conduct of great britain that these laws will direct her to render the united states of as little avail as possible to france if they are to become an accession to her and by every means in her power to destroy the new connexion contrived for her ruin <\s>
<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>
<s> ministers of state made in parliament a question concerning the meaning of this manifesto but no man who reads it and knows the history of their past conduct in this war can doubt its import <\s>
<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>
<s> if it is once admitted that powers at war have a right to do whatever will weaken or terrify an enemy it is not possible to foresee where it will end <\s>
<s> it would be possible to burn the great cities of europe <\s>
<s> the savages who torture their prisoners do it to make themselves terrible in fine all the horrors of the barbarous ages may be introduced and justified <\s>
<s> the cruelties of our enemies have heretofore more than once exasperated the minds of the people so much as to excite apprehensions that they would proceed to retaliation which if once commenced might be carried to extremities to prevent which the congress issued an address exhorting to forbearance and a further trial by examples of generosity and lenity to recall their enemies to the practice of humanity amidst the calamities of war <\s>
<s> in consequence of which neither the congress nor any of the states apart have ever exercised or authorised the exercise of the right of retaliation <\s>
<s> but now that commissioners vested with the authority of the nation have avowed such principles and published such threats the congress have by a resolution of the 30th of october solemnly and unanimously declared that they will retaliate <\s>
<s> whatever may be the pretences of the enemy it is the manifest drift of their policy to disgust the people of america with their new alliance by attempting to convince them that instead of shielding them from distress it has accumulated additional calamities upon them <\s>
<s> nothing certainly can more become a great and amiable character than to disappoint their purpose stop the progress of their cruelties and vindicate the rights of humanity which are so much injured by this manifesto <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>
<s> such a naval force acting in concert with the armies of the united states would in all human probability take and destroy the whole british power in that part of the world <\s>
<s> it would put their wealth and west indian commerce into the power of france and reduce them to the necessity of suing for peace <\s>
<s> upon their present naval superiority in those seas depend not only the dominion and rich commerce of their islands but the supply of their fleets and armies with provisions and every necessary <\s>
<s> they have nearly four hundred transports constantly employed in the service of their fleet and army in america passing from new york and rhode island to england ireland nova scotia and their west india islands and if any one link in this chain was struck off if their supplies from any one of these places should be interrupted their forces could not subsist <\s>
<s> great numbers of these vessels would necessarily fall into the hands of the french fleet and go as prizes to a sure market in the united states <\s>
<s> the admiralty shall make certain arrangements with the merchants of the country during these difficulties that is in plain english shall suspend the convoys in so far as relates to the abovementioned materials <\s>
<s> this addition spoils all the rest <\s>
<s> your friend appeared to me rather embarrassed <\s>
<s> he has sent for the most prudential persons on change to ask their advice concerning this addition which he considers arrant folly <\s>
<s> another person very much displeased with this addition says that if amsterdam persists firmly in demanding the strict observance of the treaties and a perfect neutrality she can counteract this manoeuvre <\s>
<s> otherwise the servile submission of the nation to the lash of the english will expose it to that of the french also who will deprive it of the privileges it has heretofore enjoyed in their country and will seize its vessels after the example of the english <\s>
<s> you may therefore expect in my next to hear of a vigorous and successful opposition on the part of the city or of a dreadful blow to the commerce and navigation of this country <\s>

<s> sir some late proceedings of the enemy have induced us to submit a few observations to your excellency's superior light and judgment <\s>
<s> his britannic majesty's commissioners in their manifesto of the 3d of october have denounced a change in the whole nature and future conduct of the war they have declared that the policy as well as the benevolence of great britain has thus far checked the extremes of war when they tended to distress the people and desolate the country that the whole contest is changed that the laws of self-preservation must now direct the conduct of great britain that these laws will direct her to render the united states of as little avail as possible to france if they are to become an accession to her and by every means in her power to destroy the new connexion contrived for her ruin <\s>
<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>
<s> ministers of state made in parliament a question concerning the meaning of this manifesto but no man who reads it and knows the history of their past conduct in this war can doubt its import <\s>
<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>
<s> if it is once admitted that powers at war have a right to do whatever will weaken or terrify an enemy it is not possible to foresee where it will end <\s>
<s> it would be possible to burn the great cities of europe <\s>
<s> the savages who torture their prisoners do it to make themselves terrible in fine all the horrors of the barbarous ages may be introduced and justified <\s>
<s> the cruelties of our enemies have heretofore more than once exasperated the minds of the people so much as to excite apprehensions that they would proceed to retaliation which if once commenced might be carried to extremities to prevent which the congress issued an address exhorting to forbearance and a further trial by examples of generosity and lenity to recall their enemies to the practice of humanity amidst the calamities of war <\s>
<s> in consequence of which neither the congress nor any of the states apart have ever exercised or authorised the exercise of the right of retaliation <\s>
<s> but now that commissioners vested with the authority of the nation have avowed such principles and published such threats the congress have by a resolution of the 30th of october solemnly and unanimously declared that they will retaliate <\s>
<s> whatever may be the pretences of the enemy it is the manifest drift of their policy to disgust the people of america with their new alliance by attempting to convince them that instead of shielding them from distress it has accumulated additional calamities upon them <\s>
<s> nothing certainly can more become a great and amiable character than to disappoint their purpose stop the progress of their cruelties and vindicate the rights of humanity which are so much injured by this manifesto <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>
<s> such a naval force acting in concert with the armies of the united states would in all human probability take and destroy the whole british power in that part of the world <\s>
<s> it would put their wealth and west indian commerce into the power of france and reduce them to the necessity of suing for peace <\s>
<s> upon their present naval superiority in those seas depend not only the dominion and rich commerce of their islands but the supply of their fleets and armies with provisions and every necessary <\s>
<s> they have nearly four hundred transports constantly employed in the service of their fleet and army in america passing from new york and rhode island to england ireland nova scotia and their west india islands and if any one link in this chain was struck off if their supplies from any one of these places should be interrupted their forces could not subsist <\s>
<s> great numbers of these vessels would necessarily fall into the hands of the french fleet and go as prizes to a sure market in the united states <\s>
<s> the admiralty shall make certain arrangements with the merchants of the country during these difficulties that is in plain english shall suspend the convoys in so far as relates to the abovementioned materials <\s>
<s> this addition spoils all the rest <\s>
<s> your friend appeared to me rather embarrassed <\s>
<s> he has sent for the most prudential persons on change to ask their advice concerning this addition which he considers arrant folly <\s>
<s> another person very much displeased with this addition says that if amsterdam persists firmly in demanding the strict observance of the treaties and a perfect neutrality she can counteract this manoeuvre <\s>
<s> otherwise the servile submission of the nation to the lash of the english will expose it to that of the french also who will deprive it of the privileges it has heretofore enjoyed in their country and will seize its vessels after the example of the english <\s>
<s> you may therefore expect in my next to hear of a vigorous and successful opposition on the part of the city or of a dreadful blow to the commerce and navigation of this country <\s>

<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>

<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>

<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>

<s> his britannic majesty's commissioners in their manifesto of the 3d of october have denounced a change in the whole nature and future conduct of the war they have declared that the policy as well as the benevolence of great britain has thus far checked the extremes of war when they tended to distress the people and desolate the country that the whole contest is changed that the laws of self-preservation must now direct the conduct of great britain that these laws will direct her to render the united states of as little avail as possible to france if they are to become an accession to her and by every means in her power to destroy the new connexion contrived for her ruin <\s>
<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>
<s> ministers of state made in parliament a question concerning the meaning of this manifesto but no man who reads it and knows the history of their past conduct in this war can doubt its import <\s>
<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>
<s> if it is once admitted that powers at war have a right to do whatever will weaken or terrify an enemy it is not possible to foresee where it will end <\s>
<s> it would be possible to burn the great cities of europe <\s>
<s> the savages who torture their prisoners do it to make themselves terrible in fine all the horrors of the barbarous ages may be introduced and justified <\s>
<s> the cruelties of our enemies have heretofore more than once exasperated the minds of the people so much as to excite apprehensions that they would proceed to retaliation which if once commenced might be carried to extremities to prevent which the congress issued an address exhorting to forbearance and a further trial by examples of generosity and lenity to recall their enemies to the practice of humanity amidst the calamities of war <\s>
<s> in consequence of which neither the congress nor any of the states apart have ever exercised or authorised the exercise of the right of retaliation <\s>

<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>
<s> such a naval force acting in concert with the armies of the united states would in all human probability take and destroy the whole british power in that part of the world <\s>

<s> upon their present naval superiority in those seas depend not only the dominion and rich commerce of their islands but the supply of their fleets and armies with provisions and every necessary <\s>

<s> great numbers of these vessels would necessarily fall into the hands of the french fleet and go as prizes to a sure market in the united states <\s>
<s> the admiralty shall make certain arrangements with the merchants of the country during these difficulties that is in plain english shall suspend the convoys in so far as relates to the abovementioned materials <\s>

<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>

<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>

<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>

<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>

<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>

<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>

<s> motions have been made and supported by the wisest men in both houses of parliament to address the king to disavow these clauses but these motions have been rejected by majorities in both houses so that the manifesto stands avowed by the three branches of the legislature <\s>

<s> there is to be a change in the nature and conduct of the war <\s>
<s> a change for the worse must be horrible indeed <\s>
<s> they have already burned the beautiful towns of charlestown falmouth norfolk kingston bedford egg harbour and german flatts besides innumerable single buildings and smaller clusters of houses wherever their armies have marched <\s>
<s> it is true they left boston and philadelphia unhurt but in all probability it was merely the dread of a superior army that in these cases restrained their hands not to mention that burning these towns would have been the ruin of the few secret friends they have still left of whom there are more in those towns than in all america besides <\s>
<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>
<s> they have also done their utmost in seducing negroes and indians to commit inhuman barbarities upon the inhabitants sparing neither age sex nor character <\s>
<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>
<s> many others they have compelled by force to serve and fight on board their ships against fathers brothers friends and countrymen a destiny to every sensible mind more terrible than death itself <\s>
<s> it is therefore difficult to comprehend what they mean by a change in the conduct of the war yet there seems to be no room to doubt that they mean to threaten something more cruel greater extremes of war measures that shall distress the people and lay waste the country more than any thing they have yet done <\s>
<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>

<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>

<s> they have not indeed murdered upon the spot _every_ woman and child that fell in their way nor have they in _all_ cases refused quarters to the soldiers that at _all_ times have fallen into their power though they have in many <\s>

<s> although they have not in all cases refused quarter to soldiers and sailors they have done what is worse than refusing quarters they have thrust their prisoners into such dungeons loaded them with such irons and exposed them to such lingering torments of cold hunger and disease as have destroyed greater numbers than they could have had an opportunity of murdering if they had made it a rule to give no quarter <\s>

<s> the object of the war is now entirely changed <\s>
<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>

<s> heretofore their massacres and conflagrations were to divide us and reclaim us to great britain <\s>
<s> now despairing of that end and perceiving that we shall be faithful to our treaties their principle is by destroying us to make us useless to france <\s>
<s> this principle ought to be held in abhorrence not only by all christians but by all civilized nations <\s>
<s> if it is once admitted that powers at war have a right to do whatever will weaken or terrify an enemy it is not possible to foresee where it will end <\s>
<s> it would be possible to burn the great cities of europe <\s>
<s> the savages who torture their prisoners do it to make themselves terrible in fine all the horrors of the barbarous ages may be introduced and justified <\s>
<s> the cruelties of our enemies have heretofore more than once exasperated the minds of the people so much as to excite apprehensions that they would proceed to retaliation which if once commenced might be carried to extremities to prevent which the congress issued an address exhorting to forbearance and a further trial by examples of generosity and lenity to recall their enemies to the practice of humanity amidst the calamities of war <\s>
<s> in consequence of which neither the congress nor any of the states apart have ever exercised or authorised the exercise of the right of retaliation <\s>
<s> but now that commissioners vested with the authority of the nation have avowed such principles and published such threats the congress have by a resolution of the 30th of october solemnly and unanimously declared that they will retaliate <\s>
<s> whatever may be the pretences of the enemy it is the manifest drift of their policy to disgust the people of america with their new alliance by attempting to convince them that instead of shielding them from distress it has accumulated additional calamities upon them <\s>
<s> nothing certainly can more become a great and amiable character than to disappoint their purpose stop the progress of their cruelties and vindicate the rights of humanity which are so much injured by this manifesto <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to suggest to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be advisable for his majesty to interfere by some declaration to the court of london and to the world bearing the royal testimony against this barbarous mode of war and giving assurances that he will join the united states in retaliation if great britain by putting her threats in execution should make it necessary <\s>
<s> there is another measure however more effectual to control their designs and to bring the war to a speedy conclusion that of sending a powerful fleet sufficient to secure a naval superiority over them in the american seas <\s>
<s> such a naval force acting in concert with the armies of the united states would in all human probability take and destroy the whole british power in that part of the world <\s>
<s> it would put their wealth and west indian commerce into the power of france and reduce them to the necessity of suing for peace <\s>
<s> upon their present naval superiority in those seas depend not only the dominion and rich commerce of their islands but the supply of their fleets and armies with provisions and every necessary <\s>
<s> they have nearly four hundred transports constantly employed in the service of their fleet and army in america passing from new york and rhode island to england ireland nova scotia and their west india islands and if any one link in this chain was struck off if their supplies from any one of these places should be interrupted their forces could not subsist <\s>
<s> great numbers of these vessels would necessarily fall into the hands of the french fleet and go as prizes to a sure market in the united states <\s>
