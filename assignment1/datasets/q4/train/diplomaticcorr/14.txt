<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>
<s> from the time of dr franklin's sailing until we arrived at this place the ships of war at the mouth of the delaware and the interruption given the post added to the barrenness of events prevented us from writing when we had no particular commands from congress for you <\s>
<s> mr bingham informs us from martinique that he learned from a spanish general there on his way to south america that the king of spain was well disposed to do the united states offices of friendship and that a loan of money might be obtained from that court <\s>
<s> as the power sent you for borrowing is not confined to place we mention this intelligence that you may avail yourselves of his catholic majesty's friendly designs <\s>

<s> he has delivered us three sets of the papers we wanted but we shall want more and _beg you will not fail to send them by several opportunities <\s>

<s> with a universal good will to our cause and country apparent in all companies there is mixed a universal apprehension that we shall be reduced to submission which often chills the purposes of serving us <\s>
<s> the want of intelligence from america and the impossibility of contradicting by that means the false news spread here and all over europe by the enemy has a bad effect on the minds of many who would adventure in trade to our ports as well as on the conduct of the several governments of europe <\s>
<s> it is now more than three months since doctor franklin left philadelphia and we have not received a single letter of later date mr hodge having left that place before him <\s>
<s> we are about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packets <\s>
<s> in the first we despatch we shall write more particularly concerning our proceedings here than by these merchant ships we can venture to do for the orders given to sink letters are not well executed one of our vessels was lately carried into gibraltar being taken by an english man of war and we hear there were letters for us which the captain just as he was boarded threw out of the cabin windows which floating on the water were taken up and a sloop despatched with them to london <\s>
<s> we also just now hear from london through the ministry here that another of our ships is carried into bristol by the crew who consisting of eight american seamen with eight english and four of the americans being sick the other four were overpowered by the eight english and carried in as aforesaid <\s>
<s> the letters were despatched to court <\s>
<s> from london they write to us that a body of ten thousand men chiefly germans are to go out this spring under the command of general burgoyne for the invasion of virginia and maryland <\s>
<s> the opinion of this court founded on their advices from germany is that such a number can by no means be obtained but you will be on your guard <\s>

<s> it is quite a business to receive the applications and refuse them <\s>
<s> many have gone over at their own expense contrary to our advice <\s>
<s> to some few of those who were well recommended we have given letters of introduction <\s>
<s> the conduct of our general in avoiding a decisive action is much applauded by the military people here particularly marshals maillebois broglio and d'arcy <\s>
<s> maillebois has taken the pains to write his sentiments of some particulars useful in carrying on our war which we send enclosed <\s>
<s> but that which makes the greatest impression in our favor here is the prodigious success of our armed ships and privateers <\s>
<s> the damage we have done their west india trade has been estimated in a representation to lord sandwich by the merchants of london at one million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling which has raised insurance to twentyeight per cent being higher than at any time in the last war with france and spain <\s>
<s> this mode of exerting our force against them should be pushed with vigor <\s>
<s> it is that in which we can most sensibly hurt them and to secure a continuance of it we think one or two of the engineers we send over may be usefully employed in making some of our ports impregnable <\s>
<s> as we are well informed that a number of cutters are building to cruise in the west indies against our small privateers it may not be amiss we think to send your larger vessels thither and ply in other quarters with the small ones <\s>
<s> a fresh misunderstanding between the turks and russia is likely to give so much employment to the troops of the latter as that england can hardly expect to obtain any of them <\s>
<s> her malice against us however is so high at present that she would stick at no expense to gratify it <\s>
<s> the new england colonies are according to our best information destined to destruction and the rest to slavery under a military government <\s>
<s> but the governor of the world sets bounds to the rage of man as well as to that of the ocean <\s>
<s> finding that our residence here together is nearly as expensive as if we were separate and _having reason to believe that one of us might be useful at madrid and another in holland and some courts further northward we have agreed that mr lee go to spain and either mr deane or myself dr franklin to the hague <\s>
<s> mr lee sets out tomorrow having obtained passports and a letter from the spanish ambassador here to the minister there <\s>
<s> the journey to holland will not take place so soon <\s>
<s> the particular purposes of these journeys we cannot prudently now explain <\s>
<s> it is proper we should acquaint you with the behavior of one nicholas davis who came to us here pretending to have served as in officer in india to be originally from boston and desirous of returning to act in defence of his country but through the loss of some effects coming to him from jamaica and taken by our privateers unable to defray the expense of his passage <\s>
<s> we furnished him with thirty louis which was fully sufficient but at havre just before he sailed he took the liberty of drawing on us for near forty more which we have been obliged to pay <\s>

<s> gentlemen the events of war have not since our last furnished anything decisive <\s>
<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>

<s> gentlemen the events of war have not since our last furnished anything decisive <\s>
<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>
<s> from the time of dr franklin's sailing until we arrived at this place the ships of war at the mouth of the delaware and the interruption given the post added to the barrenness of events prevented us from writing when we had no particular commands from congress for you <\s>
<s> mr bingham informs us from martinique that he learned from a spanish general there on his way to south america that the king of spain was well disposed to do the united states offices of friendship and that a loan of money might be obtained from that court <\s>
<s> as the power sent you for borrowing is not confined to place we mention this intelligence that you may avail yourselves of his catholic majesty's friendly designs <\s>
<s> perhaps a loan may be obtained there on better terms than elsewhere <\s>
<s> we expect it will not be long before congress will appoint commissioners to the courts formerly mentioned and in the mean time you will serve the cause of your country in the best manner with the ministers from those courts to that of versailles <\s>

<s> he had a long passage and was near being starved <\s>
<s> we are about to employ him in a service pointed out by you at dunkirk or flushing <\s>
<s> he has delivered us three sets of the papers we wanted but we shall want more and _beg you will not fail to send them by several opportunities <\s>
<s> a private company has just been formed here for the importation of tobacco who have made such proposals to the farmers-general as induced them to suspend the signing of their agreement with us though the terms had been settled and the writings drawn <\s>
<s> it seems now uncertain whether it will be revived or not <\s>
<s> the company have offered to export such goods as we should advise and we have given them a list of those most wanted <\s>
<s> but so changeable are minds here on occasion of news good or bad that one cannot be sure that even this company will proceed <\s>
<s> with a universal good will to our cause and country apparent in all companies there is mixed a universal apprehension that we shall be reduced to submission which often chills the purposes of serving us <\s>
<s> the want of intelligence from america and the impossibility of contradicting by that means the false news spread here and all over europe by the enemy has a bad effect on the minds of many who would adventure in trade to our ports as well as on the conduct of the several governments of europe <\s>
<s> it is now more than three months since doctor franklin left philadelphia and we have not received a single letter of later date mr hodge having left that place before him <\s>
<s> we are about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packets <\s>
<s> in the first we despatch we shall write more particularly concerning our proceedings here than by these merchant ships we can venture to do for the orders given to sink letters are not well executed one of our vessels was lately carried into gibraltar being taken by an english man of war and we hear there were letters for us which the captain just as he was boarded threw out of the cabin windows which floating on the water were taken up and a sloop despatched with them to london <\s>
<s> we also just now hear from london through the ministry here that another of our ships is carried into bristol by the crew who consisting of eight american seamen with eight english and four of the americans being sick the other four were overpowered by the eight english and carried in as aforesaid <\s>
<s> the letters were despatched to court <\s>
<s> from london they write to us that a body of ten thousand men chiefly germans are to go out this spring under the command of general burgoyne for the invasion of virginia and maryland <\s>
<s> the opinion of this court founded on their advices from germany is that such a number can by no means be obtained but you will be on your guard <\s>
<s> the amphitrite and the seine from havre and the mercury from nantes are all now at sea laden with arms ammunition brass field pieces stores clothing canvass c <\s>
<s> which if they arrive safely will put you in a much better condition for the next campaign than you were for the last <\s>
<s> some excellent engineers and officers of the artillery will also be with you pretty early also some few for the cavalry <\s>
<s> officers of infantry of all ranks have offered themselves without number <\s>
<s> it is quite a business to receive the applications and refuse them <\s>
<s> many have gone over at their own expense contrary to our advice <\s>
<s> to some few of those who were well recommended we have given letters of introduction <\s>
<s> the conduct of our general in avoiding a decisive action is much applauded by the military people here particularly marshals maillebois broglio and d'arcy <\s>
<s> maillebois has taken the pains to write his sentiments of some particulars useful in carrying on our war which we send enclosed <\s>
<s> but that which makes the greatest impression in our favor here is the prodigious success of our armed ships and privateers <\s>
<s> the damage we have done their west india trade has been estimated in a representation to lord sandwich by the merchants of london at one million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling which has raised insurance to twentyeight per cent being higher than at any time in the last war with france and spain <\s>
<s> this mode of exerting our force against them should be pushed with vigor <\s>
<s> it is that in which we can most sensibly hurt them and to secure a continuance of it we think one or two of the engineers we send over may be usefully employed in making some of our ports impregnable <\s>
<s> as we are well informed that a number of cutters are building to cruise in the west indies against our small privateers it may not be amiss we think to send your larger vessels thither and ply in other quarters with the small ones <\s>
<s> a fresh misunderstanding between the turks and russia is likely to give so much employment to the troops of the latter as that england can hardly expect to obtain any of them <\s>
<s> her malice against us however is so high at present that she would stick at no expense to gratify it <\s>
<s> the new england colonies are according to our best information destined to destruction and the rest to slavery under a military government <\s>
<s> but the governor of the world sets bounds to the rage of man as well as to that of the ocean <\s>
<s> finding that our residence here together is nearly as expensive as if we were separate and _having reason to believe that one of us might be useful at madrid and another in holland and some courts further northward we have agreed that mr lee go to spain and either mr deane or myself dr franklin to the hague <\s>
<s> mr lee sets out tomorrow having obtained passports and a letter from the spanish ambassador here to the minister there <\s>
<s> the journey to holland will not take place so soon <\s>
<s> the particular purposes of these journeys we cannot prudently now explain <\s>
<s> it is proper we should acquaint you with the behavior of one nicholas davis who came to us here pretending to have served as in officer in india to be originally from boston and desirous of returning to act in defence of his country but through the loss of some effects coming to him from jamaica and taken by our privateers unable to defray the expense of his passage <\s>
<s> we furnished him with thirty louis which was fully sufficient but at havre just before he sailed he took the liberty of drawing on us for near forty more which we have been obliged to pay <\s>
<s> as in order to obtain that credit he was guilty of several falsities we now doubt his ever having been an officer at all <\s>
<s> we send his note and draft and hope you will take proper care of him <\s>

<s> with a universal good will to our cause and country apparent in all companies there is mixed a universal apprehension that we shall be reduced to submission which often chills the purposes of serving us <\s>
<s> the want of intelligence from america and the impossibility of contradicting by that means the false news spread here and all over europe by the enemy has a bad effect on the minds of many who would adventure in trade to our ports as well as on the conduct of the several governments of europe <\s>
<s> it is now more than three months since doctor franklin left philadelphia and we have not received a single letter of later date mr hodge having left that place before him <\s>
<s> we are about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packets <\s>
<s> in the first we despatch we shall write more particularly concerning our proceedings here than by these merchant ships we can venture to do for the orders given to sink letters are not well executed one of our vessels was lately carried into gibraltar being taken by an english man of war and we hear there were letters for us which the captain just as he was boarded threw out of the cabin windows which floating on the water were taken up and a sloop despatched with them to london <\s>
<s> we also just now hear from london through the ministry here that another of our ships is carried into bristol by the crew who consisting of eight american seamen with eight english and four of the americans being sick the other four were overpowered by the eight english and carried in as aforesaid <\s>

<s> it is quite a business to receive the applications and refuse them <\s>
<s> many have gone over at their own expense contrary to our advice <\s>
<s> to some few of those who were well recommended we have given letters of introduction <\s>
<s> the conduct of our general in avoiding a decisive action is much applauded by the military people here particularly marshals maillebois broglio and d'arcy <\s>
<s> maillebois has taken the pains to write his sentiments of some particulars useful in carrying on our war which we send enclosed <\s>

<s> the damage we have done their west india trade has been estimated in a representation to lord sandwich by the merchants of london at one million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling which has raised insurance to twentyeight per cent being higher than at any time in the last war with france and spain <\s>

<s> it is that in which we can most sensibly hurt them and to secure a continuance of it we think one or two of the engineers we send over may be usefully employed in making some of our ports impregnable <\s>
<s> as we are well informed that a number of cutters are building to cruise in the west indies against our small privateers it may not be amiss we think to send your larger vessels thither and ply in other quarters with the small ones <\s>

<s> gentlemen the events of war have not since our last furnished anything decisive <\s>
<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>
<s> from the time of dr franklin's sailing until we arrived at this place the ships of war at the mouth of the delaware and the interruption given the post added to the barrenness of events prevented us from writing when we had no particular commands from congress for you <\s>

<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>
<s> from the time of dr franklin's sailing until we arrived at this place the ships of war at the mouth of the delaware and the interruption given the post added to the barrenness of events prevented us from writing when we had no particular commands from congress for you <\s>
<s> mr bingham informs us from martinique that he learned from a spanish general there on his way to south america that the king of spain was well disposed to do the united states offices of friendship and that a loan of money might be obtained from that court <\s>
<s> as the power sent you for borrowing is not confined to place we mention this intelligence that you may avail yourselves of his catholic majesty's friendly designs <\s>

<s> he has delivered us three sets of the papers we wanted but we shall want more and _beg you will not fail to send them by several opportunities <\s>

<s> with a universal good will to our cause and country apparent in all companies there is mixed a universal apprehension that we shall be reduced to submission which often chills the purposes of serving us <\s>
<s> the want of intelligence from america and the impossibility of contradicting by that means the false news spread here and all over europe by the enemy has a bad effect on the minds of many who would adventure in trade to our ports as well as on the conduct of the several governments of europe <\s>
<s> it is now more than three months since doctor franklin left philadelphia and we have not received a single letter of later date mr hodge having left that place before him <\s>
<s> we are about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packets <\s>
<s> in the first we despatch we shall write more particularly concerning our proceedings here than by these merchant ships we can venture to do for the orders given to sink letters are not well executed one of our vessels was lately carried into gibraltar being taken by an english man of war and we hear there were letters for us which the captain just as he was boarded threw out of the cabin windows which floating on the water were taken up and a sloop despatched with them to london <\s>
<s> we also just now hear from london through the ministry here that another of our ships is carried into bristol by the crew who consisting of eight american seamen with eight english and four of the americans being sick the other four were overpowered by the eight english and carried in as aforesaid <\s>
<s> the letters were despatched to court <\s>
<s> from london they write to us that a body of ten thousand men chiefly germans are to go out this spring under the command of general burgoyne for the invasion of virginia and maryland <\s>
<s> the opinion of this court founded on their advices from germany is that such a number can by no means be obtained but you will be on your guard <\s>

<s> it is quite a business to receive the applications and refuse them <\s>
<s> many have gone over at their own expense contrary to our advice <\s>
<s> to some few of those who were well recommended we have given letters of introduction <\s>
<s> the conduct of our general in avoiding a decisive action is much applauded by the military people here particularly marshals maillebois broglio and d'arcy <\s>
<s> maillebois has taken the pains to write his sentiments of some particulars useful in carrying on our war which we send enclosed <\s>
<s> but that which makes the greatest impression in our favor here is the prodigious success of our armed ships and privateers <\s>
<s> the damage we have done their west india trade has been estimated in a representation to lord sandwich by the merchants of london at one million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling which has raised insurance to twentyeight per cent being higher than at any time in the last war with france and spain <\s>
<s> this mode of exerting our force against them should be pushed with vigor <\s>
<s> it is that in which we can most sensibly hurt them and to secure a continuance of it we think one or two of the engineers we send over may be usefully employed in making some of our ports impregnable <\s>
<s> as we are well informed that a number of cutters are building to cruise in the west indies against our small privateers it may not be amiss we think to send your larger vessels thither and ply in other quarters with the small ones <\s>
<s> a fresh misunderstanding between the turks and russia is likely to give so much employment to the troops of the latter as that england can hardly expect to obtain any of them <\s>
<s> her malice against us however is so high at present that she would stick at no expense to gratify it <\s>
<s> the new england colonies are according to our best information destined to destruction and the rest to slavery under a military government <\s>
<s> but the governor of the world sets bounds to the rage of man as well as to that of the ocean <\s>
<s> finding that our residence here together is nearly as expensive as if we were separate and _having reason to believe that one of us might be useful at madrid and another in holland and some courts further northward we have agreed that mr lee go to spain and either mr deane or myself dr franklin to the hague <\s>
<s> mr lee sets out tomorrow having obtained passports and a letter from the spanish ambassador here to the minister there <\s>
<s> the journey to holland will not take place so soon <\s>
<s> the particular purposes of these journeys we cannot prudently now explain <\s>
<s> it is proper we should acquaint you with the behavior of one nicholas davis who came to us here pretending to have served as in officer in india to be originally from boston and desirous of returning to act in defence of his country but through the loss of some effects coming to him from jamaica and taken by our privateers unable to defray the expense of his passage <\s>
<s> we furnished him with thirty louis which was fully sufficient but at havre just before he sailed he took the liberty of drawing on us for near forty more which we have been obliged to pay <\s>

<s> gentlemen the events of war have not since our last furnished anything decisive <\s>
<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>

<s> gentlemen the events of war have not since our last furnished anything decisive <\s>
<s> the enemy's army still remains encamped upon the hills near brunswick and our troops still continue to beat back their convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulty of removing their stores cannon c will be insuperably great until the opening of the rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to new york <\s>
<s> the american army is not numerous at present but the new levies are collecting as fast as possible and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field <\s>
<s> we hear by the speech of the king of great britain to his parliament that much money will be called for no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor <\s>
<s> that we shall oppose with all our power will be certain but the event must be doubtful until france takes a decisive part in the war <\s>
<s> when that happens our liberties will be secured and the glory and greatness of france be placed on the most solid ground <\s>
<s> what may be the consequence of her delay must be a painful consideration to every friend of liberty and mankind <\s>
<s> thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country <\s>
<s> it is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of tobacco rice indigo flour and other valuable articles of merchandise if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of great britain to contend against <\s>
<s> it is not only for the interest of these states but clearly for the benefit of europe in general that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there <\s>
<s> why should the avarice and ambition of great britain be gratified to the great injury of other nations <\s>
<s> mr deane recommends sending frigates to france to convoy our merchandise but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend that we are young in the business of fitting out ships of war that founderies for cannon are to be erected that there is great difficulty of getting seamen quickly when privateers abound as they do in the states where sailors are chiefly to be met with and lastly that our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy which are placed at the entrance of our bays <\s>
<s> in short the attention of great britain must be drawn in part from hence before france can benefit largely by our commerce <\s>
<s> we sensibly feel the disagreeable situation mr deane must have been in between his receipt of the committee's letter in june and the date of his own letter in october but this was occasioned by accident not neglect since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months which have either fallen into the enemy's hands or have been destroyed <\s>
<s> from the time of dr franklin's sailing until we arrived at this place the ships of war at the mouth of the delaware and the interruption given the post added to the barrenness of events prevented us from writing when we had no particular commands from congress for you <\s>
<s> mr bingham informs us from martinique that he learned from a spanish general there on his way to south america that the king of spain was well disposed to do the united states offices of friendship and that a loan of money might be obtained from that court <\s>
<s> as the power sent you for borrowing is not confined to place we mention this intelligence that you may avail yourselves of his catholic majesty's friendly designs <\s>

<s> gentlemen since our last a copy of which is enclosed mr hodge arrived here from martinique and has brought safely the papers he was charged with <\s>
<s> he had a long passage and was near being starved <\s>
<s> we are about to employ him in a service pointed out by you at dunkirk or flushing <\s>
<s> he has delivered us three sets of the papers we wanted but we shall want more and _beg you will not fail to send them by several opportunities <\s>
<s> a private company has just been formed here for the importation of tobacco who have made such proposals to the farmers-general as induced them to suspend the signing of their agreement with us though the terms had been settled and the writings drawn <\s>
<s> it seems now uncertain whether it will be revived or not <\s>
<s> the company have offered to export such goods as we should advise and we have given them a list of those most wanted <\s>
<s> but so changeable are minds here on occasion of news good or bad that one cannot be sure that even this company will proceed <\s>
<s> with a universal good will to our cause and country apparent in all companies there is mixed a universal apprehension that we shall be reduced to submission which often chills the purposes of serving us <\s>
<s> the want of intelligence from america and the impossibility of contradicting by that means the false news spread here and all over europe by the enemy has a bad effect on the minds of many who would adventure in trade to our ports as well as on the conduct of the several governments of europe <\s>
<s> it is now more than three months since doctor franklin left philadelphia and we have not received a single letter of later date mr hodge having left that place before him <\s>
<s> we are about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packets <\s>
<s> in the first we despatch we shall write more particularly concerning our proceedings here than by these merchant ships we can venture to do for the orders given to sink letters are not well executed one of our vessels was lately carried into gibraltar being taken by an english man of war and we hear there were letters for us which the captain just as he was boarded threw out of the cabin windows which floating on the water were taken up and a sloop despatched with them to london <\s>
<s> we also just now hear from london through the ministry here that another of our ships is carried into bristol by the crew who consisting of eight american seamen with eight english and four of the americans being sick the other four were overpowered by the eight english and carried in as aforesaid <\s>
<s> the letters were despatched to court <\s>
<s> from london they write to us that a body of ten thousand men chiefly germans are to go out this spring under the command of general burgoyne for the invasion of virginia and maryland <\s>
<s> the opinion of this court founded on their advices from germany is that such a number can by no means be obtained but you will be on your guard <\s>
<s> the amphitrite and the seine from havre and the mercury from nantes are all now at sea laden with arms ammunition brass field pieces stores clothing canvass c <\s>
<s> which if they arrive safely will put you in a much better condition for the next campaign than you were for the last <\s>
<s> some excellent engineers and officers of the artillery will also be with you pretty early also some few for the cavalry <\s>
<s> officers of infantry of all ranks have offered themselves without number <\s>
<s> it is quite a business to receive the applications and refuse them <\s>
<s> many have gone over at their own expense contrary to our advice <\s>
<s> to some few of those who were well recommended we have given letters of introduction <\s>
<s> the conduct of our general in avoiding a decisive action is much applauded by the military people here particularly marshals maillebois broglio and d'arcy <\s>
<s> maillebois has taken the pains to write his sentiments of some particulars useful in carrying on our war which we send enclosed <\s>
<s> but that which makes the greatest impression in our favor here is the prodigious success of our armed ships and privateers <\s>
<s> the damage we have done their west india trade has been estimated in a representation to lord sandwich by the merchants of london at one million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling which has raised insurance to twentyeight per cent being higher than at any time in the last war with france and spain <\s>
<s> this mode of exerting our force against them should be pushed with vigor <\s>
<s> it is that in which we can most sensibly hurt them and to secure a continuance of it we think one or two of the engineers we send over may be usefully employed in making some of our ports impregnable <\s>
<s> as we are well informed that a number of cutters are building to cruise in the west indies against our small privateers it may not be amiss we think to send your larger vessels thither and ply in other quarters with the small ones <\s>
<s> a fresh misunderstanding between the turks and russia is likely to give so much employment to the troops of the latter as that england can hardly expect to obtain any of them <\s>
<s> her malice against us however is so high at present that she would stick at no expense to gratify it <\s>
<s> the new england colonies are according to our best information destined to destruction and the rest to slavery under a military government <\s>
<s> but the governor of the world sets bounds to the rage of man as well as to that of the ocean <\s>
<s> finding that our residence here together is nearly as expensive as if we were separate and _having reason to believe that one of us might be useful at madrid and another in holland and some courts further northward we have agreed that mr lee go to spain and either mr deane or myself dr franklin to the hague <\s>
<s> mr lee sets out tomorrow having obtained passports and a letter from the spanish ambassador here to the minister there <\s>
<s> the journey to holland will not take place so soon <\s>
<s> the particular purposes of these journeys we cannot prudently now explain <\s>
<s> it is proper we should acquaint you with the behavior of one nicholas davis who came to us here pretending to have served as in officer in india to be originally from boston and desirous of returning to act in defence of his country but through the loss of some effects coming to him from jamaica and taken by our privateers unable to defray the expense of his passage <\s>
<s> we furnished him with thirty louis which was fully sufficient but at havre just before he sailed he took the liberty of drawing on us for near forty more which we have been obliged to pay <\s>
<s> as in order to obtain that credit he was guilty of several falsities we now doubt his ever having been an officer at all <\s>
<s> we send his note and draft and hope you will take proper care of him <\s>
