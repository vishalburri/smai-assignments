<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>

<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>

<s> i should never have completed what i have but for the generous the indefatigable and spirited exertions of monsieur beaumarchais to whom the united states are on every account greatly indebted more so than to any other person on this side the water he is greatly in advance for stores clothing and the like and therefore i am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances <\s>

<s> this i have confidently assured his uncle he will receive from you and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score and in whatever department you may fix him that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part <\s>
<s> a particular account of the stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel but may go by the next or some succeeding one as several will sail after this on the same errand <\s>
<s> let me by every letter urge on you the sending in season a quantity of tobacco of rice and flour or wheat <\s>
<s> these are articles which cannot fail and are capital ones twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in france besides the demand in other kingdoms <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have recommended several officers to your service but none with greater pleasure scarce any one with so much confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes as the bearer colonel conway a native of ireland advanced in the service by his merit <\s>
<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>
<s> this gentleman has seen much service his principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops and preparing for action and from his abilities as well as from his long experience he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in france <\s>

<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
<s> the ministry were pleased to say that i had placed the whole in the most striking point of view and they believed with great justice <\s>
<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>
<s> flour is now 22 and 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>

<s> i should never have completed what i have but for the generous the indefatigable and spirited exertions of monsieur beaumarchais to whom the united states are on every account greatly indebted more so than to any other person on this side the water he is greatly in advance for stores clothing and the like and therefore i am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances <\s>

<s> this i have confidently assured his uncle he will receive from you and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score and in whatever department you may fix him that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part <\s>
<s> a particular account of the stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel but may go by the next or some succeeding one as several will sail after this on the same errand <\s>
<s> let me by every letter urge on you the sending in season a quantity of tobacco of rice and flour or wheat <\s>
<s> these are articles which cannot fail and are capital ones twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in france besides the demand in other kingdoms <\s>
<s> i think monsieur beaumarchais wrote you under the firm of _hortalez co if so you will address him in the same style but as i must probably remain here until the arrival of these articles i can regulate that on the arrival of your despatches <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have recommended several officers to your service but none with greater pleasure scarce any one with so much confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes as the bearer colonel conway a native of ireland advanced in the service by his merit <\s>
<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>
<s> this gentleman has seen much service his principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops and preparing for action and from his abilities as well as from his long experience he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in france <\s>
<s> such an officer must be i conceive of very great service and his generously confiding in the honorable congress for such rank and appointments as they shall confer entitles him still more to our immediate attention and notice <\s>
<s> i have assured him of the most favorable reception and am confident he will receive the same <\s>
<s> colonel conway takes with him some young officers of his own training who know well the english language and may be of immediate service in the same important department of discipline <\s>

<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
<s> the ministry were pleased to say that i had placed the whole in the most striking point of view and they believed with great justice <\s>
<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>
<s> flour is now 22 and 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>
<s> the prizes must finally be brought to you for condemnation and the principal advantage will remain with you <\s>

<s> i should never have completed what i have but for the generous the indefatigable and spirited exertions of monsieur beaumarchais to whom the united states are on every account greatly indebted more so than to any other person on this side the water he is greatly in advance for stores clothing and the like and therefore i am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances <\s>
<s> he wrote you by mr mccrery and will write you again by this conveyance <\s>
<s> a nephew of his a young gentleman of family education and spirit makes a voyage to america with monsieur du coudray and is ambitious of serving his first campaigns in your service <\s>
<s> i recommend him therefore to your particular patronage and protection as well on account of the great merits of his uncle as on that of his being a youth of spirit and genius and just entering the world in a foreign country he needs protection and paternal advice to countenance and encourage him <\s>
<s> this i have confidently assured his uncle he will receive from you and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score and in whatever department you may fix him that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part <\s>
<s> a particular account of the stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel but may go by the next or some succeeding one as several will sail after this on the same errand <\s>
<s> let me by every letter urge on you the sending in season a quantity of tobacco of rice and flour or wheat <\s>
<s> these are articles which cannot fail and are capital ones twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in france besides the demand in other kingdoms <\s>
<s> i think monsieur beaumarchais wrote you under the firm of _hortalez co if so you will address him in the same style but as i must probably remain here until the arrival of these articles i can regulate that on the arrival of your despatches <\s>
<s> i have advised these stores being shipped for some of the new england ports northeast of newport first and if failing of making a port there to stand for the capes of the delaware or for charleston in south carolina as the most likely route to avoid interception <\s>
<s> i cannot in a letter do full justice to monsieur beaumarchais for his great address and assiduity in our cause i can only say he appears to have undertaken it on great and liberal principles and has in the pursuit made it his own <\s>
<s> his interest and influence which are great have been exerted to the utmost in the cause of the united states and i hope the consequences will equal his wishes <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have recommended several officers to your service but none with greater pleasure scarce any one with so much confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes as the bearer colonel conway a native of ireland advanced in the service by his merit <\s>
<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>
<s> this gentleman has seen much service his principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops and preparing for action and from his abilities as well as from his long experience he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in france <\s>
<s> such an officer must be i conceive of very great service and his generously confiding in the honorable congress for such rank and appointments as they shall confer entitles him still more to our immediate attention and notice <\s>
<s> i have assured him of the most favorable reception and am confident he will receive the same <\s>
<s> colonel conway takes with him some young officers of his own training who know well the english language and may be of immediate service in the same important department of discipline <\s>
<s> as colonel conway has been long in service though in prime of life i am confident you will not think it right he should rank under those who have served under him in this kingdom which will not be the case if he fills the place of an adjutant or brigadier general for which i am well assured he is every way well qualified <\s>
<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>
<s> should the honorable congress have a new body of troops to form in any part of the continent this gentleman might take the direction of them to very great advantage and may i presume be equally so in the station you may appoint him in the main army <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> to the committee of secret correspondence <\s>
<s> paris 1st december 1776 <\s>
<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
<s> the ministry were pleased to say that i had placed the whole in the most striking point of view and they believed with great justice <\s>
<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>
<s> flour is now 22 and 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>
<s> the prizes must finally be brought to you for condemnation and the principal advantage will remain with you <\s>
<s> i have written largely and on many subjects yet fear i have omitted some things deserving attention <\s>
<s> du coudray will be with you by the receipt of this with stores complete for thirty thousand men <\s>
<s> the extraordinary exertions of this gentleman and his character entitle him to much from the united states and i hope the sum i have stipulated with him for will not be considered extravagant when you consider it is much less than is given in europe <\s>
<s> baron de kalb i consider an important acquisition as are many other of the officers whose characters i may not stay to particularize but refer you to baron de kalb who speaks english and to mr rogers who is generally acquainted with them <\s>
<s> as to sea officers they are not so easily obtained yet some good ones may be had and in particular two one of whom i have already mentioned the other is quite his equal with some other advantages he was first lieutenant of a man of war round the world with captain cook and has since had a ship but wants to leave this for other service where he may make a settlement and establish a family <\s>
<s> these two officers would engage a number of younger ones <\s>
<s> should they embark i send herewith the plans of one of them for burning ships <\s>
<s> i submit it to the honorable congress who are sensible of the variety and magnitude of the objects before me whether it is not of importance to despatch some one of its body to assist me or to take a part by his own immediate direction <\s>
<s> such a person known to possess your fullest confidence would by his advice and assistance be of service to me though he were and i were occasionally at madrid or berlin <\s>

<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>
<s> this gentleman has seen much service his principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops and preparing for action and from his abilities as well as from his long experience he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in france <\s>

<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>

<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>

<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>

<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>

<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
<s> the ministry were pleased to say that i had placed the whole in the most striking point of view and they believed with great justice <\s>
<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>
<s> flour is now 22 and 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>
<s> the prizes must finally be brought to you for condemnation and the principal advantage will remain with you <\s>
<s> i have written largely and on many subjects yet fear i have omitted some things deserving attention <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have recommended several officers to your service but none with greater pleasure scarce any one with so much confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes as the bearer colonel conway a native of ireland advanced in the service by his merit <\s>
<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>
<s> this gentleman has seen much service his principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops and preparing for action and from his abilities as well as from his long experience he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in france <\s>
<s> such an officer must be i conceive of very great service and his generously confiding in the honorable congress for such rank and appointments as they shall confer entitles him still more to our immediate attention and notice <\s>
<s> i have assured him of the most favorable reception and am confident he will receive the same <\s>
<s> colonel conway takes with him some young officers of his own training who know well the english language and may be of immediate service in the same important department of discipline <\s>
<s> as colonel conway has been long in service though in prime of life i am confident you will not think it right he should rank under those who have served under him in this kingdom which will not be the case if he fills the place of an adjutant or brigadier general for which i am well assured he is every way well qualified <\s>
<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>
<s> should the honorable congress have a new body of troops to form in any part of the continent this gentleman might take the direction of them to very great advantage and may i presume be equally so in the station you may appoint him in the main army <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>

<s> paris 1st december 1776 <\s>
<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
<s> the ministry were pleased to say that i had placed the whole in the most striking point of view and they believed with great justice <\s>
<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>
<s> flour is now 22 and 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>
<s> the prizes must finally be brought to you for condemnation and the principal advantage will remain with you <\s>
<s> i have written largely and on many subjects yet fear i have omitted some things deserving attention <\s>
<s> du coudray will be with you by the receipt of this with stores complete for thirty thousand men <\s>
<s> the extraordinary exertions of this gentleman and his character entitle him to much from the united states and i hope the sum i have stipulated with him for will not be considered extravagant when you consider it is much less than is given in europe <\s>
<s> baron de kalb i consider an important acquisition as are many other of the officers whose characters i may not stay to particularize but refer you to baron de kalb who speaks english and to mr rogers who is generally acquainted with them <\s>
<s> as to sea officers they are not so easily obtained yet some good ones may be had and in particular two one of whom i have already mentioned the other is quite his equal with some other advantages he was first lieutenant of a man of war round the world with captain cook and has since had a ship but wants to leave this for other service where he may make a settlement and establish a family <\s>
<s> these two officers would engage a number of younger ones <\s>
<s> should they embark i send herewith the plans of one of them for burning ships <\s>
<s> i submit it to the honorable congress who are sensible of the variety and magnitude of the objects before me whether it is not of importance to despatch some one of its body to assist me or to take a part by his own immediate direction <\s>
<s> such a person known to possess your fullest confidence would by his advice and assistance be of service to me though he were and i were occasionally at madrid or berlin <\s>
<s> having obtained some knowledge of the language and an acquaintance with those in power here as well as others such abilities as i have which are ever devoted to my country can be employed here to the best advantage at present but i submit my thoughts to your determination and am with great truth and sincerity silas deane <\s>

<s> gentlemen the several letters you will receive with this will give you some idea of the situation i have been in for some months past though after all i must refer you to mr rogers for particulars on some subjects <\s>
<s> i should never have completed what i have but for the generous the indefatigable and spirited exertions of monsieur beaumarchais to whom the united states are on every account greatly indebted more so than to any other person on this side the water he is greatly in advance for stores clothing and the like and therefore i am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances <\s>
<s> he wrote you by mr mccrery and will write you again by this conveyance <\s>
<s> a nephew of his a young gentleman of family education and spirit makes a voyage to america with monsieur du coudray and is ambitious of serving his first campaigns in your service <\s>
<s> i recommend him therefore to your particular patronage and protection as well on account of the great merits of his uncle as on that of his being a youth of spirit and genius and just entering the world in a foreign country he needs protection and paternal advice to countenance and encourage him <\s>
<s> this i have confidently assured his uncle he will receive from you and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score and in whatever department you may fix him that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part <\s>
<s> a particular account of the stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel but may go by the next or some succeeding one as several will sail after this on the same errand <\s>
<s> let me by every letter urge on you the sending in season a quantity of tobacco of rice and flour or wheat <\s>
<s> these are articles which cannot fail and are capital ones twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in france besides the demand in other kingdoms <\s>
<s> i think monsieur beaumarchais wrote you under the firm of _hortalez co if so you will address him in the same style but as i must probably remain here until the arrival of these articles i can regulate that on the arrival of your despatches <\s>
<s> i have advised these stores being shipped for some of the new england ports northeast of newport first and if failing of making a port there to stand for the capes of the delaware or for charleston in south carolina as the most likely route to avoid interception <\s>
<s> i cannot in a letter do full justice to monsieur beaumarchais for his great address and assiduity in our cause i can only say he appears to have undertaken it on great and liberal principles and has in the pursuit made it his own <\s>

<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>

<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>

<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
<s> the ministry were pleased to say that i had placed the whole in the most striking point of view and they believed with great justice <\s>
<s> i could wish to send you copies of these but i have no assistant except occasionally and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one who might deserve confidence and those who are deserving are but few <\s>
<s> bread will be scarce before the next harvest <\s>
<s> flour is now 22 and 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> and tobacco is as i have before mentioned and i promise myself you will not let slip so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage <\s>
<s> in expectation of your sending over frigates to convoy your ships and of your giving instructions on what i have written you of operations in these seas i design being at bordeaux in march when i shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair but at any rate send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in europe under your flag <\s>
<s> the prizes must finally be brought to you for condemnation and the principal advantage will remain with you <\s>
<s> i have written largely and on many subjects yet fear i have omitted some things deserving attention <\s>
<s> du coudray will be with you by the receipt of this with stores complete for thirty thousand men <\s>
<s> the extraordinary exertions of this gentleman and his character entitle him to much from the united states and i hope the sum i have stipulated with him for will not be considered extravagant when you consider it is much less than is given in europe <\s>
<s> baron de kalb i consider an important acquisition as are many other of the officers whose characters i may not stay to particularize but refer you to baron de kalb who speaks english and to mr rogers who is generally acquainted with them <\s>
<s> as to sea officers they are not so easily obtained yet some good ones may be had and in particular two one of whom i have already mentioned the other is quite his equal with some other advantages he was first lieutenant of a man of war round the world with captain cook and has since had a ship but wants to leave this for other service where he may make a settlement and establish a family <\s>
<s> these two officers would engage a number of younger ones <\s>
<s> should they embark i send herewith the plans of one of them for burning ships <\s>
<s> i submit it to the honorable congress who are sensible of the variety and magnitude of the objects before me whether it is not of importance to despatch some one of its body to assist me or to take a part by his own immediate direction <\s>
<s> such a person known to possess your fullest confidence would by his advice and assistance be of service to me though he were and i were occasionally at madrid or berlin <\s>
<s> having obtained some knowledge of the language and an acquaintance with those in power here as well as others such abilities as i have which are ever devoted to my country can be employed here to the best advantage at present but i submit my thoughts to your determination and am with great truth and sincerity silas deane <\s>

<s> paris 29th november 1776 <\s>
<s> gentlemen the several letters you will receive with this will give you some idea of the situation i have been in for some months past though after all i must refer you to mr rogers for particulars on some subjects <\s>
<s> i should never have completed what i have but for the generous the indefatigable and spirited exertions of monsieur beaumarchais to whom the united states are on every account greatly indebted more so than to any other person on this side the water he is greatly in advance for stores clothing and the like and therefore i am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances <\s>
<s> he wrote you by mr mccrery and will write you again by this conveyance <\s>
<s> a nephew of his a young gentleman of family education and spirit makes a voyage to america with monsieur du coudray and is ambitious of serving his first campaigns in your service <\s>
<s> i recommend him therefore to your particular patronage and protection as well on account of the great merits of his uncle as on that of his being a youth of spirit and genius and just entering the world in a foreign country he needs protection and paternal advice to countenance and encourage him <\s>
<s> this i have confidently assured his uncle he will receive from you and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score and in whatever department you may fix him that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part <\s>
<s> a particular account of the stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel but may go by the next or some succeeding one as several will sail after this on the same errand <\s>
<s> let me by every letter urge on you the sending in season a quantity of tobacco of rice and flour or wheat <\s>
<s> these are articles which cannot fail and are capital ones twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in france besides the demand in other kingdoms <\s>
<s> i think monsieur beaumarchais wrote you under the firm of _hortalez co if so you will address him in the same style but as i must probably remain here until the arrival of these articles i can regulate that on the arrival of your despatches <\s>
<s> i have advised these stores being shipped for some of the new england ports northeast of newport first and if failing of making a port there to stand for the capes of the delaware or for charleston in south carolina as the most likely route to avoid interception <\s>
<s> i cannot in a letter do full justice to monsieur beaumarchais for his great address and assiduity in our cause i can only say he appears to have undertaken it on great and liberal principles and has in the pursuit made it his own <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have recommended several officers to your service but none with greater pleasure scarce any one with so much confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes as the bearer colonel conway a native of ireland advanced in the service by his merit <\s>
<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>
<s> this gentleman has seen much service his principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops and preparing for action and from his abilities as well as from his long experience he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in france <\s>

<s> i have assured him of the most favorable reception and am confident he will receive the same <\s>
<s> colonel conway takes with him some young officers of his own training who know well the english language and may be of immediate service in the same important department of discipline <\s>
<s> as colonel conway has been long in service though in prime of life i am confident you will not think it right he should rank under those who have served under him in this kingdom which will not be the case if he fills the place of an adjutant or brigadier general for which i am well assured he is every way well qualified <\s>
<s> i have advanced him as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages and told him he may rely on your granting him one of the above ranks in the continental forces <\s>

<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>

<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>

<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>

<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>

<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>

<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>

<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>

<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>

<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>

<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>

<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>

<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>

<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>

<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>
<s> it may be objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure <\s>
<s> i reply it is the most favorable that can happen <\s>
<s> you want money and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it even the most certain in the world that of land security you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of europe in your favor <\s>
<s> i have spoken with many persons of good sense on this subject which makes me the more sanguine <\s>
<s> as to a loan i will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that only adding or rather repeating what i have in a former letter written that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made to the officers and soldiers serving in the present war in which regard should be had to the wounded the widows or children of those that fall and to the term or number of campaigns each one serves <\s>
<s> this will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting for freehold and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound <\s>
<s> it has been a question with me at times whether if our commerce were open and protected the colonies would be wise in negotiating a loan <\s>
<s> but on considering that before this war the imports of the colonies just about balanced their exports i cannot think it possible with the most rigid economy supposing exports as large as formerly to make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war and consequently a debt must be contracted by the public somewhere <\s>
<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>

<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>

<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>

<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>

<s> his views are to establish himself and his growing family in america consequently he becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles <\s>

<s> gentlemen among the many important objects which employ your whole attention i presume ways and means for defraying the expenses of the present war have a capital place <\s>
<s> you will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which they deserve <\s>
<s> in the first place to emit more bills will be rather dangerous for money or whatever passes for such when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state must lose its value and the present circumscribed state of the american commerce is perhaps within the amount of your emissions already made <\s>
<s> your bills therefore must be borrowed of individuals by the public at interest or those already emitted paid off by taxes and new emissions <\s>
<s> some colonies may now be content with a tax but it is most probably quite out of the power of some and a measure rather impolitic in a majority of the colonies or states _durante bello <\s>
<s> to effect any considerable loan in europe is perhaps difficult <\s>
<s> it has not been tried and on the probability of succeeding in this i will give my sentiments hereafter <\s>
<s> it is obvious that let the loan be made when it will it must have a day fixed for payment and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose <\s>
<s> the relying on future taxes is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it and enjoying the remainder of their fortunes clear of incumberance it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in pushing it on with vigor <\s>
<s> a loan of six or eight millions or a debt of that amount will probably enable you to finish the war <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be negotiated on terms which i will propose hereafter but previously let it be attended to that the present contest has engaged the attention of all europe and more it will eventually interest all europe in favor of the united states the russians in the north and portugal in the south excepted i make no consideration of the little mercenary electorates in my calculation <\s>
<s> the mercantile part of the other powers are convinced where their interest appears so evidently engaged <\s>
<s> the political part are sensible of the importance of enlarging their own naval concerns and force and of checking that of great britain <\s>
<s> the good and wise part the lovers of liberty and human happiness look forward to the establishment of american freedom and independence as an event which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic power daily gaining ground in every part of europe <\s>
<s> from those and other considerations on which i need not be minute emigrations from europe will be prodigious immediately on the establishment of american independency <\s>
<s> the consequence of this must be the rise of the lands already settled and a demand for new or uncultivated land on this demand i conceive a certain fund may now be fixed <\s>
<s> you may smile and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable but at the same time you must be sensible that your wants are real and if others can be induced to relieve them it is indifferent to you whether they have a consideration in hand or in prospect <\s>
<s> i trace the river ohio from its junction to its head thence north to lake erie on the south and west of that lake to fort detroit which is in the latitude of boston thence a west course to the mississippi and return to the place of my departure <\s>
<s> these three lines of near one thousand miles each include an immense territory in a fine climate well watered and by accounts exceedingly fertile it is not inhabited by any europeans of consequence and the tribes of indians are inconsiderable and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation <\s>
<s> to this i ask your attention as a resource amply adequate under proper regulations for defraying the whole expense of the war and the sums necessary to be given the indians in purchase of the native right <\s>
<s> but to give this land value inhabitants are necessary <\s>
<s> i therefore propose in the first place that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth of the ohio between that and the mississippi equal to two hundred miles square to a company formed indiscriminately of europeans and americans which company should form a distinct state confederated with and under the general regulations of the united states general of america <\s>
<s> that the congress of the united states shall out of such grant reserve the defraying or discharging of the public debts or expenses one fifth part of all the lands mines c <\s>
<s> within said tract to be disposed of by the congress in such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate the said one fifth to be sequestered out of every grant or settlement made by the company of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement <\s>
<s> the company on their part shall engage to have in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said grant and civil government regulated and supported on free and liberal principles taking therein the advice of the honorable congress of the united states <\s>
<s> they shall also from and after their having one thousand families as abovementioned contribute their proportion of the public expenses of the continent or united states according to the number of their inhabitants and shall be entitled to a voice in congress as soon as they are called on thus to contribute <\s>
<s> the company shall at all times have the preference of purchasing the continental or common interest thus reserved when it shall be offered for sale <\s>
<s> the company shall consist on giving the patent or grant of at least one hundred persons <\s>
<s> these are the outlines of a proposed grant which you see contains more than 25,000 000 acres of land the one fifth of which if a settlement is carried on vigorously will soon be of prodigious value <\s>
<s> at this time a company might be formed in france germany c <\s>
<s> who would form a stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to defray the expense of this settlement <\s>
<s> by such a step you in the first place extend the circle of your connexion and influence <\s>
<s> you increase the number of your inhabitants proportionably lessen the common expenses and have in the reserve a fund for public exigencies <\s>
<s> further as this company would be in a great degree commercial the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on or near them within the above extensive description and future grants might admit of larger reserves amply sufficient for defraying the expenses of the war and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes <\s>

<s> the question which naturally arises is whether it be most prudent to contract this debt at home or abroad <\s>
<s> to me it admits of no doubt that the latter is to be preferred on every account <\s>
<s> if you can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in europe than in america you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie that of their immediate interest to support your cause <\s>
<s> there are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode <\s>
<s> the next question is where can you borrow and what security can you offer <\s>
<s> holland is at present the centre of money and credit for europe and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount that could the nations in europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this _republic of mammon it would as effectually ruin it as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes <\s>
<s> would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of the different kingdoms consult the books of the dutch banks <\s>
<s> this kingdom france has been in bad credit from the villainy of a late comptroller general as it is said one abbe terrai against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written <\s>
<s> he was succeeded by the much esteemed mons <\s>
<s> turgot and stocks rose and a commission was given to a banker a correspondent of mine in amsterdam to negotiate a loan but the dismission of mons <\s>
<s> turgot and the indifferent opinion which monied men at least had of his successor mons <\s>
