<s> no news arriving though we received letters from you of any commissioner being actually appointed for prussia and the necessity of a good understanding with that court in order to obtain speedily a port in the northern seas appearing more and more every day on various occasions he concluded with our approbation to set out for berlin which he did about a week since and we have reason to hope good effects from that journey <\s>
<s> the points principally in view are besides the acknowledgment of american independency an open port for german commerce and the permission of fitting out armed vessels to annoy the enemy's northern trade and of bringing in and selling our prizes <\s>
<s> if these points can be obtained we are assured we might soon have a formidable squadron there and accumulate seamen to a great amount <\s>
<s> the want of such a free port appears in the late instance of captain cunningham's arrest at dunkirk with the prizes he brought in <\s>
<s> for though the fitting out may be covered and concealed by various pretences so as at least to be winked at by government here because those pretences afford a good excuse for not preventing it yet the bringing in of prizes by a vessel so fitted out is so notorious an act and so contrary to treaties that if suffered must occasion an immediate war <\s>
<s> cunningham will however through favor be discharged with his vessel as we are given to understand but we must put up with the loss of the prizes which being reclaimed will be restored 36 this is an occasion of triumph to our enemies which we must suffer them to enjoy for the present assured as we are by the most substantial proofs of the friendship of this court and of spain which we are persuaded will soon manifest itself to the whole world <\s>

<s> we propose to have as many sets made with these saddles as will mount a squadron but shall omit saddles for the rest as they will take up too much room in the vessels and can soon be made with you <\s>

<s> we observe your remarks on the timorousness of the french merchants respecting the formation of trading companies which you say is occasioned by the change and fluctuation of news <\s>
<s> that the spirit for trade will always be governed by the rise and fall of military strength is a maxim always to be admitted in the first attempts to establish a commerce between any two nations because success in war is supposed to give security or protection to it <\s>
<s> but this timidity ceases naturally as soon as a trade is opened for losing or gaining after that equally produces a spirit of adventuring further <\s>
<s> therefore we wish to enter into a trade with them as soon as possible because as nothing can abridge or prevent their profits but the enemy's making prizes of their ships the consequence will be that they will either be encouraged by the gain or aggravated by the loss to come to a serious understanding with the court of britain <\s>
<s> we advise you to be constantly holding up the great advantages which the crown and commerce would receive by their possessing themselves of the west indies and we trust to your wisdom in making all the use possible of the english newspapers as a channel through which to counteract the tide of folly and falsehood of which you complain and rest assured that every material circumstance either for or against will be despatched to you with the utmost expedition <\s>
<s> by information from new york it appears that the more discerning part of the english generals begin to give up the thought of conquest and of consequence the fear of totally losing the trade of america must accompany the despair of arms therefore we conceive that the english newspapers are now calculated to deter the french from beginning to taste the sweets of our trade <\s>
<s> their falsehoods rightly understood are the barometers of their fears and in proportion as the political atmosphere presses downward the spirit of faction is obliged to rise <\s>
<s> we wish it to be understood that we pay too much respect to the wisdom of the french cabinet to suppose that they can be influenced by such efforts of visible despair and that we have too much reverence for the honor of the american congress to prostitute its authority by filling our own newspapers with the same kind of invented tales which characterise the london gazette <\s>
<s> we observe that general howe in his letter to the administration printed in the london gazette of december 30th apologizes for not having written to them since his taking possession of new york nearly three months <\s>
<s> here is the proper field to speculate on silence because this business is conquest ours defence and repulse and because likewise he has the sea more open to him than we have had he any thing to send that would please <\s>

<s> the points principally in view are besides the acknowledgment of american independency an open port for german commerce and the permission of fitting out armed vessels to annoy the enemy's northern trade and of bringing in and selling our prizes <\s>
<s> if these points can be obtained we are assured we might soon have a formidable squadron there and accumulate seamen to a great amount <\s>
<s> the want of such a free port appears in the late instance of captain cunningham's arrest at dunkirk with the prizes he brought in <\s>
<s> for though the fitting out may be covered and concealed by various pretences so as at least to be winked at by government here because those pretences afford a good excuse for not preventing it yet the bringing in of prizes by a vessel so fitted out is so notorious an act and so contrary to treaties that if suffered must occasion an immediate war <\s>
<s> cunningham will however through favor be discharged with his vessel as we are given to understand but we must put up with the loss of the prizes which being reclaimed will be restored 36 this is an occasion of triumph to our enemies which we must suffer them to enjoy for the present assured as we are by the most substantial proofs of the friendship of this court and of spain which we are persuaded will soon manifest itself to the whole world <\s>
<s> the latter has already remitted to us a large sum of money as you will see by mr lee's letters 37 and continues to send cargoes of supplies of which you have herewith sundry accounts <\s>

<s> we propose to have as many sets made with these saddles as will mount a squadron but shall omit saddles for the rest as they will take up too much room in the vessels and can soon be made with you <\s>

<s> the large brass cannon are not to be had here we have been treating with a swedish merchant about them but find too many difficulties in getting them from that country so that finally understanding you have some founders with you and that we can have others to go from hence we conclude to send two artists in that way with the metal to cast the number wanted omitting only the field pieces of which we suppose you have by this time a number sufficient <\s>

<s> gentlemen this letter is intended to be delivered to you by john paul jones an active and brave commander in our navy who has already performed signal services in vessels of little force and in reward for his zeal we have directed him to go on board the amphitrite a french ship of twenty guns that brought in a valuable cargo of stores from messrs hortalez co <\s>
<s> and with her to repair to france <\s>
<s> he takes with him his commission some officers and men so that we hope he will under that sanction make some good prizes with the amphitrite but our design of sending him is with the approbation of congress that you may purchase one of those fine frigates that mr deane writes us you can get and invest him with the command thereof as soon as possible <\s>
<s> we hope you may not delay this business one moment but purchase in such port or place in europe as it can be done with most convenience and despatch a fine fast sailing frigate or larger ship <\s>

<s> you will assign him some good house or agent to supply him with every thing necessary to get the ship speedily and well equipped and manned somebody that will bestir himself vigorously in the business and never quit until it is accomplished <\s>
<s> if you have any plan or service to be performed in europe by such a ship that you think will be more for the interest and honor of these states than sending her out directly captain jones is instructed to obey your orders and to save repetition let him lay before you the instructions we have given him and furnish you with a copy thereof you can then judge what will be necessary for you to direct him in and whatsoever you do will be approved as it will undoubtedly tend to promote the public service of this country <\s>

<s> no news arriving though we received letters from you of any commissioner being actually appointed for prussia and the necessity of a good understanding with that court in order to obtain speedily a port in the northern seas appearing more and more every day on various occasions he concluded with our approbation to set out for berlin which he did about a week since and we have reason to hope good effects from that journey <\s>
<s> the points principally in view are besides the acknowledgment of american independency an open port for german commerce and the permission of fitting out armed vessels to annoy the enemy's northern trade and of bringing in and selling our prizes <\s>
<s> if these points can be obtained we are assured we might soon have a formidable squadron there and accumulate seamen to a great amount <\s>
<s> the want of such a free port appears in the late instance of captain cunningham's arrest at dunkirk with the prizes he brought in <\s>
<s> for though the fitting out may be covered and concealed by various pretences so as at least to be winked at by government here because those pretences afford a good excuse for not preventing it yet the bringing in of prizes by a vessel so fitted out is so notorious an act and so contrary to treaties that if suffered must occasion an immediate war <\s>

<s> philadelphia 2d may 1777 <\s>
<s> gentlemen your despatches dated february the 6th and 8th were safely received by us about the middle of april <\s>
<s> we observe your remarks on the timorousness of the french merchants respecting the formation of trading companies which you say is occasioned by the change and fluctuation of news <\s>
<s> that the spirit for trade will always be governed by the rise and fall of military strength is a maxim always to be admitted in the first attempts to establish a commerce between any two nations because success in war is supposed to give security or protection to it <\s>
<s> but this timidity ceases naturally as soon as a trade is opened for losing or gaining after that equally produces a spirit of adventuring further <\s>
<s> therefore we wish to enter into a trade with them as soon as possible because as nothing can abridge or prevent their profits but the enemy's making prizes of their ships the consequence will be that they will either be encouraged by the gain or aggravated by the loss to come to a serious understanding with the court of britain <\s>
<s> we advise you to be constantly holding up the great advantages which the crown and commerce would receive by their possessing themselves of the west indies and we trust to your wisdom in making all the use possible of the english newspapers as a channel through which to counteract the tide of folly and falsehood of which you complain and rest assured that every material circumstance either for or against will be despatched to you with the utmost expedition <\s>
<s> by information from new york it appears that the more discerning part of the english generals begin to give up the thought of conquest and of consequence the fear of totally losing the trade of america must accompany the despair of arms therefore we conceive that the english newspapers are now calculated to deter the french from beginning to taste the sweets of our trade <\s>
<s> their falsehoods rightly understood are the barometers of their fears and in proportion as the political atmosphere presses downward the spirit of faction is obliged to rise <\s>
<s> we wish it to be understood that we pay too much respect to the wisdom of the french cabinet to suppose that they can be influenced by such efforts of visible despair and that we have too much reverence for the honor of the american congress to prostitute its authority by filling our own newspapers with the same kind of invented tales which characterise the london gazette <\s>
<s> we observe that general howe in his letter to the administration printed in the london gazette of december 30th apologizes for not having written to them since his taking possession of new york nearly three months <\s>
<s> here is the proper field to speculate on silence because this business is conquest ours defence and repulse and because likewise he has the sea more open to him than we have had he any thing to send that would please <\s>

<s> our troops have been under inocculation for the smallpox with good success which we hope will be a means of preserving them from fevers in summer however it will frustrate one cannibal scheme of our enemies who have constantly fought us with that disease by introducing it among our troops <\s>
<s> when we look back to the beginning of last december and see our army reduced to between two and three thousand men occasioned by the expiration of the time for which they were enlisted we feel exceedingly happy in contemplating the agreeable condition and prospect our affairs are now in <\s>
<s> we have since that period reduced the enemy more than our whole army at that time amounted to and scarce a day passes in which they do not suffer either by skirmishes or desertions <\s>
<s> the congress have it in contemplation to remove the garrison from the present fort in the district of ticonderoga to fort independence in the same district which they judge will command that pass with greater advantage and is a much healthier situation <\s>
<s> we mention this as the enemy will probably give an air of triumph to the evacuation should it be done <\s>
<s> the distance between the two is about a quarter of a mile <\s>
<s> as general howe is preparing a bridge of boats we think it possible that he might by a sudden and forced march reach this city but we are clearly of opinion that he would be ruined by the event and though we are not under much apprehension of such a movement yet we think it proper to give you the case with our opinion thereon <\s>
