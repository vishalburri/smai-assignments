<s> that in doing this he might probably soon be engaged in a war with all the expenses risks and damages usually attending it yet he should not expect any compensation from us on that account nor pretend that he acted wholly for our sakes since besides his real good will to us and our cause it was manifestly the interest of france that the power of england should be diminished by our separation from it <\s>
<s> he should moreover not so much as insist that if he engaged in a war with england on our account we should not make a separate peace he would have us be at full liberty to make a peace for ourselves whenever good and advantageous terms were offered to us <\s>
<s> the only condition he should require and rely on would be this that we in no peace to be made with england should give up our independence and return to the obedience of that government <\s>
<s> that as soon as the courier returned from spain with the concurrence expected the affair would be proceeded in and concluded and of this we might give the congress the strongest assurances in our despatches only cautioning them to keep the whole for the present a dead secret as spain had three reasons for not immediately declaring her money fleet not yet come home her brazil army and fleet the same and her peace with portugal not yet quite completed but these obstacles would probably soon be removed <\s>

<s> that in doing this he might probably soon be engaged in a war with all the expenses risks and damages usually attending it yet he should not expect any compensation from us on that account nor pretend that he acted wholly for our sakes since besides his real good will to us and our cause it was manifestly the interest of france that the power of england should be diminished by our separation from it <\s>

<s> that in doing this he might probably soon be engaged in a war with all the expenses risks and damages usually attending it yet he should not expect any compensation from us on that account nor pretend that he acted wholly for our sakes since besides his real good will to us and our cause it was manifestly the interest of france that the power of england should be diminished by our separation from it <\s>
<s> he should moreover not so much as insist that if he engaged in a war with england on our account we should not make a separate peace he would have us be at full liberty to make a peace for ourselves whenever good and advantageous terms were offered to us <\s>
<s> the only condition he should require and rely on would be this that we in no peace to be made with england should give up our independence and return to the obedience of that government <\s>

<s> you will readily imagine gentlemen that our extensive operations have produced great expense as our inexperience in war has not furnished us with that systematic economy which is so necessary and so well understood by european nations <\s>
