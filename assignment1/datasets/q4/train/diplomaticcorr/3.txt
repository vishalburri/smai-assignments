<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>
<s> dr bancroft was full with me in this opinion <\s>

<s> dr bancroft is returned to london and by him i wrote to mons <\s>
<s> garnier and agreed on a mode of correspondence <\s>
<s> i think your remittances in armed vessels will be much the best method and i have ordered captain morgan's sloop to be armed and should she arrive safe recommend him as one i am confident will serve the colonies with great zeal and fidelity and i have had some experience of the goodness of his temper and his abilities <\s>
<s> mr seymour his mate is also deserving of encouragement as a good seaman and of undaunted resolution <\s>
<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>

<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>

<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> were it possible i would attempt to paint to you the heart rending anxiety i have suffered in this time through a total want of intelligence my arrival here my name my lodgings and many other particulars have been reported to the british administration on which they sent orders to the british ambassador to remonstrate in high terms and to enforce their remonstrance despatched wedderburn from london and lord rochford from holland as a person of great interest and address here to counteract me <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> dr bancroft is returned to london and by him i wrote to mons <\s>
<s> garnier and agreed on a mode of correspondence <\s>

<s> mr seymour his mate is also deserving of encouragement as a good seaman and of undaunted resolution <\s>
<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>
<s> i was directed to apply for arms and clothes for 25,000 men and for 100 field pieces with ammunition and stores in proportion <\s>
<s> this i wished to get of the ministry direct but they evaded it and i am now in treaty for procuring them through the agency of mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais on a credit of eight months from the time of their delivery <\s>
<s> if i effect this as i undoubtedly shall i must rely on the remittances being made this fall and winter without fail or the credit of the colonies must suffer <\s>
<s> if i can get the arms out of the magazines and the field pieces here i hope for a much longer credit but if we send to sweden for the brass cannon the credit will not be lengthened beyond that <\s>
<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>
<s> some engineers here assert that iron is preferable to brass that is wrought iron out of which the pieces may be made lighter and to a better purpose <\s>
<s> considering the want of these pieces and the plenty of iron in america the experiment might i think be made without delay <\s>
<s> i am still in hopes of procuring an admission of the article of tobacco directly from america but the farmers-general will not offer equivalent to the risk <\s>
<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>
<s> i have now to urge a survey with respect to the contents of this letter more that is said in congress transpires and crosses the atlantic than you conceive of more than i can account for without having uncharitable thoughts of individuals still without fixing them on any one <\s>

<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> mr seymour his mate is also deserving of encouragement as a good seaman and of undaunted resolution <\s>
<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> if i effect this as i undoubtedly shall i must rely on the remittances being made this fall and winter without fail or the credit of the colonies must suffer <\s>
<s> if i can get the arms out of the magazines and the field pieces here i hope for a much longer credit but if we send to sweden for the brass cannon the credit will not be lengthened beyond that <\s>
<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>
<s> some engineers here assert that iron is preferable to brass that is wrought iron out of which the pieces may be made lighter and to a better purpose <\s>
<s> considering the want of these pieces and the plenty of iron in america the experiment might i think be made without delay <\s>
<s> i am still in hopes of procuring an admission of the article of tobacco directly from america but the farmers-general will not offer equivalent to the risk <\s>
<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>
<s> i have now to urge a survey with respect to the contents of this letter more that is said in congress transpires and crosses the atlantic than you conceive of more than i can account for without having uncharitable thoughts of individuals still without fixing them on any one <\s>
<s> i have written a short letter to mr jay on common affairs and have enclosed one to mons <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>
<s> i am with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable congress and their committee of secret correspondence c <\s>
<s> _august 1st since writing the foregoing i have been at and am of opinion that a war between portugal and spain is at the door and i have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of portugal who resides here on commercial affairs which i have most readily embraced and expect to see him again on wednesday next after which i will write you further his proposals are merely commercial as is his station but something else may be investigated <\s>
<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>
<s> my next labor will be to obtain a convoy which i do not despair of though it is a delicate question and i have only sounded at a distance yet i have no doubt of obtaining one at least off the coast of europe and the articles will be shipped as for the west india islands <\s>
<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> a considerable part of these articles are now on hand and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this day <\s>

<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>

<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>

<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>
<s> i am with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable congress and their committee of secret correspondence c <\s>
<s> _august 1st since writing the foregoing i have been at and am of opinion that a war between portugal and spain is at the door and i have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of portugal who resides here on commercial affairs which i have most readily embraced and expect to see him again on wednesday next after which i will write you further his proposals are merely commercial as is his station but something else may be investigated <\s>
<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>
<s> my next labor will be to obtain a convoy which i do not despair of though it is a delicate question and i have only sounded at a distance yet i have no doubt of obtaining one at least off the coast of europe and the articles will be shipped as for the west india islands <\s>
<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> a considerable part of these articles are now on hand and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this day <\s>

<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>

<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>

<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>
<s> i am with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable congress and their committee of secret correspondence c <\s>
<s> _august 1st since writing the foregoing i have been at and am of opinion that a war between portugal and spain is at the door and i have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of portugal who resides here on commercial affairs which i have most readily embraced and expect to see him again on wednesday next after which i will write you further his proposals are merely commercial as is his station but something else may be investigated <\s>
<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>
<s> my next labor will be to obtain a convoy which i do not despair of though it is a delicate question and i have only sounded at a distance yet i have no doubt of obtaining one at least off the coast of europe and the articles will be shipped as for the west india islands <\s>
<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> a considerable part of these articles are now on hand and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this day <\s>

<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>

<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>

<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>
<s> i am with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable congress and their committee of secret correspondence c <\s>
<s> _august 1st since writing the foregoing i have been at and am of opinion that a war between portugal and spain is at the door and i have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of portugal who resides here on commercial affairs which i have most readily embraced and expect to see him again on wednesday next after which i will write you further his proposals are merely commercial as is his station but something else may be investigated <\s>
<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>
<s> my next labor will be to obtain a convoy which i do not despair of though it is a delicate question and i have only sounded at a distance yet i have no doubt of obtaining one at least off the coast of europe and the articles will be shipped as for the west india islands <\s>
<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> a considerable part of these articles are now on hand and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this day <\s>

<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>

<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>

<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>
<s> i am with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable congress and their committee of secret correspondence c <\s>
<s> _august 1st since writing the foregoing i have been at and am of opinion that a war between portugal and spain is at the door and i have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of portugal who resides here on commercial affairs which i have most readily embraced and expect to see him again on wednesday next after which i will write you further his proposals are merely commercial as is his station but something else may be investigated <\s>
<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>
<s> my next labor will be to obtain a convoy which i do not despair of though it is a delicate question and i have only sounded at a distance yet i have no doubt of obtaining one at least off the coast of europe and the articles will be shipped as for the west india islands <\s>
<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> a considerable part of these articles are now on hand and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this day <\s>

<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>

<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>

<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>

<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>

<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>

<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>

<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>

<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>

<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>

<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>

<s> thus freely do men think and write in a country long since deprived of the essentials of liberty as i was favored with a sight of the letter and permitted to make this extract i thought it worth sending you as a key to the sentiments of some of the leading men <\s>
<s> i must again remind you of my situation here the bills designed for my use are protested and expenses rising fast in consequence of the business on my hands which i may on no account neglect and a small douceur though i have been sparing in that way is sometimes of the utmost importance <\s>
<s> the quantity of stores to be shipped will amount to a large sum the very charge on them will be great for which i am the only responsible person <\s>

<s> i mention this case in confidence and pray that in future some regulation may be made on this subject and that vessels coming out may be directed to apply to me as their agent or owner at least and i will procure in the different ports houses of known reputation to transact their business <\s>

<s> i wrote you from bermuda on the subject of seizing and fortifying that island <\s>
<s> i am well informed the british ministry have had it in contemplation and propose doing it next spring <\s>
<s> i most readily embraced this safe way of corresponding and sent a letter i had before written with an addition on this subject a copy of which is enclosed <\s>
<s> i have thus given you the heads of my negotiation to this time july 20th and will not take up your time in making remarks on it and the prospect before me which are obvious but inform you of the plan i mean to pursue in the execution of my commission and hint some methods by which i think i may be enabled to complete every part of it to your satisfaction and the relief of my country which is all my wish and the extent of my most ambitious hopes <\s>
<s> i go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency without which little can be effected publicly with it almost every thing we can wish for <\s>
<s> it is by no means probable that europe will long remain in a state of peace the disputes between portugal and spain are on the point of producing an open rupture the former relies on england the latter will look to this kingdom and has already applied to this court on the subject <\s>
<s> nothing but the division of poland has taken the king of prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by great britain at the close of the last war <\s>
<s> he has now completed his part of that extraordinary work and i am well informed listens with pleasure to the dispute between the united colonies and great britain <\s>
<s> he is ambitious of becoming a maritime power and is already in possession of the capital ports on the baltic but without commerce it is impossible to effect the design and no commerce can put him so directly in the road as the american <\s>
<s> the consumption of coffee sugar and other west india productions increases fast in the north of europe and it must be his interest at least to supply his own dominions <\s>
<s> in case of a war in europe france spain and prussia might be brought into one interest and the emperor of germany is too closely connected with his majesty of france to take part against them after which great britain having her whole force employed in america there could be nothing on the one hand to prevent spain and france from reducing portugal to a submission to the former nor from prussia and france subduing and incorporating into their own dominions hanover and the other little mercenary electorates which lie between them and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in europe <\s>
<s> with respect to russia it is as closely allied to prussia as to great britain and may be expected to be master in the contest <\s>
<s> denmark and sweden are a balance for each other and opposites <\s>
<s> not to enlarge on this plan at present i have only to suggest that an application to the king of prussia will do no harm and may be attended with good and great consequences the prussian ambassador at this court and at that of london may be sounded on the subject <\s>
<s> but my powers and instructions are so limited that i can by no means take such a step yet when i see great britain exerting her whole force and that of her allies and courting every power in europe to aid her i can but wish she may be counteracted in her own system and by having employ found for her in europe bring her to leave america in peace and i think myself bound in duty to hint at what to me seems the most probable means <\s>
<s> dr bancroft was full with me in this opinion <\s>
<s> chaumont a very wealthy person and intendant for providing clothes c <\s>
<s> for the french army has offered me a credit on account of the colonies to the amount of one million of livres which i have accepted <\s>
<s> i have in treaty another credit which joined to this will purchase the articles directed in my instructions the credit will be until may next before which i hope remittances will be made <\s>
<s> i have purchased of said m <\s>
<s> chaumont a quantity of saltpetre at ten sous or five and one fourth per cent in order that captain morgan might not return empty <\s>
<s> as soon as i have given the orders for despatching him and settled some other matters here i design for dunkirk to ship the indian goods which i hope may arrive in season for the winter supply though i leave you to consider my situation with only about 6 or 7000 pounds to complete a contract of forty and the bills for my private expenses being protested obliged to support myself out of that capital which i labor to do with all the economy in my power <\s>
<s> dr bancroft is returned to london and by him i wrote to mons <\s>
<s> garnier and agreed on a mode of correspondence <\s>
<s> i think your remittances in armed vessels will be much the best method and i have ordered captain morgan's sloop to be armed and should she arrive safe recommend him as one i am confident will serve the colonies with great zeal and fidelity and i have had some experience of the goodness of his temper and his abilities <\s>
<s> mr seymour his mate is also deserving of encouragement as a good seaman and of undaunted resolution <\s>
<s> i am not without hopes of obtaining liberty for the armed vessels of the united colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom and also for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence but i will not venture on this until i see what effect my last memoir may have the substance of which is to shew the danger to france and spain if they permit great britain to keep so enormous a force in america and to recover the dominion of the colonies also how fully it is in their power to prevent it and by that means deprive great britain of the principal source of her wealth and force even without hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger <\s>
<s> this memoir which takes several sheets i am unable to send you a copy of as i have no one to assist me and must make out several copies for the persons to whom they are to be delivered <\s>
<s> i was directed to apply for arms and clothes for 25,000 men and for 100 field pieces with ammunition and stores in proportion <\s>
<s> this i wished to get of the ministry direct but they evaded it and i am now in treaty for procuring them through the agency of mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais on a credit of eight months from the time of their delivery <\s>
<s> if i effect this as i undoubtedly shall i must rely on the remittances being made this fall and winter without fail or the credit of the colonies must suffer <\s>
<s> if i can get the arms out of the magazines and the field pieces here i hope for a much longer credit but if we send to sweden for the brass cannon the credit will not be lengthened beyond that <\s>
<s> some new improvements have lately been made in this branch consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to those of former construction <\s>
<s> some engineers here assert that iron is preferable to brass that is wrought iron out of which the pieces may be made lighter and to a better purpose <\s>
<s> considering the want of these pieces and the plenty of iron in america the experiment might i think be made without delay <\s>
<s> i am still in hopes of procuring an admission of the article of tobacco directly from america but the farmers-general will not offer equivalent to the risk <\s>
<s> without intelligence from april to this time leaves me quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by congress and consequently i cannot without further intelligence and instructions proceed in my negotiation either with safety or honor <\s>
<s> the resolution of congress of the 15th of may is not considered by the ministry as a declaration of independence but only a previous step and until this decisive step is taken i can do little more to any purpose <\s>
<s> this taken i dare pledge myself the united colonies may obtain all the countenance and assistance they wish for in the most open and public manner and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of this kingdom i must therefore urge this measure if not already taken and that the declaration be in the most full and explicit terms <\s>
<s> merchants here would speculate deeply in the american trade could they be insured at any premium within bounds <\s>
<s> i wish to know if offices are already open and i would suggest that if the congress would take the insurance under their own direction it would give it such a proportionably greater credit that supplies would most certainly be obtained in plenty <\s>
<s> i shall be able to procure a private interview with the spanish ambassador and shall present him my memorial and am in a train which i think will carry it quite to the fountain head <\s>
<s> thus i have in a minute possibly a tedious detail mentioned every thing material on my mind which has occurred since my arrival and submit the whole to the wisdom and candor of the honorable congress observing that i had gone to the extent of my instructions and though i have been successful beyond my expectations yet i have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in motion which still want something more decisive on my part and i am confident of all that is wanting to set them so effectually moving as to roll the burthen and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its authors which if i can be the means of effecting the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases i shall be contented the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished <\s>
<s> i have now to urge a survey with respect to the contents of this letter more that is said in congress transpires and crosses the atlantic than you conceive of more than i can account for without having uncharitable thoughts of individuals still without fixing them on any one <\s>
<s> i have written a short letter to mr jay on common affairs and have enclosed one to mons <\s>
<s> longueville which i pray may be forwarded the letter is from his friends here who have heard of his being a prisoner somewhere in america <\s>
<s> dubourg has continued to render me every assistance in his power to be particular would swell this letter beyond all bounds his abilities and connexions are of the first style in this kingdom and his zeal for the cause of the united colonies is to be described only by saying that at times it is in danger of urging him beyond both in short i am every way deeply indebted to him personally for bringing me acquainted with agreeable persons of rank and character and on account of my honored constituents for assisting me to make such a favorable beginning and progress in my business <\s>
<s> i know not how affluent he may be but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation i am confident something honorable will be thought of for him <\s>
<s> i have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be sent to his and my friends in america in my private capacity mentioning our mutual friend dr franklin <\s>
<s> this i found so agreeable that i am confident some such distinction would be more acceptable than more lucrative rewards <\s>
<s> took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him he was at considerable expense in his journey i sent him from bordeaux a bill of Â £ 30 and paid his expenses in my lodgings here at parting i desired him to keep an account and when the money was expended to inform me <\s>
<s> this gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good if not the best intelligence of any man in great britain as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both houses not particularly obnoxious to the majority and for his abilities they are too well known to dr franklin to need any attempt to do them justice in a letter <\s>
<s> i am with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable congress and their committee of secret correspondence c <\s>
<s> _august 1st since writing the foregoing i have been at and am of opinion that a war between portugal and spain is at the door and i have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of portugal who resides here on commercial affairs which i have most readily embraced and expect to see him again on wednesday next after which i will write you further his proposals are merely commercial as is his station but something else may be investigated <\s>
<s> _august 2nd i should have sent this off earlier but delayed on account of hearing something more directly if i might depend on certain articles for which i was in treaty i am now assured i may and the whole will be ready to ship in all the month of october <\s>
<s> my next labor will be to obtain a convoy which i do not despair of though it is a delicate question and i have only sounded at a distance yet i have no doubt of obtaining one at least off the coast of europe and the articles will be shipped as for the west india islands <\s>
<s> i propose arming and well manning the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked and i advise again the sending all remittances to europe in armed vessels the probability of meeting with english merchants is well worth the risk <\s>
<s> i hope that it will be considered that 100 field pieces and arms clothing and accoutrements with military stores for 25,000 men is a large affair and that although i am promised any credit yet as they must be paid for the sooner the better if to be done without too great a risk <\s>
<s> a considerable part of these articles are now on hand and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this day <\s>
<s> i prefer bordeaux to any other port for shipping them from but the remittances must be made to several on which i will give you my opinion in my next <\s>
<s> a number of gentlemen of rank and fortune who have seen service and have good characters are desirous of serving the united colonies and have applied pray let me have orders on this subject if it be politic to interest this kingdom in the present contest what way so effectual as to get into their debt for supplies and employ persons of good family and connexions in it in our service <\s>
<s> i have given encouragement on which some are prepared to embark <\s>
<s> a celebrated engineer who was chief in that way in the turkish army is returned and is willing to go to america but the ministry cannot as yet spare him as certain regulations are making elsewhere possibly he may go out sometime in the winter he is a first character in his profession and otherwise <\s>
<s> indeed this contention has set on foot such a spirit of inquiry in europe into the state of america that i am convinced that at the first close of this war if as i trust in god it will close in our favor there will be an inundation of inhabitants from this side of the globe <\s>
<s> many persons of capital fortunes have declared to me their resolution of moving to america as soon as the liberties of america shall be established and that many of their friends will accompany them <\s>
<s> _august 15th i received from a friend at amsterdam a letter informing me that he would be with me on the 20th and as the vessel could not be sooner ready to sail i determined not to risk this packet by a private hand or by the public post he is now arrived and takes charge of it in person <\s>
<s> were it possible i would attempt to paint to you the heart rending anxiety i have suffered in this time through a total want of intelligence my arrival here my name my lodgings and many other particulars have been reported to the british administration on which they sent orders to the british ambassador to remonstrate in high terms and to enforce their remonstrance despatched wedderburn from london and lord rochford from holland as a person of great interest and address here to counteract me <\s>
<s> they have been some time here and the city swarms with englishmen and as money purchases every thing in this country i have had and still have a most difficult task to avoid their machinations <\s>
<s> not a coffee-house or theatre or other place of public diversion but swarms with their emissaries but knowing the ministry are my friends i attend these places as others but cautiously avoid saying a word on american affairs any where except in my own hotel or those of my intimate friends <\s>
<s> i have seen many more of the persons in power in this time and had long conversations with them their intentions are good and they appear convinced but there is wanting a great and daring genius at their head which the count maurepas is very far from being he has even imbibed a notion that no assistance is necessary as the colonies are too powerful for great britain <\s>
<s> all eyes are turned on the duc de choiseul <\s>
<s> i am convinced the moment he comes into office an active open and will be taken <\s>
<s> i think he will be minister very soon meantime i have nothing to complain of the <\s>
<s> indeed they will not be altered if he takes the lead <\s>
<s> beaumarchais as i before hinted possesses the entire confidence of the ministry he is a man of wit and genius and a considerable writer on comic and political subjects all my supplies are to come through his hands which at first greatly discouraged my friends knowing him to be a person of no interest with the merchants but had i been as doubtful as they i could not have stepped aside from the path so cordially marked out for me by those i depend on <\s>
