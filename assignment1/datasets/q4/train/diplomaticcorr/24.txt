<s> the jamaica fleet the windward island fleet and a small fleet from the mediterranean have arrived at london which has enabled them to obtain by means of a violent impress perhaps a thousand or fifteen hundred seamen who will man two or three ships more in the whole making admiral keppel's fleet somewhat nearer to an equality with the french <\s>

<s> de vergennes upon this intelligence requests that we would write expressly to acquaint the congress that though no formal declaration of war has yet been published the war between france and england is considered as actually existing from the time of the return of the ambassadors and that if england should propose a peace with france the immediate answer to the proposition would be our eventual treaty with the united states is now in full force and we will make no peace but in concurrence with them <\s>
<s> and we have given it as our firm opinion that such an answer will be given by you without the least hesitation or difficulty though you may not have been informed before as you now are that war being actually begun the eventual treaty is become fully and completely binding <\s>
