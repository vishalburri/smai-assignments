<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>

<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>

<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>
<s> ignorance of the declaration of war not to be pleaded more than two months after the declaration <\s>
<s> now by the bill of lading which we had the honor to enclose to your excellency it appears that the goods were shipped in the month of april last at a time when certainly two months had not elapsed from and after the declaration of war <\s>
<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>

<s> it may be proper to inform your excellency that before this war began one third part of the seamen belonging to the then whole british empire belonged to america <\s>
<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>

<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>

<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>

<s> sir the letter your excellency did us the honor to write to us the 7th of this month we duly received <\s>
<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>
<s> ignorance of the declaration of war not to be pleaded more than two months after the declaration <\s>
<s> now by the bill of lading which we had the honor to enclose to your excellency it appears that the goods were shipped in the month of april last at a time when certainly two months had not elapsed from and after the declaration of war <\s>
<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>
<s> these seamen we should be glad to deliver from the prisons in this kingdom and from a misery and captivity infinitely more detestable on board of british men of war <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to propose to your excellency that an inquiry be made and a list taken of the natives of america among the crews of the fox and lively and the men delivered to us <\s>
<s> this would be attended with many happy consequences <\s>
<s> it would relieve many of our countrymen from present confinement and the most dismal prospects and would furnish our vessels with a number of excellent sailors <\s>
<s> it may be proper to inform your excellency that before this war began one third part of the seamen belonging to the then whole british empire belonged to america <\s>
<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>
<s> but alas this is not the case <\s>
<s> various causes too many to be here explained have concurred to prevent this <\s>
<s> but we are very desirous of alluring back to their country as many as possible of those we have lost and the plan we have now proposed to your excellency appears to be one probable means of doing it <\s>

<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>

<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>

<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>

<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>

<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>

<s> convinced of the propriety of those eclaircissements which his excellency demands we had recourse to our various instructions from congress and although we have power and instructions to treat and conclude treaties with all the european powers to whom no particular minister has been sent by congress yet we cannot find that our powers extend to conclude treaties with the barbary states <\s>

<s> we have however the honor to agree with his excellency in opinion that an acknowledgment of the independence of the united states on the part of these powers and a treaty of commerce between them and us would be beneficial to both and a negotiation to that end not unlikely to succeed because there has been heretofore some trade between them and us in the course of which our people and vessels were well received <\s>
<s> we therefore submit to his excellency's judgment either to commence a negotiation for passes for american vessels immediately or to wait until we can write to congress and obtain power to treat with those states and conclude treaties of commerce with them when we shall request to commence and conclude the negotiation through the mediation and under the auspices of his majesty <\s>
<s> we have the honor to request his excellency's advice hereupon <\s>
<s> we address this to your excellency as we have done many other things which we suppose may be referred to other departments because your excellency being the minister for foreign affairs we have understood that we have no right to apply in the first instance to any other <\s>

<s> sir the letter your excellency did us the honor to write to us the 7th of this month we duly received <\s>
<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>
<s> ignorance of the declaration of war not to be pleaded more than two months after the declaration <\s>
<s> now by the bill of lading which we had the honor to enclose to your excellency it appears that the goods were shipped in the month of april last at a time when certainly two months had not elapsed from and after the declaration of war <\s>
<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>
<s> these seamen we should be glad to deliver from the prisons in this kingdom and from a misery and captivity infinitely more detestable on board of british men of war <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to propose to your excellency that an inquiry be made and a list taken of the natives of america among the crews of the fox and lively and the men delivered to us <\s>
<s> this would be attended with many happy consequences <\s>
<s> it would relieve many of our countrymen from present confinement and the most dismal prospects and would furnish our vessels with a number of excellent sailors <\s>
<s> it may be proper to inform your excellency that before this war began one third part of the seamen belonging to the then whole british empire belonged to america <\s>
<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>
<s> but alas this is not the case <\s>
<s> various causes too many to be here explained have concurred to prevent this <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>

<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>

<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>

<s> convinced of the propriety of those eclaircissements which his excellency demands we had recourse to our various instructions from congress and although we have power and instructions to treat and conclude treaties with all the european powers to whom no particular minister has been sent by congress yet we cannot find that our powers extend to conclude treaties with the barbary states <\s>

<s> we have however the honor to agree with his excellency in opinion that an acknowledgment of the independence of the united states on the part of these powers and a treaty of commerce between them and us would be beneficial to both and a negotiation to that end not unlikely to succeed because there has been heretofore some trade between them and us in the course of which our people and vessels were well received <\s>
<s> we therefore submit to his excellency's judgment either to commence a negotiation for passes for american vessels immediately or to wait until we can write to congress and obtain power to treat with those states and conclude treaties of commerce with them when we shall request to commence and conclude the negotiation through the mediation and under the auspices of his majesty <\s>
<s> we have the honor to request his excellency's advice hereupon <\s>
<s> we address this to your excellency as we have done many other things which we suppose may be referred to other departments because your excellency being the minister for foreign affairs we have understood that we have no right to apply in the first instance to any other <\s>

<s> sir the letter your excellency did us the honor to write to us the 7th of this month we duly received <\s>
<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>
<s> ignorance of the declaration of war not to be pleaded more than two months after the declaration <\s>
<s> now by the bill of lading which we had the honor to enclose to your excellency it appears that the goods were shipped in the month of april last at a time when certainly two months had not elapsed from and after the declaration of war <\s>
<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>
<s> these seamen we should be glad to deliver from the prisons in this kingdom and from a misery and captivity infinitely more detestable on board of british men of war <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to propose to your excellency that an inquiry be made and a list taken of the natives of america among the crews of the fox and lively and the men delivered to us <\s>
<s> this would be attended with many happy consequences <\s>
<s> it would relieve many of our countrymen from present confinement and the most dismal prospects and would furnish our vessels with a number of excellent sailors <\s>
<s> it may be proper to inform your excellency that before this war began one third part of the seamen belonging to the then whole british empire belonged to america <\s>
<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>
<s> but alas this is not the case <\s>
<s> various causes too many to be here explained have concurred to prevent this <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>

<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>

<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>

<s> convinced of the propriety of those eclaircissements which his excellency demands we had recourse to our various instructions from congress and although we have power and instructions to treat and conclude treaties with all the european powers to whom no particular minister has been sent by congress yet we cannot find that our powers extend to conclude treaties with the barbary states <\s>

<s> we have however the honor to agree with his excellency in opinion that an acknowledgment of the independence of the united states on the part of these powers and a treaty of commerce between them and us would be beneficial to both and a negotiation to that end not unlikely to succeed because there has been heretofore some trade between them and us in the course of which our people and vessels were well received <\s>
<s> we therefore submit to his excellency's judgment either to commence a negotiation for passes for american vessels immediately or to wait until we can write to congress and obtain power to treat with those states and conclude treaties of commerce with them when we shall request to commence and conclude the negotiation through the mediation and under the auspices of his majesty <\s>
<s> we have the honor to request his excellency's advice hereupon <\s>
<s> we address this to your excellency as we have done many other things which we suppose may be referred to other departments because your excellency being the minister for foreign affairs we have understood that we have no right to apply in the first instance to any other <\s>

<s> sir the letter your excellency did us the honor to write to us the 7th of this month we duly received <\s>
<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>
<s> ignorance of the declaration of war not to be pleaded more than two months after the declaration <\s>
<s> now by the bill of lading which we had the honor to enclose to your excellency it appears that the goods were shipped in the month of april last at a time when certainly two months had not elapsed from and after the declaration of war <\s>
<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>
<s> these seamen we should be glad to deliver from the prisons in this kingdom and from a misery and captivity infinitely more detestable on board of british men of war <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to propose to your excellency that an inquiry be made and a list taken of the natives of america among the crews of the fox and lively and the men delivered to us <\s>
<s> this would be attended with many happy consequences <\s>
<s> it would relieve many of our countrymen from present confinement and the most dismal prospects and would furnish our vessels with a number of excellent sailors <\s>
<s> it may be proper to inform your excellency that before this war began one third part of the seamen belonging to the then whole british empire belonged to america <\s>
<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>
<s> but alas this is not the case <\s>
<s> various causes too many to be here explained have concurred to prevent this <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>

<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>

<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>

<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>

<s> convinced of the propriety of those eclaircissements which his excellency demands we had recourse to our various instructions from congress and although we have power and instructions to treat and conclude treaties with all the european powers to whom no particular minister has been sent by congress yet we cannot find that our powers extend to conclude treaties with the barbary states <\s>
<s> we are nevertheless instructed to endeavor to obtain passes for vessels of the united states and their subjects from those powers through the mediation and influence of his most christian majesty which we therefore request his excellency to endeavor to procure provided he sees no danger in the attempt or material objections to it <\s>
<s> we have however the honor to agree with his excellency in opinion that an acknowledgment of the independence of the united states on the part of these powers and a treaty of commerce between them and us would be beneficial to both and a negotiation to that end not unlikely to succeed because there has been heretofore some trade between them and us in the course of which our people and vessels were well received <\s>
<s> we therefore submit to his excellency's judgment either to commence a negotiation for passes for american vessels immediately or to wait until we can write to congress and obtain power to treat with those states and conclude treaties of commerce with them when we shall request to commence and conclude the negotiation through the mediation and under the auspices of his majesty <\s>
<s> we have the honor to request his excellency's advice hereupon <\s>
<s> we address this to your excellency as we have done many other things which we suppose may be referred to other departments because your excellency being the minister for foreign affairs we have understood that we have no right to apply in the first instance to any other <\s>
<s> but if we have been misinformed and ill-advised in this and there is no impropriety in our making immediate application to other ministers upon subjects we know to be in their departments we request your excellency to give us an intimation of it and for the future we will avoid giving unnecessary trouble to your excellency <\s>

<s> sir the letter your excellency did us the honor to write to us the 7th of this month we duly received <\s>
<s> in our letter of the 26th of last month respecting the goods of mr izard on board the nile we cited the 16th article of the treaty of commerce in support of mr izard's claim which your excellency thinks an error and that it is the 14th article which most nearly relates to his case <\s>
<s> we cited the article as it stood in the original treaty where it is the 16th <\s>
<s> your excellency cites it as it stands in the treaty now agreed to be amended leaving out two articles the 11th and 12th <\s>
<s> but your excellency and we mean all the same article which appears to us to apply to mr izard's case as clearly strictly and fully as it could have been contrived to do if his case had been in contemplation at the time when the treaty was made and specially meant to be provided for <\s>
<s> the words of the article are that such goods as were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it shall no ways be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietor demanding the same <\s>
<s> ignorance of the declaration of war not to be pleaded more than two months after the declaration <\s>
<s> now by the bill of lading which we had the honor to enclose to your excellency it appears that the goods were shipped in the month of april last at a time when certainly two months had not elapsed from and after the declaration of war <\s>
<s> but if other evidence of this fact viz <\s>
<s> the time when these goods were shipped is necessary mr izard can certainly obtain it from england although it would be attended with a good deal of trouble and expense <\s>
<s> as to the question whether the goods are mr izard's property or not mr izard in a letter to us dated the 10th of this month assures us that his name is in many of the books and that one of the boxes contains a great number of his papers with his name upon them <\s>
<s> that the testimony of his merchant in london who shipped the things shall be procured if necessary and likewise that of the merchant in leghorn and the abbe niccoli to whom they are addressed <\s>
<s> we are only desirous of what is right and as we hold ourselves bound to do all in our power to assist our fellow citizens in maintaining their rights and of omitting no advantage that they are entitled to by the treaty and as the treaty is so express that goods so circumstanced shall be restored without delay and upon demand and as mr izard apprehends he ought not to be put to the trouble delay and expense of a lawsuit on this occasion we have thought it our duty to write again to your excellency on the subject <\s>
<s> we are sensible that his majesty has granted the whole of the property which shall be taken from the enemy and shall be lawful prize to the captors and the encouragement of adventurers in this way is of so much importance to our country as well as to this that we wish them to enjoy all the profits and advantages of their prizes <\s>
<s> but the captors in this case must be sensible that the goods belonged to a friend not an enemy and therefore not included in his majesty's grant <\s>
<s> we beg leave to lay another subject before your excellency <\s>
<s> there are we are informed on board the fox and the lively as there are in almost every ship in admiral keppel's and lord howe's fleets numbers of american seamen who abhor the service into which by one of the most extravagant flights of tyranny and cruelty that ever was heard of among men they have been forced and compelled to fight against their country and their friends <\s>
<s> these seamen we should be glad to deliver from the prisons in this kingdom and from a misery and captivity infinitely more detestable on board of british men of war <\s>
<s> we therefore beg leave to propose to your excellency that an inquiry be made and a list taken of the natives of america among the crews of the fox and lively and the men delivered to us <\s>
<s> this would be attended with many happy consequences <\s>
<s> it would relieve many of our countrymen from present confinement and the most dismal prospects and would furnish our vessels with a number of excellent sailors <\s>
<s> it may be proper to inform your excellency that before this war began one third part of the seamen belonging to the then whole british empire belonged to america <\s>
<s> if we were able to command the services of all the sailors it would be of great importance to the common cause it would take away one third of the whole those employed in the american service would be able to fight another third remaining to great britain and consequently would leave to france no more than one third of the seamen belonging to the british empire before the war for france to contend with <\s>
<s> but alas this is not the case <\s>
<s> various causes too many to be here explained have concurred to prevent this <\s>
