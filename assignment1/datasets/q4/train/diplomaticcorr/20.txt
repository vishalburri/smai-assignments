<s> the great aim of this treaty is declared to be to establish the liberty sovereignty and independency absolute and unlimited of the united states as well in matters of government as commerce and this is guarantied to us by france together with all the countries we possess or shall possess at the conclusion of the war in return for which the states guaranty to france all its possessions in america <\s>
<s> we do not now add more particulars as you will soon have the whole by a safer conveyance a frigate being appointed to carry our despatches <\s>
<s> we only observe to you and with pleasure that we have found throughout this business the greatest cordiality in this court and that no advantage has been taken or attempted to be taken of our present difficulties to obtain hard terms from us but such has been the king's magnanimity and goodness that he has proposed none which we might not readily have agreed to in a state of full prosperity and established power <\s>
<s> the principle laid down as the basis of the treaty being as declared in the preamble the most perfect equality and reciprocity the privileges in trade c <\s>

<s> on the whole we have abundant reason to be satisfied with the good will of this court and of the nation in general which we therefore hope will be cultivated by the congress by every means which may establish the union and render it permanent <\s>
<s> spain being slow there is a separate and secret clause by which she is to be received into the alliance upon requisition and there is no doubt of the event <\s>
<s> when we mention the good will of this nation to our cause we may add that of all europe which having been offended by the pride and insolence of britain wishes to see its power diminished and all who have received injuries from her are by one of the articles to be invited into our alliance <\s>

<s> gentlemen we have now the pleasure of sending you the treaties of amity and alliance which france completed after long deliberation and signed the 6th instant <\s>
<s> this is an event which will give our states such an appearance of stability as must strengthen our credit encourage other powers in europe to ally themselves with us weaken the hopes of our internal as well as our external enemies fortify our friends and be in many other respects so advantageous to us that we congratulate you upon it most heartily <\s>

<s> as the english are pretty strong in the bay it is probable that their attack and the french defence of our ships may be the prelude of a declaration on both sides <\s>

<s> but as we apprehend it may be known here by some means or other should we furnish the expense of these embassies out of the aids received from this court which we think not reputable to the congress we must again press you to make us the necessary remittances to replace what we have borrowed from the fund destined for your supplies <\s>

<s> the great aim of this treaty is declared to be to establish the liberty sovereignty and independency absolute and unlimited of the united states as well in matters of government as commerce and this is guarantied to us by france together with all the countries we possess or shall possess at the conclusion of the war in return for which the states guaranty to france all its possessions in america <\s>
<s> we do not now add more particulars as you will soon have the whole by a safer conveyance a frigate being appointed to carry our despatches <\s>
<s> we only observe to you and with pleasure that we have found throughout this business the greatest cordiality in this court and that no advantage has been taken or attempted to be taken of our present difficulties to obtain hard terms from us but such has been the king's magnanimity and goodness that he has proposed none which we might not readily have agreed to in a state of full prosperity and established power <\s>
<s> the principle laid down as the basis of the treaty being as declared in the preamble the most perfect equality and reciprocity the privileges in trade c <\s>

<s> on the whole we have abundant reason to be satisfied with the good will of this court and of the nation in general which we therefore hope will be cultivated by the congress by every means which may establish the union and render it permanent <\s>
<s> spain being slow there is a separate and secret clause by which she is to be received into the alliance upon requisition and there is no doubt of the event <\s>
<s> when we mention the good will of this nation to our cause we may add that of all europe which having been offended by the pride and insolence of britain wishes to see its power diminished and all who have received injuries from her are by one of the articles to be invited into our alliance <\s>

<s> gentlemen we have now the pleasure of sending you the treaties of amity and alliance which france completed after long deliberation and signed the 6th instant <\s>
<s> this is an event which will give our states such an appearance of stability as must strengthen our credit encourage other powers in europe to ally themselves with us weaken the hopes of our internal as well as our external enemies fortify our friends and be in many other respects so advantageous to us that we congratulate you upon it most heartily <\s>

<s> as the english are pretty strong in the bay it is probable that their attack and the french defence of our ships may be the prelude of a declaration on both sides <\s>

<s> but as we apprehend it may be known here by some means or other should we furnish the expense of these embassies out of the aids received from this court which we think not reputable to the congress we must again press you to make us the necessary remittances to replace what we have borrowed from the fund destined for your supplies <\s>

<s> the great aim of this treaty is declared to be to establish the liberty sovereignty and independency absolute and unlimited of the united states as well in matters of government as commerce and this is guarantied to us by france together with all the countries we possess or shall possess at the conclusion of the war in return for which the states guaranty to france all its possessions in america <\s>
<s> we do not now add more particulars as you will soon have the whole by a safer conveyance a frigate being appointed to carry our despatches <\s>
<s> we only observe to you and with pleasure that we have found throughout this business the greatest cordiality in this court and that no advantage has been taken or attempted to be taken of our present difficulties to obtain hard terms from us but such has been the king's magnanimity and goodness that he has proposed none which we might not readily have agreed to in a state of full prosperity and established power <\s>
<s> the principle laid down as the basis of the treaty being as declared in the preamble the most perfect equality and reciprocity the privileges in trade c <\s>

<s> on the whole we have abundant reason to be satisfied with the good will of this court and of the nation in general which we therefore hope will be cultivated by the congress by every means which may establish the union and render it permanent <\s>
<s> spain being slow there is a separate and secret clause by which she is to be received into the alliance upon requisition and there is no doubt of the event <\s>
<s> when we mention the good will of this nation to our cause we may add that of all europe which having been offended by the pride and insolence of britain wishes to see its power diminished and all who have received injuries from her are by one of the articles to be invited into our alliance <\s>

<s> gentlemen we have now the pleasure of sending you the treaties of amity and alliance which france completed after long deliberation and signed the 6th instant <\s>
<s> this is an event which will give our states such an appearance of stability as must strengthen our credit encourage other powers in europe to ally themselves with us weaken the hopes of our internal as well as our external enemies fortify our friends and be in many other respects so advantageous to us that we congratulate you upon it most heartily <\s>

<s> as the english are pretty strong in the bay it is probable that their attack and the french defence of our ships may be the prelude of a declaration on both sides <\s>

<s> but as we apprehend it may be known here by some means or other should we furnish the expense of these embassies out of the aids received from this court which we think not reputable to the congress we must again press you to make us the necessary remittances to replace what we have borrowed from the fund destined for your supplies <\s>

<s> the great aim of this treaty is declared to be to establish the liberty sovereignty and independency absolute and unlimited of the united states as well in matters of government as commerce and this is guarantied to us by france together with all the countries we possess or shall possess at the conclusion of the war in return for which the states guaranty to france all its possessions in america <\s>
<s> we do not now add more particulars as you will soon have the whole by a safer conveyance a frigate being appointed to carry our despatches <\s>
<s> we only observe to you and with pleasure that we have found throughout this business the greatest cordiality in this court and that no advantage has been taken or attempted to be taken of our present difficulties to obtain hard terms from us but such has been the king's magnanimity and goodness that he has proposed none which we might not readily have agreed to in a state of full prosperity and established power <\s>
<s> the principle laid down as the basis of the treaty being as declared in the preamble the most perfect equality and reciprocity the privileges in trade c <\s>

<s> on the whole we have abundant reason to be satisfied with the good will of this court and of the nation in general which we therefore hope will be cultivated by the congress by every means which may establish the union and render it permanent <\s>
<s> spain being slow there is a separate and secret clause by which she is to be received into the alliance upon requisition and there is no doubt of the event <\s>
<s> when we mention the good will of this nation to our cause we may add that of all europe which having been offended by the pride and insolence of britain wishes to see its power diminished and all who have received injuries from her are by one of the articles to be invited into our alliance <\s>

<s> gentlemen we have now the pleasure of sending you the treaties of amity and alliance which france completed after long deliberation and signed the 6th instant <\s>
<s> this is an event which will give our states such an appearance of stability as must strengthen our credit encourage other powers in europe to ally themselves with us weaken the hopes of our internal as well as our external enemies fortify our friends and be in many other respects so advantageous to us that we congratulate you upon it most heartily <\s>

<s> as the english are pretty strong in the bay it is probable that their attack and the french defence of our ships may be the prelude of a declaration on both sides <\s>

<s> but as we apprehend it may be known here by some means or other should we furnish the expense of these embassies out of the aids received from this court which we think not reputable to the congress we must again press you to make us the necessary remittances to replace what we have borrowed from the fund destined for your supplies <\s>

<s> and we are assured by the last post from good authority that even lord mansfield who in the beginning of this business was so valiant spoke lately in private to lord camden of the absolute necessity of an immediate coalition of parties to prevent the great impending danger to the nation from an alliance between the house of bourbon and the americans which he said he had good information was on the point of being concluded <\s>

<s> passy 28th february 1778 <\s>
<s> gentlemen our despatches of december 18th which would have acquainted you with the state of our affairs here and our expectations of a speedy conclusion of the treaties with this court are unfortunately returned the french man of war which went on purpose to carry them having met with some disasters at sea which obliged her to put back after a long struggle of six weeks against contrary winds <\s>
<s> we now have obtained another ship to sail with them immediately and with our fresh despatches containing the treaties themselves which were happily concluded and signed the 6th instant though hitherto for some political reasons kept a secret from the public <\s>
<s> the english parliament adjourned in december for six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time their ministers strained every nerve to raise men for their armies intending to continue the war with vigor <\s>
<s> subscriptions were set on foot to aid government in the expense and they flattered themselves with being able to enlist ten thousand volunteers but whether they found this impracticable or were discouraged by later accounts from america or had some intimations of our treaties here their vaunts and threats are suddenly abated and on the 17th lord north made a long discourse acknowledging the errors of their former conduct in the war with america and proposing to obtain peace by the means of two bills of which we enclose copies <\s>
<s> we make no remarks on these bills <\s>
<s> the judgment of the congress can be at no loss in determining on the conduct necessary to be held with regard to them <\s>
<s> and we are confident that they will not answer the purpose of _dividing_ in order to _subjugate_ for which they are evidently intended <\s>
<s> our states have now a solid support for their liberty and independence in their alliance with france which will be certainly followed by that of spain and the whole house of bourbon and probably by that of holland and the other powers of europe who are interested in the freedom of commerce and in keeping down the power of britain <\s>
<s> our people are happy in the enjoyment of their new constitutions of government and will be so in their extended trade and navigation unfettered by english arts and custom-house officers <\s>
<s> they will now never relish the egyptian bondage from which they have so happily escaped <\s>
<s> a long peace will probably be the consequence of their separation from england as they have no cause of quarrel with other nations an immediate war with france and spain if they join again with england and a share in all her future wars her debts and her crimes <\s>
<s> we are therefore persuaded that their commissioners will be soon dismissed if at all received for the sooner the decided part taken by congress is known in europe the more extended and stable will be their credit and their conventions with other powers more easy to make and more advantageous <\s>
<s> americans are every where in france treated with respect and every appearance of affection <\s>
<s> we think it would be well to advise our people in all parts of america to imitate this conduct with regard to the french who may happen to be among us <\s>
<s> every means should be used to remove ancient prejudices and cultivate a friendship that must be so useful to both nations <\s>
<s> some transactions here during the last four or five months in the rigorous observance of treaties with regard to the equipments of our armed vessels in the ports and the selling of our prizes have no doubt made ill impressions on the minds of our seamen and traders relative to the friendship of this court <\s>
<s> we were then obliged to observe a secrecy which prevented our removing those prejudices by acquainting our people with the substantial aids france was privately affording us and we must continue in the same situation till it is thought fit to publish the treaties <\s>
<s> but we can with pleasure now acquaint you that we have obtained full satisfaction viz <\s>
<s> 400,000 livres for the owners of the prizes confiscated here for a breach of the laws by a false declaration they being entered as coming from eustatia and the payment will be made to the owners in america <\s>
<s> we mean the prizes taken by captains babson and hendricks in the boston and hancock privateers which prizes after confiscation were from reasons of state restored to the english <\s>
<s> this is a fresh proof of the good will and generosity of this court and their determination to cultivate the friendship of america <\s>
<s> the preparations for war continue in the ports with the utmost industry and troops are marching daily to the sea-coasts where three camps are to be formed <\s>
<s> as france is determined to protect her commerce with us a war is deemed inevitable <\s>
<s> mr william lee we suppose acquaints you with the decease of mr morris his colleague in the commercial agency <\s>
<s> on our application to the ministry an order was obtained to put mr lee in possession of his papers <\s>
<s> if that department has been found useful and likely to continue so you will no doubt appoint one or more persons to take care of the business as mr lee has now another destination <\s>
<s> perhaps the general commerce likely to be soon opened between europe and america may render such an appointment unnecessary <\s>
<s> we would just add for the consideration of congress whether considering the mention of bermudas in one of the articles it may not be well to take possession with the consent of the inhabitants of that island and fortify the same as soon as possible and also to reduce some or all of the english fishing posts in or near newfoundland <\s>
