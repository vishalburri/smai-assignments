<s> perhaps as our independency begins to wear the appearance of greater stability since our acknowledged alliance with france that difficulty may be lessened <\s>
<s> of this we wish you to take the most prudent methods privately to inform yourself <\s>
<s> it seems clearly to be the interest of holland to share in the rapidly growing commerce of their young sister republic and as in the love of liberty and bravery in defence of it she has been our great example we hope circumstances and constitutions in many respects so similar may produce mutual benevolence and that the unfavorable impressions made on the minds of some in america by the rigor with which supplies of arms and ammunition were refused them in their distress may soon be worn off and obliterated by a friendly intercourse and reciprocal good offices <\s>
<s> when mr adams left america which was about the middle of february our affairs were daily improving our troops well supplied with arms and provisions and in good order and the army of general burgoyne being detained for breaches of the capitulation we had in our hands above 10,000 prisoners of the enemy <\s>

<s> perhaps as our independency begins to wear the appearance of greater stability since our acknowledged alliance with france that difficulty may be lessened <\s>
<s> of this we wish you to take the most prudent methods privately to inform yourself <\s>
<s> it seems clearly to be the interest of holland to share in the rapidly growing commerce of their young sister republic and as in the love of liberty and bravery in defence of it she has been our great example we hope circumstances and constitutions in many respects so similar may produce mutual benevolence and that the unfavorable impressions made on the minds of some in america by the rigor with which supplies of arms and ammunition were refused them in their distress may soon be worn off and obliterated by a friendly intercourse and reciprocal good offices <\s>
<s> when mr adams left america which was about the middle of february our affairs were daily improving our troops well supplied with arms and provisions and in good order and the army of general burgoyne being detained for breaches of the capitulation we had in our hands above 10,000 prisoners of the enemy <\s>
