<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>
<s> mr hodge went to dunkirk by order of the commissioners <\s>
<s> they sent him in consequence of orders from the secret committee he purchased and fitted out two vessels a fact though forgotten by mr lee known to every one at the time <\s>
<s> from what that brave and virtuous young american did and suffered on the occasion it was the common topic of conversation every where it raised insurance in england ten per cent for a time <\s>
<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>
<s> mr hodge was released from his imprisonment and one of the first things he did was to give mr lee the account of his whole disbursements in writing <\s>
<s> mr hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first and proposed following cunningham into spain by land and making a cruise with him <\s>
<s> he proposed that mr ross and he should purchase the vessel but as a price could not easily be agreed upon they proposed to take the vessel as she was and do the best with her against the common enemy and to account to congress therefor <\s>
<s> mr ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the commissioners for his security <\s>
<s> gerard on the subject and appeared perfectly satisfied <\s>

<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>

<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>

<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>

<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>

<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>

<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>

<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>

<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>

<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>

<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>
<s> mr hodge went to dunkirk by order of the commissioners <\s>
<s> they sent him in consequence of orders from the secret committee he purchased and fitted out two vessels a fact though forgotten by mr lee known to every one at the time <\s>
<s> from what that brave and virtuous young american did and suffered on the occasion it was the common topic of conversation every where it raised insurance in england ten per cent for a time <\s>
<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>
<s> mr hodge was released from his imprisonment and one of the first things he did was to give mr lee the account of his whole disbursements in writing <\s>
<s> mr hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first and proposed following cunningham into spain by land and making a cruise with him <\s>
<s> he proposed that mr ross and he should purchase the vessel but as a price could not easily be agreed upon they proposed to take the vessel as she was and do the best with her against the common enemy and to account to congress therefor <\s>
<s> mr ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the commissioners for his security <\s>
<s> gerard on the subject and appeared perfectly satisfied <\s>
<s> if any doubts arise on this subject i shall be happy to refer for satisfaction on that head to mons <\s>
<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>

<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>

<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>

<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>

<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>

<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>

<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>
<s> mr hodge went to dunkirk by order of the commissioners <\s>
<s> they sent him in consequence of orders from the secret committee he purchased and fitted out two vessels a fact though forgotten by mr lee known to every one at the time <\s>
<s> from what that brave and virtuous young american did and suffered on the occasion it was the common topic of conversation every where it raised insurance in england ten per cent for a time <\s>
<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>
<s> mr hodge was released from his imprisonment and one of the first things he did was to give mr lee the account of his whole disbursements in writing <\s>
<s> mr hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first and proposed following cunningham into spain by land and making a cruise with him <\s>
<s> he proposed that mr ross and he should purchase the vessel but as a price could not easily be agreed upon they proposed to take the vessel as she was and do the best with her against the common enemy and to account to congress therefor <\s>
<s> mr ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the commissioners for his security <\s>
<s> gerard on the subject and appeared perfectly satisfied <\s>
<s> if any doubts arise on this subject i shall be happy to refer for satisfaction on that head to mons <\s>
<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>

<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>

<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>

<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>

<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>

<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>

<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>

<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>

<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>

<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>

<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>

<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>

<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>

<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>

<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>

<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>

<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>

<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>

<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>

<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>

<s> i really know not what he means <\s>

<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>

<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>

<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>

<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>
<s> mr hodge went to dunkirk by order of the commissioners <\s>
<s> they sent him in consequence of orders from the secret committee he purchased and fitted out two vessels a fact though forgotten by mr lee known to every one at the time <\s>
<s> from what that brave and virtuous young american did and suffered on the occasion it was the common topic of conversation every where it raised insurance in england ten per cent for a time <\s>
<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>
<s> mr hodge was released from his imprisonment and one of the first things he did was to give mr lee the account of his whole disbursements in writing <\s>
<s> mr hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first and proposed following cunningham into spain by land and making a cruise with him <\s>
<s> he proposed that mr ross and he should purchase the vessel but as a price could not easily be agreed upon they proposed to take the vessel as she was and do the best with her against the common enemy and to account to congress therefor <\s>
<s> mr ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the commissioners for his security <\s>
<s> gerard on the subject and appeared perfectly satisfied <\s>
<s> if any doubts arise on this subject i shall be happy to refer for satisfaction on that head to mons <\s>

<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>

<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>

<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>

<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>

<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>

<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>

<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>

<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>

<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>

<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>
<s> mr hodge went to dunkirk by order of the commissioners <\s>
<s> they sent him in consequence of orders from the secret committee he purchased and fitted out two vessels a fact though forgotten by mr lee known to every one at the time <\s>
<s> from what that brave and virtuous young american did and suffered on the occasion it was the common topic of conversation every where it raised insurance in england ten per cent for a time <\s>
<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>
<s> mr hodge was released from his imprisonment and one of the first things he did was to give mr lee the account of his whole disbursements in writing <\s>
<s> mr hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first and proposed following cunningham into spain by land and making a cruise with him <\s>
<s> he proposed that mr ross and he should purchase the vessel but as a price could not easily be agreed upon they proposed to take the vessel as she was and do the best with her against the common enemy and to account to congress therefor <\s>
<s> mr ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the commissioners for his security <\s>
<s> gerard on the subject and appeared perfectly satisfied <\s>
<s> if any doubts arise on this subject i shall be happy to refer for satisfaction on that head to mons <\s>
<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>

<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>

<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>

<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>

<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>

<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>

<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>
<s> mr hodge went to dunkirk by order of the commissioners <\s>
<s> they sent him in consequence of orders from the secret committee he purchased and fitted out two vessels a fact though forgotten by mr lee known to every one at the time <\s>
<s> from what that brave and virtuous young american did and suffered on the occasion it was the common topic of conversation every where it raised insurance in england ten per cent for a time <\s>
<s> mr hodge to appease the british ambassador was sent to the bastile and cunningham making his cruise round england and ireland put into spain without prize money equal to the repairs he wanted <\s>
<s> mr hodge was released from his imprisonment and one of the first things he did was to give mr lee the account of his whole disbursements in writing <\s>
<s> mr hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first and proposed following cunningham into spain by land and making a cruise with him <\s>
<s> he proposed that mr ross and he should purchase the vessel but as a price could not easily be agreed upon they proposed to take the vessel as she was and do the best with her against the common enemy and to account to congress therefor <\s>
<s> mr ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the commissioners for his security <\s>
<s> gerard on the subject and appeared perfectly satisfied <\s>
<s> if any doubts arise on this subject i shall be happy to refer for satisfaction on that head to mons <\s>
<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>

<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>

<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>
<s> by this stating of the account it will appear that the commissioners for their private expenses from december 1776 to 27th march 1778 for the support and relief of americans escaping from prison in england for the payment of mons <\s>
<s> dumas agent in holland the sending of expresses the purchase of a large quantity of shoes which were sent to nantes to be shipped for america and for several less disbursements had of mr grand only the sum of 244,285 livres equal to the sum of ten thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds ten shillings sterling which is of itself a demonstration that there was no misapplication of the public monies since mr lee has written that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself <\s>
<s> whether or not extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased will be an after consideration <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee says that almost every thing still remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i really know not what he means <\s>
<s> things once paid for are not to be paid for a second time and the payments stated above are proved by mr grand's accounts to have been bona fide made <\s>
<s> bargains he says of the most extravagant kind have been made with this mons <\s>
<s> monthieu and others and then he proceeds to give an example <\s>
<s> as to the bargains i was concerned in with this man and with every other person i totally deny the fact and the example given is but a mere pretence <\s>
<s> i am so confident of the contrary that i will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me or with my consent in europe the contract with the farmers-general excepted which was partly political at the time on myself and will be bound to abide the profit or loss leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in europe <\s>
<s> mr lee informs us of one hundred thousand livres given to mr hodge and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about Â £ 3000 or 72000 livres and adds for what purpose the surplus was given to mr hodge how the public came to pay for her refitting and at length the vessel and her prize money made over to mr ross and mr hodge without a farthing being brought to public account rests with mr deane or mr hodge to explain and in a few lines further he says you will see my name is not to the contracts but he forgets to add that he was at berlin when they were made <\s>
<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>

<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>

<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>

<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
<s> monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated <\s>
<s> before the last ship sailed therefore m <\s>
<s> monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon on which dr franklin and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to mons <\s>
<s> chaumont the submission was made and signed <\s>
<s> monthieu on his return from marseilles to which place he went immediately to embark and send off the remainder of the stores urged m <\s>
<s> chaumont to undertake it <\s>
<s> i did the same he declined telling me that he found mr lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had any concerns with that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners while he was one of them but as m <\s>
<s> monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners he thought it best to settle the whole at once and when the whole was ready for a settlement if mr lee would then desire him to undertake it he would do it as well to oblige us as m <\s>
<s> monthieu for whom he had a regard <\s>
<s> this put off the settlement for the time <\s>
<s> mr lee proceeds to say it is this sort of neglect and studied confusion that has prevented mr adams and myself after a tedious examination of the papers left with dr franklin from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money <\s>
<s> all we can find is that millions have been expended and almost every thing remains to be paid for <\s>
<s> i am not surprised at any thing of this kind from mr lee nor that mr john adams has not joined with him in this letter though i dare say that gentleman knows his duty and has done it as well to the public as to me <\s>
<s> after premising that mr lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account i will lay before congress the facts which he had before him when he wrote this letter after which congress will be able to judge whether mr lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions <\s>
<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>

<s> it is certain that mr lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the time of my leaving paris amounted to livres 3,753 250 and that the balance due mr grand the 27th march was 293,738 17 and that the whole expenditures to that day consequently was livres 4,046 988 17 in the next place it will appear that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and with mr lee's consent and orders at the time the whole was well known to him as he had from time to time access to mr grand's books and mr grand delivered him copies thereof up to the 27th of march last by which he had before him an account of every payment that had been made and i sent him in writing an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence or which had not been made by his written order <\s>
<s> the accounts of the particular articles in detail not being here i am unable to explain every charge in mr grand's account <\s>
<s> it is sufficient that mr grand's account shows that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was perfectly well known to mr lee when he wrote the above account of millions expended and represented he knew not how to show this <\s>
<s> i have stated mr grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before and have brought the different payments for particular objects made to different people into one view as will be seen in the annexed state or explanation of mr grand's account <\s>
<s> i have no design in answering this part of mr lee's letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively that nothing can be more groundless and unjust than for him to represent that millions had been profusely expended and as if he knew not in what manner or to what purpose <\s>
<s> the amount of expenditures until the time of my leaving paris was 4,046 988 17 livres and it appears as well from the nature of the account as from the knowledge mr lee had of the transactions that he knew generally of the payment of every livre and to whom it had been made having the accounts and the explanation of them in his hands up to the very day i set out from paris <\s>
<s> the particular application indeed of every part could not be known until the several accounts should be given in <\s>
<s> mr lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of the monies to mr williams and the other principal payments and was well informed of the business which he mr williams was executing <\s>

<s> what i have already observed upon in mr lee's letter and what i purpose to notice confirms me in the opinion which dr franklin and some others have for some time had of him that from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind he is at last arrived on the very borders of insanity and that at times he even passes the line and it gives me pleasure though it is but a melancholy one that i can attribute to the misfortunes of his head what i must otherwise place to a depravity of heart <\s>

<s> gerard and also for what passed between mr lee and himself on the occasion as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article should be expunged if objected to by congress <\s>
<s> i have signed that narration and shall sign these observations in which i have avoided taking those advantages of mr izard which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters has given me were i disposed to make use of them because i conceive it to be an abuse if not an insult to trouble congress with any thing merely personal though i have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the world and am by no means deficient in materials <\s>
<s> i recollect perfectly well the interview at passy with mr william lee at which mr izard was present but i do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either desired or refused <\s>
<s> i rather think that mr izard misunderstood dr franklin at the time or that his memory has deceived him <\s>
<s> the facts are these <\s>
<s> the late mr thomas morris had a commission to act as commercial agent his commission was entirely distinct from and independent of the commissioners he at least construed it so himself from the beginning <\s>
<s> we were very early informed of his irregularities and admonished him and advertised congress of them <\s>
<s> as we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into france and the expense of repairing and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners dr franklin and myself mr a <\s>
<s> lee being then at berlin deputed mr williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands and ordered the captains to account with him <\s>
<s> on mr william lee's arrival at nantes he joined with mr morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on what they had done in which they complained that the office or department of commercial agent was broken in upon and that we had no power over it <\s>
<s> dr franklin at the desire of mr a <\s>
<s> lee and myself prepared an answer in which the reason of our orders was given and mr morris conduct urged as our principal motive but that as he mr william lee was there we would recall our commission from mr williams <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee would not agree to the form of the letter and after much dispute upon it a second was written when mr arthur lee observed that his brother was coming to paris soon to receive his commission for vienna and berlin and as there were then no prizes in port or expected the matter might rest <\s>
<s> this was the reason why mr w <\s>
<s> lee's letters were not answered <\s>
<s> he came to paris soon after and represented the confused state in which affairs were at nantes and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands <\s>
<s> the situation of mr william lee at that time was precisely this he had never received any commission either from congress or their committee for the commercial agency whilst mr thomas morris was and had been in the possession of a commission and in the exercise of the agency <\s>
<s> congress had made mr william lee their commissioner to the courts of vienna and berlin each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce without saying anything about his former appointment from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had been considered as superceded by the new <\s>
<s> we had received intelligence that the information we had given of mr morris's conduct had been received and read in congress and that congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation <\s>
<s> we thought it very extraordinary that we should be applied to to interfere where congress knowing the facts had declined to interfere and still more so that we should be requested to put what indeed was not in our power the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman who must execute it by deputies himself at a distance too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised <\s>
<s> the letter referred to by mr izard was a letter to this purpose and i remember well for i avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation doctor franklin's reply which was to this purpose that congress by disregarding the information we had given and continuing mr morris had impliedly censured our conduct <\s>
<s> that mr morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done and that mr william lee ought to remember that he had himself jointly with mr morris complained of our interfering as he thought in that department and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures or as he expressed it raps over the knuckles for meddling in the affair <\s>
<s> we were indeed as much surprised as mr izard appears to have been on the occasion but our surprise arose from another cause it was to find mr william lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own nature incompatible with each other and impossible to have been executed by the same person <\s>
<s> but as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us <\s>
<s> mr izard says that mr william lee complained that parties had been excited against him at nantes and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the execution of his duty these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it that he had frequently written c <\s>
<s> his letters have been taken notice of already and the reason mentioned why they were not answered <\s>
<s> the rest of this complaint is as far as i know anything about the matter totally groundless it must appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars <\s>
<s> mr william lee never had a commission to the commercial agency though he is now executing it by his agents <\s>
<s> mr lee's caution was such that he never even answered my letters to him in february or march informing him that mr robert morris had written to me that he was appointed nor did i learn anything from him of his intentions until he arrived at paris the summer following where also he acted with the greatest caution while he waited the return of his brother from berlin <\s>
<s> before and after his being at nantes he went so far as even to desire mr williams and others at paris and at nantes not to let it be known that he had anything to do in american affairs as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in london and so far was he from ever executing or publicly attempting to execute that agency until after the news of general burgoyne's defeat had arrived in france that he did nothing that ever i heard of which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his aldermanship in london <\s>
<s> mr izard is pleased to say that to let mons <\s>
<s> gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it was a very high insult to congress <\s>
<s> it was not in our power to permit or prevent mons <\s>
<s> gerard's going away and if we did not circumstanced as we then were think ourselves authorised to communicate it to mr izard i cannot conceive this to be a high insult to congress certain it is we meant no such thing we meant to serve not insult that honorable body <\s>
<s> the object he says of these gentlemen is to have mr deane come back in a public character if not to france perhaps to holland or some other part of europe and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why this should not be the case <\s>
<s> and he adds i am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by congress <\s>
<s> i have already appealed from this gentleman's opinions so i shall say nothing further about them his reasons if he offers any are to be judged of by congress <\s>
<s> i find however he had more apprehensions than reasons in this part of his letter his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some appointment for me i do not learn that he has done it i never desired or expected that he would <\s>
<s> mr izard i presume knew that i had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and character in europe but particularly in holland where i had long before been preparing the minds of such men in favor of a loan <\s>
<s> he knew that there was not merely a correspondence but a strict personal friendship subsisting between certain gentlemen in amsterdam and at the hague and myself and that i had proposed to go there on the subject of the loan as well as for other purposes <\s>
<s> i presume also he knew that the french ambassador in holland the duke de vauguyson who spent last winter in paris honored me with his acquaintance and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the united states of north america which make part of that nobleman's character urged me to go there assuring me of every personal service and civility which should be in his power <\s>
<s> my recall prevented the execution of the plan and mr izard doubtless apprehended that i should solicit for the appointment <\s>
<s> his apprehension was groundless the honorable congress know that i have not solicited for any appointment my life and fortune with what abilities i am blessed with have been from the first and will ever be devoted to the service of my country who are most certainly the best judges in what department they can be most useful or if they can be of any use at all and to their judgment i most cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful attachment c <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i beg leave to lay before congress a few observations on the extracts from mr arthur lee's letter dated paris june 1st 1778 read in congress the 3d instant which were ordered to be communicated to me <\s>
<s> mr lee begins by saying that m <\s>
<s> monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us and the grounds of them you will see that they are accounts which mr deane ought to have settled <\s>
<s> not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent i can only reply generally by informing congress that i contracted with m <\s>
<s> monthieu nearly at the time that i contracted with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais for the stores to procure ships to transport them over to america ;[ 14 the rate i was told in paris and elsewhere was as low as could be then procured in france it has risen since that time <\s>
<s> the ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable time to and from america <\s>
<s> beaumarchais was my surety <\s>
<s> the difficulty met with in getting away the stores was such that the last of the ships did not sail from marseilles until in september 1777 <\s>
<s> the delay of near twelve months of some of them in france and an uncommon delay of all of them occasioned by repeated counter orders and fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in america as for instance of the amphitrite from april until the october following with the capture of them were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making the contract and entitled m <\s>
