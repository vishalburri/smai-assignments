<s> gentlemen we send you herewith the draft of a frigate by a very ingenious officer in this service which appears to us peculiarly suitable for our purpose and we are in hopes of being able to ship cordage sailcloth and anchors c <\s>
<s> sufficient for five or six such frigates by the time you can have them built <\s>
<s> deprived of any intelligence from you since the first of last november and without remittances we are left in a situation easier to be conceived than described <\s>
<s> the want of intelligence affects the cause of the united states in every department such accounts of our affairs as arrive in europe at all come through the hands of our enemies and whether defeated or victorious we are the last who are acquainted with events which ought first to be announced by us <\s>
<s> we are really unable to account for this silence and while we are affected with the unhappy consequences of it we must entreat the honorable congress to devise some method for giving us the earliest and most certain intelligence of what passes in america <\s>
<s> the ship by which this is sent is loaded with clothing cordage and duck not having a full cargo of the former we ordered mr williams who acts for us at nantes to complete it with the latter for which we have obtained a short credit <\s>
<s> mr williams will write you by this opportunity <\s>
<s> he has been of great service to us at nantes and it is but justice to say that his knowledge of business probity activity and zeal for the interests of his country with the good opinion justly entertained of him by gentlemen in business at nantes render him very serviceable in our affairs there and proper to be employed in commercial transactions <\s>
<s> we apprehend that letters to mons <\s>
<s> schweighauser have not had fair play and therefore advise you to write to him charging the captain who carries your letters to deliver them with his own hand if he arrives at nantes and if at any other port that he send them under cover to us <\s>

<s> mr lee wrote us last week from bordeaux on his way to spain <\s>
<s> we present our most respectful compliments to the honorable congress and are gentlemen your most obedient and very humble servants b <\s>

<s> paris 12th march 1777 <\s>
<s> gentlemen it is now more than four months since mr franklin's departure from philadelphia and not a line from thence written since that time has hitherto reached either of your commissioners in europe <\s>
<s> we have had no information of what passes in america but through england and the advices are for the most part such only as the ministry choose to publish <\s>
<s> our total ignorance of the truth or falsehood of facts when questions are asked of us concerning them makes us appear small in the eyes of the people here and is prejudicial to our negotiations <\s>
<s> in ours of the 6th of february of which a copy is enclosed we acquainted you that we were about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packet boats <\s>
<s> we have succeeded in getting one from dover in which we purpose to send our present despatches <\s>
<s> mr hodge who went to dunkirk and flushing where he thought another might be easily found has not yet acquainted us with his success <\s>
<s> we promised that when we had a conveyance which by its swiftness is more likely to carry safely our letters we would be more explicit in accounts of our proceedings here which promise we shall now fulfil as follows <\s>
<s> in our first conversation with the minister after the arrival of mr franklin it was evident that this court while it treated us privately with all civility was cautious of giving umbrage to england and was therefore desirous of avoiding an open reception and acknowledgment of us or entering into any formal negotiation with us as ministers from the congress <\s>
<s> to make us easy however we were told that the ports of france were open to our ships as friends that our people might freely purchase and export as merchandise whatever our states had occasion for vending at the same time our own commodities that in doing this we should experience all the facilities that a government disposed to favor us could consistent with treaties afford to the enemies of a friend <\s>
<s> but though it was at that time no secret that two hundred field pieces of brass and thirty thousand fusils with other munitions of war in great abundance had been taken out of the king's magazines for the purpose of exportation to america the minister in our presence affected to know nothing of that operation and claimed no merit to his court on that account <\s>
<s> but he intimated to us that it would be well taken if we communicated with no other person about the court concerning our affairs but himself who would be ready at all convenient times to confer with us <\s>
<s> we soon after presented several memorials representing the state of the colonies the necessity of some naval aid and the utility to france that must result from our success in establishing the independence of america with the freedom of its commerce <\s>
<s> in answer we received a positive refusal of the ships of the line which we had been instructed to ask on this principle that if a war with england should take place the whole fleet of france would be necessary at home for her defence that if such a war did not take place yet while england apprehended a war it was equally serviceable to our states that the fleet of france should remain entire in her ports since that must retain an equal force of english at home who might otherwise go to america and who certainly would follow thither any french squadron <\s>
<s> during these conferences every step was taken to gratify england publicly by attending to the remonstrances of her ambassador forbidding the departure of ships which had military stores on board 29 recalling officers who had leave of absence and were going to join us and giving strict orders that our prizes should not be sold in french ports yet that we might not be discouraged it was intimated to us by persons about the court that these measures were necessary at present france not being yet quite ready for a war and that we might be assured of her good will to us and our cause <\s>
<s> means were proposed of our obtaining a large sum of money for present use by an advance from the farmers-general to be repaid in tobacco of which they wanted twenty thousand hogsheads <\s>
<s> we entered accordingly into a treaty with that company but meeting with difficulty in settling the terms we were informed that a grant was made us of two millions of livres from the crown of which five hundred thousand was ready to be paid us down and an equal sum should be paid at the beginning of april july and october that such was the king's generosity he exacted no conditions or promise of repayment he only required that we should not speak to any one of our having received this aid <\s>
<s> we have accordingly observed strictly this injunction deviating only in this information to you which we think necessary for your satisfaction but earnestly requesting that you would not suffer it to be made public <\s>
<s> this is the money which in our letter we mentioned as raised for us by subscription <\s>
<s> one of the ablest sea officers of france skilled in all the arts relating to the marine having offered his services to the states with the permission of the minister we enabled by the above grant engaged him to superintend the building of two ships of war of a particular construction which though not of half the cost shall be superior in force and utility to ships of sixtyfour guns <\s>
<s> he has built one here for the king which we are told exceeds every thing in swift sailing <\s>
<s> he has furnished us with drafts 30 which we send you that if the congress thinks fit others of the same construction may be set up in america in which case we have given him expectations of being their commodore <\s>
<s> we have seen his large and curious collection of memoirs containing every the minutest particular relating to the construction and management of a fleet with a variety of proposed improvements and we are persuaded that he will be found a valuable acquisition to our country <\s>
<s> _april 9th since writing the above we received despatches from the congress by captain hammond others from mr morris by captain bell and some copies by captain adams via boston which on many accounts were very satisfactory <\s>
<s> we directly drew up and presented memorials on the subject of those despatches we were promised immediate consideration and speedy answers for which we detained captain hammond but we have not yet obtained them <\s>
<s> we receive however continual assurances of the good will of this court and of spain <\s>
<s> we are given to understand that it is by their operations the raising of german troops for england has been obstructed <\s>
<s> we are paid punctually the second five hundred thousand livres and having convinced the ministry of the great importance of keeping up the credit and fixing the value of our currency which might be done by paying in specie the interest of what we borrow or in bills upon france for the amount <\s>
<s> we are now assured that the abovementioned quarterly payments shall be continued after the two millions for the purpose of paying the interest of the five million dollars you are supposed to have borrowed which we believe will be punctually complied with and the effect must be restoring to its original value the principal for which such interest is paid and with that the rest of the emission <\s>
<s> we have turned our thoughts earnestly to what is recommended to us by congress the borrowing two millions sterling in europe <\s>
<s> we just proposed to borrow it of this court upon interest but were told by the minister that it was impossible to spare such a sum as they were now arming at a great expense which kept their treasury bare but there was no objection to our borrowing it of private capitalists here provided we did not offer so high an interest as might raise it upon government <\s>
<s> we are advised to try holland and we have caused the pulse to be felt there but though holland at present is a little disgusted with england and our credit is considerably mended in europe by our late successes it does not yet appear sufficient to procure such a loan <\s>
<s> spain it seems has by its punctual payments of interest acquired high credit there and we are told that by her publicly borrowing as for herself and privately allowing us to draw on her banker we might there obtain what money we pleased <\s>
<s> mr lee was gone to spain before the commission and orders came to doctor franklin for that station he will give you a particular account of his negotiations we here only mention that he received the same general assurances of the good will of that court that we have here of this he was informed that three thousand barrels of powder and some clothing were lodged for our use at new orleans that some merchants at bilboa had orders to ship for us such necessaries as we might want that orders would be given to allow us admission into the havanna as a favored nation and that we should have a credit on holland the sum not then settled which might be expected at paris the beginning of this month <\s>
<s> the spanish ambassador here a grave and wise man to whom mr lee communicated the above tells us that his court piques itself on a religious observance of its word and that we may rely on a punctual performance of its promises <\s>
<s> _on these grounds we are of opinion that though we should not be able to borrow the two millions sterling recommended to us yet if the congress are obliged to borrow the whole twenty millions of dollars they have issued we hope to find sufficient here by way of subsidy to pay the interest in full value whereby the credit of their currency will be established and on great and urgent occasions they may venture to make an addition to it which we conceive will be better than paying the interest of two millions sterling to foreigners <\s>
<s> on the whole we would advise congress to draw on us for sums equal to the interest of what they have borrowed as that interest becomes due allowing the lenders in the drafts five livres money of france for every dollar of interest <\s>
<s> and we think they may venture to promise it for future loans without however mentioning the grounds we here give for making such a promise for these courts have particularly strong reasons for keeping out of the war as long as they can besides this general one that on both sides the nation attacking loses the claim which when attacked it has for aid from its allies <\s>
<s> and we have these advantages in their keeping out of the war that they are better able to afford us private assistance that by holding themselves in readiness to invade britain they keep more of her force at home and that they leave to our armed vessels the whole harvest of prizes made upon her commerce and of course the whole encouragement to increase our force in privateers which will breed seamen for our navy <\s>
<s> the desire that military officers here of all ranks have of going into the service of the united states is so general and so strong as to be quite amazing <\s>
<s> we are hourly fatigued with their applications and offers which we are obliged to refuse and with hundreds of letters which we cannot possibly answer to their satisfaction having had no orders to engage any but engineers who are accordingly gone <\s>
<s> if the congress think fit to encourage some of distinguished merit to enter their service they will please to signify it <\s>
<s> captain wickes made a cruise this winter and returned with five prizes of the produce of which we suppose mr morris will acquaint you for they are sold though the bringing them into france has given some trouble and uneasiness to the court and must not be too frequently practised <\s>
<s> we have ordered him to make another cruise before he returns to america and have given him for a consort the armed cutter captain nicholson they will sail in a few days <\s>
<s> mr hodge writes us that he has provided another cutter we intended to have employed one of them as a packet but several of yours being now here and having lately made a contract for sending one every month a copy of which we enclose we shall make use of this new purchase as a cruiser <\s>
<s> we have at length finished a contract with the farmers-general for five thousand hogsheads of tobacco a copy of which is enclosed <\s>
<s> we shall receive the first advance of two millions of livres next month and we entreat you to use your best endeavors to enable us to comply with our part of the agreement <\s>
<s> we found it a measure of government to furnish us by that means with large advances as well as to obtain the ground of some of their own taxes and finding the minister anxious to have such a treaty concluded we complied with the terms though we apprehend them not to be otherwise very advantageous <\s>
<s> we have expectations however that in case it appears that the tobacco cannot be afforded so cheap through captures c <\s>
<s> government will not suffer us to be losers <\s>
<s> we have purchased eighty thousand fusils a number of pistols c <\s>
<s> of which the enclosed is an account for two hundred and twenty thousand livres <\s>
<s> they were king's arms and second hand but so many of them are unused and unexceptionably good that we esteem it a great bargain if only half of them should arrive <\s>
<s> we applied for the large brass cannon to be borrowed out of the king's stores till we could replace them but have not yet obtained an answer <\s>
<s> you will soon have the arms and accoutrements for the horse except the saddles if not intercepted by the enemy <\s>
<s> all europe is for us <\s>
<s> our articles of confederation being by our means translated and published here have given an appearance of consistence and firmness to the american states and government that begins to make them considerable <\s>
<s> the separate constitutions of the several states are also translating and publishing here which afford abundance of speculation to the politicians of europe and it is a very general opinion that if we succeed in establishing our liberties we shall as soon as peace is restored receive an immense addition of numbers and wealth from europe by the families who will come over to participate in our privileges and bring their estates with them <\s>
<s> tyranny is so generally established in the rest of the world that the prospect of an asylum in america for those who love liberty gives general joy and our cause is esteemed the cause of all mankind <\s>
<s> slaves naturally become base as well as wretched <\s>
<s> we are fighting for the dignity and happiness of human nature <\s>
<s> glorious is it for the americans to be called by providence to this post of honor <\s>
<s> cursed and detested will every one be that deserts or betrays it <\s>
<s> we are glad to learn the intention of congress to send ministers to the empires of prussia and tuscany <\s>
<s> with submission we think holland denmark sweden and russia if the expense is no objection should not be neglected <\s>
<s> it would be of great service if among them we could get a free port or two for the sale of prizes as well as for commerce <\s>
<s> a commencement of intercourse has been made with prussia as you will see by the enclosed copies of letters 31 between his minister and us <\s>
<s> we suppose as the congress has appointed one of us to spain they will order another of us to some of the other courts as we see no utility equal to the charge and yet some inconveniency in a joint commission here where one when freed from commercial cares and action is sufficient for the business <\s>
<s> as soon as the court of spain shall be willing to receive a minister which from mr lee's information seems not to be at present the case mr franklin intends to go thither in obedience to the orders he has received <\s>
<s> mr lee has expressed his readiness to go to prussia or tuscany before the intention of congress to send to those courts was known and he waits here awhile by the advice of his colleagues expecting that perhaps the next ship may bring his future destination <\s>
<s> for the procuring and sending more certain and speedy intelligence we have as before mentioned entered into a contract here whereby we are to have a packet boat despatched every month the first will sail in about a fortnight <\s>
<s> as we are yet without an explicit answer from court on several important points and we shall have that speedy opportunity we do not now enlarge in answer to the several letters received by hammond bell adams and johnston <\s>
<s> we only now assure the congress that we shall be attentive to execute all the resolutions and orders they have sent us for our government and we have good hopes of success in most of them <\s>
<s> for news we refer in general to the papers and to some letters 32 enclosed which we have received from london <\s>
<s> we shall only add that though the english begin again to threaten us with twenty thousand russians it is the opinion of the wisest men here and particularly among the foreign ministers that they will never be sent <\s>
<s> the anspachers who were to be embarked in holland mutined and refused to proceed so that the prince was obliged to go with his guards and force them on <\s>
<s> a gentleman of rotterdam writes us that he saw a number of them brought bound hands and feet to that place in boats <\s>
<s> this does not seem as if much service can be expected from such unwilling soldiers <\s>
<s> the british fleet is not yet half manned the difficulty in that respect was never before found so great and is ascribed to several causes viz <\s>
<s> a dislike to the war the subtraction of american sailors the number our privateers have taken out of british ships and the enormous transport service <\s>
<s> the french are free from this difficulty their seamen being all registered and serving in their turns <\s>
<s> their fleet is nearly ready and will be much superior to the english when joined with that of spain which is preparing with all diligence <\s>
<s> the tone of the court accordingly rises and it is said that a few days since when the british ambassador intimated to the minister that if the americans were permitted to continue drawing supplies of arms c <\s>
<s> from this kingdom the peace could not last much longer he was firmly answered--_nous ne desirons pas le guerre mais nous ne la craigons pas we neither desire war nor fear it <\s>
<s> when all are ready for it a small matter may suddenly bring it on and it is the universal opinion that the peace cannot continue another year <\s>
<s> every nation in europe wishes to see britain humbled having all in their turns been offended by her insolence which in prosperity she is apt to discover on all occasions <\s>
<s> gentlemen we send you herewith the draft of a frigate by a very ingenious officer in this service which appears to us peculiarly suitable for our purpose and we are in hopes of being able to ship cordage sailcloth and anchors c <\s>

<s> gentlemen it is now more than four months since mr franklin's departure from philadelphia and not a line from thence written since that time has hitherto reached either of your commissioners in europe <\s>
<s> we have had no information of what passes in america but through england and the advices are for the most part such only as the ministry choose to publish <\s>
<s> our total ignorance of the truth or falsehood of facts when questions are asked of us concerning them makes us appear small in the eyes of the people here and is prejudicial to our negotiations <\s>

<s> we have succeeded in getting one from dover in which we purpose to send our present despatches <\s>
<s> mr hodge who went to dunkirk and flushing where he thought another might be easily found has not yet acquainted us with his success <\s>
<s> we promised that when we had a conveyance which by its swiftness is more likely to carry safely our letters we would be more explicit in accounts of our proceedings here which promise we shall now fulfil as follows <\s>
<s> in our first conversation with the minister after the arrival of mr franklin it was evident that this court while it treated us privately with all civility was cautious of giving umbrage to england and was therefore desirous of avoiding an open reception and acknowledgment of us or entering into any formal negotiation with us as ministers from the congress <\s>
<s> to make us easy however we were told that the ports of france were open to our ships as friends that our people might freely purchase and export as merchandise whatever our states had occasion for vending at the same time our own commodities that in doing this we should experience all the facilities that a government disposed to favor us could consistent with treaties afford to the enemies of a friend <\s>
<s> but though it was at that time no secret that two hundred field pieces of brass and thirty thousand fusils with other munitions of war in great abundance had been taken out of the king's magazines for the purpose of exportation to america the minister in our presence affected to know nothing of that operation and claimed no merit to his court on that account <\s>
<s> but he intimated to us that it would be well taken if we communicated with no other person about the court concerning our affairs but himself who would be ready at all convenient times to confer with us <\s>
<s> we soon after presented several memorials representing the state of the colonies the necessity of some naval aid and the utility to france that must result from our success in establishing the independence of america with the freedom of its commerce <\s>
<s> in answer we received a positive refusal of the ships of the line which we had been instructed to ask on this principle that if a war with england should take place the whole fleet of france would be necessary at home for her defence that if such a war did not take place yet while england apprehended a war it was equally serviceable to our states that the fleet of france should remain entire in her ports since that must retain an equal force of english at home who might otherwise go to america and who certainly would follow thither any french squadron <\s>
<s> during these conferences every step was taken to gratify england publicly by attending to the remonstrances of her ambassador forbidding the departure of ships which had military stores on board 29 recalling officers who had leave of absence and were going to join us and giving strict orders that our prizes should not be sold in french ports yet that we might not be discouraged it was intimated to us by persons about the court that these measures were necessary at present france not being yet quite ready for a war and that we might be assured of her good will to us and our cause <\s>
<s> means were proposed of our obtaining a large sum of money for present use by an advance from the farmers-general to be repaid in tobacco of which they wanted twenty thousand hogsheads <\s>
<s> we entered accordingly into a treaty with that company but meeting with difficulty in settling the terms we were informed that a grant was made us of two millions of livres from the crown of which five hundred thousand was ready to be paid us down and an equal sum should be paid at the beginning of april july and october that such was the king's generosity he exacted no conditions or promise of repayment he only required that we should not speak to any one of our having received this aid <\s>
<s> we have accordingly observed strictly this injunction deviating only in this information to you which we think necessary for your satisfaction but earnestly requesting that you would not suffer it to be made public <\s>
<s> this is the money which in our letter we mentioned as raised for us by subscription <\s>
<s> one of the ablest sea officers of france skilled in all the arts relating to the marine having offered his services to the states with the permission of the minister we enabled by the above grant engaged him to superintend the building of two ships of war of a particular construction which though not of half the cost shall be superior in force and utility to ships of sixtyfour guns <\s>
<s> he has built one here for the king which we are told exceeds every thing in swift sailing <\s>
<s> he has furnished us with drafts 30 which we send you that if the congress thinks fit others of the same construction may be set up in america in which case we have given him expectations of being their commodore <\s>
<s> we have seen his large and curious collection of memoirs containing every the minutest particular relating to the construction and management of a fleet with a variety of proposed improvements and we are persuaded that he will be found a valuable acquisition to our country <\s>
<s> _april 9th since writing the above we received despatches from the congress by captain hammond others from mr morris by captain bell and some copies by captain adams via boston which on many accounts were very satisfactory <\s>
<s> we directly drew up and presented memorials on the subject of those despatches we were promised immediate consideration and speedy answers for which we detained captain hammond but we have not yet obtained them <\s>
<s> we receive however continual assurances of the good will of this court and of spain <\s>
<s> we are given to understand that it is by their operations the raising of german troops for england has been obstructed <\s>
<s> we are paid punctually the second five hundred thousand livres and having convinced the ministry of the great importance of keeping up the credit and fixing the value of our currency which might be done by paying in specie the interest of what we borrow or in bills upon france for the amount <\s>
<s> we are now assured that the abovementioned quarterly payments shall be continued after the two millions for the purpose of paying the interest of the five million dollars you are supposed to have borrowed which we believe will be punctually complied with and the effect must be restoring to its original value the principal for which such interest is paid and with that the rest of the emission <\s>
<s> we have turned our thoughts earnestly to what is recommended to us by congress the borrowing two millions sterling in europe <\s>
<s> we just proposed to borrow it of this court upon interest but were told by the minister that it was impossible to spare such a sum as they were now arming at a great expense which kept their treasury bare but there was no objection to our borrowing it of private capitalists here provided we did not offer so high an interest as might raise it upon government <\s>
<s> we are advised to try holland and we have caused the pulse to be felt there but though holland at present is a little disgusted with england and our credit is considerably mended in europe by our late successes it does not yet appear sufficient to procure such a loan <\s>
<s> spain it seems has by its punctual payments of interest acquired high credit there and we are told that by her publicly borrowing as for herself and privately allowing us to draw on her banker we might there obtain what money we pleased <\s>
<s> mr lee was gone to spain before the commission and orders came to doctor franklin for that station he will give you a particular account of his negotiations we here only mention that he received the same general assurances of the good will of that court that we have here of this he was informed that three thousand barrels of powder and some clothing were lodged for our use at new orleans that some merchants at bilboa had orders to ship for us such necessaries as we might want that orders would be given to allow us admission into the havanna as a favored nation and that we should have a credit on holland the sum not then settled which might be expected at paris the beginning of this month <\s>
<s> the spanish ambassador here a grave and wise man to whom mr lee communicated the above tells us that his court piques itself on a religious observance of its word and that we may rely on a punctual performance of its promises <\s>
<s> _on these grounds we are of opinion that though we should not be able to borrow the two millions sterling recommended to us yet if the congress are obliged to borrow the whole twenty millions of dollars they have issued we hope to find sufficient here by way of subsidy to pay the interest in full value whereby the credit of their currency will be established and on great and urgent occasions they may venture to make an addition to it which we conceive will be better than paying the interest of two millions sterling to foreigners <\s>
<s> on the whole we would advise congress to draw on us for sums equal to the interest of what they have borrowed as that interest becomes due allowing the lenders in the drafts five livres money of france for every dollar of interest <\s>
<s> and we think they may venture to promise it for future loans without however mentioning the grounds we here give for making such a promise for these courts have particularly strong reasons for keeping out of the war as long as they can besides this general one that on both sides the nation attacking loses the claim which when attacked it has for aid from its allies <\s>
<s> and we have these advantages in their keeping out of the war that they are better able to afford us private assistance that by holding themselves in readiness to invade britain they keep more of her force at home and that they leave to our armed vessels the whole harvest of prizes made upon her commerce and of course the whole encouragement to increase our force in privateers which will breed seamen for our navy <\s>
<s> the desire that military officers here of all ranks have of going into the service of the united states is so general and so strong as to be quite amazing <\s>
<s> we are hourly fatigued with their applications and offers which we are obliged to refuse and with hundreds of letters which we cannot possibly answer to their satisfaction having had no orders to engage any but engineers who are accordingly gone <\s>
<s> if the congress think fit to encourage some of distinguished merit to enter their service they will please to signify it <\s>
<s> captain wickes made a cruise this winter and returned with five prizes of the produce of which we suppose mr morris will acquaint you for they are sold though the bringing them into france has given some trouble and uneasiness to the court and must not be too frequently practised <\s>
<s> we have ordered him to make another cruise before he returns to america and have given him for a consort the armed cutter captain nicholson they will sail in a few days <\s>
<s> mr hodge writes us that he has provided another cutter we intended to have employed one of them as a packet but several of yours being now here and having lately made a contract for sending one every month a copy of which we enclose we shall make use of this new purchase as a cruiser <\s>

<s> we shall receive the first advance of two millions of livres next month and we entreat you to use your best endeavors to enable us to comply with our part of the agreement <\s>
<s> we found it a measure of government to furnish us by that means with large advances as well as to obtain the ground of some of their own taxes and finding the minister anxious to have such a treaty concluded we complied with the terms though we apprehend them not to be otherwise very advantageous <\s>
<s> we have expectations however that in case it appears that the tobacco cannot be afforded so cheap through captures c <\s>

<s> gentlemen it is now more than four months since mr franklin's departure from philadelphia and not a line from thence written since that time has hitherto reached either of your commissioners in europe <\s>
<s> we have had no information of what passes in america but through england and the advices are for the most part such only as the ministry choose to publish <\s>
<s> our total ignorance of the truth or falsehood of facts when questions are asked of us concerning them makes us appear small in the eyes of the people here and is prejudicial to our negotiations <\s>
<s> in ours of the 6th of february of which a copy is enclosed we acquainted you that we were about purchasing some cutters to be employed as packet boats <\s>
<s> we have succeeded in getting one from dover in which we purpose to send our present despatches <\s>
<s> mr hodge who went to dunkirk and flushing where he thought another might be easily found has not yet acquainted us with his success <\s>
<s> we promised that when we had a conveyance which by its swiftness is more likely to carry safely our letters we would be more explicit in accounts of our proceedings here which promise we shall now fulfil as follows <\s>
<s> in our first conversation with the minister after the arrival of mr franklin it was evident that this court while it treated us privately with all civility was cautious of giving umbrage to england and was therefore desirous of avoiding an open reception and acknowledgment of us or entering into any formal negotiation with us as ministers from the congress <\s>
<s> to make us easy however we were told that the ports of france were open to our ships as friends that our people might freely purchase and export as merchandise whatever our states had occasion for vending at the same time our own commodities that in doing this we should experience all the facilities that a government disposed to favor us could consistent with treaties afford to the enemies of a friend <\s>
<s> but though it was at that time no secret that two hundred field pieces of brass and thirty thousand fusils with other munitions of war in great abundance had been taken out of the king's magazines for the purpose of exportation to america the minister in our presence affected to know nothing of that operation and claimed no merit to his court on that account <\s>
<s> but he intimated to us that it would be well taken if we communicated with no other person about the court concerning our affairs but himself who would be ready at all convenient times to confer with us <\s>
<s> we soon after presented several memorials representing the state of the colonies the necessity of some naval aid and the utility to france that must result from our success in establishing the independence of america with the freedom of its commerce <\s>
<s> in answer we received a positive refusal of the ships of the line which we had been instructed to ask on this principle that if a war with england should take place the whole fleet of france would be necessary at home for her defence that if such a war did not take place yet while england apprehended a war it was equally serviceable to our states that the fleet of france should remain entire in her ports since that must retain an equal force of english at home who might otherwise go to america and who certainly would follow thither any french squadron <\s>
<s> during these conferences every step was taken to gratify england publicly by attending to the remonstrances of her ambassador forbidding the departure of ships which had military stores on board 29 recalling officers who had leave of absence and were going to join us and giving strict orders that our prizes should not be sold in french ports yet that we might not be discouraged it was intimated to us by persons about the court that these measures were necessary at present france not being yet quite ready for a war and that we might be assured of her good will to us and our cause <\s>
<s> means were proposed of our obtaining a large sum of money for present use by an advance from the farmers-general to be repaid in tobacco of which they wanted twenty thousand hogsheads <\s>
<s> we entered accordingly into a treaty with that company but meeting with difficulty in settling the terms we were informed that a grant was made us of two millions of livres from the crown of which five hundred thousand was ready to be paid us down and an equal sum should be paid at the beginning of april july and october that such was the king's generosity he exacted no conditions or promise of repayment he only required that we should not speak to any one of our having received this aid <\s>
<s> we have accordingly observed strictly this injunction deviating only in this information to you which we think necessary for your satisfaction but earnestly requesting that you would not suffer it to be made public <\s>
<s> this is the money which in our letter we mentioned as raised for us by subscription <\s>
<s> one of the ablest sea officers of france skilled in all the arts relating to the marine having offered his services to the states with the permission of the minister we enabled by the above grant engaged him to superintend the building of two ships of war of a particular construction which though not of half the cost shall be superior in force and utility to ships of sixtyfour guns <\s>
<s> he has built one here for the king which we are told exceeds every thing in swift sailing <\s>
<s> he has furnished us with drafts 30 which we send you that if the congress thinks fit others of the same construction may be set up in america in which case we have given him expectations of being their commodore <\s>
<s> we have seen his large and curious collection of memoirs containing every the minutest particular relating to the construction and management of a fleet with a variety of proposed improvements and we are persuaded that he will be found a valuable acquisition to our country <\s>
<s> _april 9th since writing the above we received despatches from the congress by captain hammond others from mr morris by captain bell and some copies by captain adams via boston which on many accounts were very satisfactory <\s>
<s> we directly drew up and presented memorials on the subject of those despatches we were promised immediate consideration and speedy answers for which we detained captain hammond but we have not yet obtained them <\s>
<s> we receive however continual assurances of the good will of this court and of spain <\s>
<s> we are given to understand that it is by their operations the raising of german troops for england has been obstructed <\s>
<s> we are paid punctually the second five hundred thousand livres and having convinced the ministry of the great importance of keeping up the credit and fixing the value of our currency which might be done by paying in specie the interest of what we borrow or in bills upon france for the amount <\s>
<s> we are now assured that the abovementioned quarterly payments shall be continued after the two millions for the purpose of paying the interest of the five million dollars you are supposed to have borrowed which we believe will be punctually complied with and the effect must be restoring to its original value the principal for which such interest is paid and with that the rest of the emission <\s>
<s> we have turned our thoughts earnestly to what is recommended to us by congress the borrowing two millions sterling in europe <\s>
<s> we just proposed to borrow it of this court upon interest but were told by the minister that it was impossible to spare such a sum as they were now arming at a great expense which kept their treasury bare but there was no objection to our borrowing it of private capitalists here provided we did not offer so high an interest as might raise it upon government <\s>
<s> we are advised to try holland and we have caused the pulse to be felt there but though holland at present is a little disgusted with england and our credit is considerably mended in europe by our late successes it does not yet appear sufficient to procure such a loan <\s>
<s> spain it seems has by its punctual payments of interest acquired high credit there and we are told that by her publicly borrowing as for herself and privately allowing us to draw on her banker we might there obtain what money we pleased <\s>
<s> mr lee was gone to spain before the commission and orders came to doctor franklin for that station he will give you a particular account of his negotiations we here only mention that he received the same general assurances of the good will of that court that we have here of this he was informed that three thousand barrels of powder and some clothing were lodged for our use at new orleans that some merchants at bilboa had orders to ship for us such necessaries as we might want that orders would be given to allow us admission into the havanna as a favored nation and that we should have a credit on holland the sum not then settled which might be expected at paris the beginning of this month <\s>
<s> the spanish ambassador here a grave and wise man to whom mr lee communicated the above tells us that his court piques itself on a religious observance of its word and that we may rely on a punctual performance of its promises <\s>
<s> _on these grounds we are of opinion that though we should not be able to borrow the two millions sterling recommended to us yet if the congress are obliged to borrow the whole twenty millions of dollars they have issued we hope to find sufficient here by way of subsidy to pay the interest in full value whereby the credit of their currency will be established and on great and urgent occasions they may venture to make an addition to it which we conceive will be better than paying the interest of two millions sterling to foreigners <\s>
<s> on the whole we would advise congress to draw on us for sums equal to the interest of what they have borrowed as that interest becomes due allowing the lenders in the drafts five livres money of france for every dollar of interest <\s>
<s> and we think they may venture to promise it for future loans without however mentioning the grounds we here give for making such a promise for these courts have particularly strong reasons for keeping out of the war as long as they can besides this general one that on both sides the nation attacking loses the claim which when attacked it has for aid from its allies <\s>
<s> and we have these advantages in their keeping out of the war that they are better able to afford us private assistance that by holding themselves in readiness to invade britain they keep more of her force at home and that they leave to our armed vessels the whole harvest of prizes made upon her commerce and of course the whole encouragement to increase our force in privateers which will breed seamen for our navy <\s>
<s> the desire that military officers here of all ranks have of going into the service of the united states is so general and so strong as to be quite amazing <\s>
<s> we are hourly fatigued with their applications and offers which we are obliged to refuse and with hundreds of letters which we cannot possibly answer to their satisfaction having had no orders to engage any but engineers who are accordingly gone <\s>
<s> if the congress think fit to encourage some of distinguished merit to enter their service they will please to signify it <\s>
<s> captain wickes made a cruise this winter and returned with five prizes of the produce of which we suppose mr morris will acquaint you for they are sold though the bringing them into france has given some trouble and uneasiness to the court and must not be too frequently practised <\s>

<s> we have had no information of what passes in america but through england and the advices are for the most part such only as the ministry choose to publish <\s>
<s> our total ignorance of the truth or falsehood of facts when questions are asked of us concerning them makes us appear small in the eyes of the people here and is prejudicial to our negotiations <\s>

<s> we promised that when we had a conveyance which by its swiftness is more likely to carry safely our letters we would be more explicit in accounts of our proceedings here which promise we shall now fulfil as follows <\s>
<s> in our first conversation with the minister after the arrival of mr franklin it was evident that this court while it treated us privately with all civility was cautious of giving umbrage to england and was therefore desirous of avoiding an open reception and acknowledgment of us or entering into any formal negotiation with us as ministers from the congress <\s>
<s> to make us easy however we were told that the ports of france were open to our ships as friends that our people might freely purchase and export as merchandise whatever our states had occasion for vending at the same time our own commodities that in doing this we should experience all the facilities that a government disposed to favor us could consistent with treaties afford to the enemies of a friend <\s>
<s> but though it was at that time no secret that two hundred field pieces of brass and thirty thousand fusils with other munitions of war in great abundance had been taken out of the king's magazines for the purpose of exportation to america the minister in our presence affected to know nothing of that operation and claimed no merit to his court on that account <\s>
<s> but he intimated to us that it would be well taken if we communicated with no other person about the court concerning our affairs but himself who would be ready at all convenient times to confer with us <\s>
<s> we soon after presented several memorials representing the state of the colonies the necessity of some naval aid and the utility to france that must result from our success in establishing the independence of america with the freedom of its commerce <\s>
<s> in answer we received a positive refusal of the ships of the line which we had been instructed to ask on this principle that if a war with england should take place the whole fleet of france would be necessary at home for her defence that if such a war did not take place yet while england apprehended a war it was equally serviceable to our states that the fleet of france should remain entire in her ports since that must retain an equal force of english at home who might otherwise go to america and who certainly would follow thither any french squadron <\s>
<s> during these conferences every step was taken to gratify england publicly by attending to the remonstrances of her ambassador forbidding the departure of ships which had military stores on board 29 recalling officers who had leave of absence and were going to join us and giving strict orders that our prizes should not be sold in french ports yet that we might not be discouraged it was intimated to us by persons about the court that these measures were necessary at present france not being yet quite ready for a war and that we might be assured of her good will to us and our cause <\s>
<s> means were proposed of our obtaining a large sum of money for present use by an advance from the farmers-general to be repaid in tobacco of which they wanted twenty thousand hogsheads <\s>
<s> we entered accordingly into a treaty with that company but meeting with difficulty in settling the terms we were informed that a grant was made us of two millions of livres from the crown of which five hundred thousand was ready to be paid us down and an equal sum should be paid at the beginning of april july and october that such was the king's generosity he exacted no conditions or promise of repayment he only required that we should not speak to any one of our having received this aid <\s>
<s> we have accordingly observed strictly this injunction deviating only in this information to you which we think necessary for your satisfaction but earnestly requesting that you would not suffer it to be made public <\s>
<s> this is the money which in our letter we mentioned as raised for us by subscription <\s>
<s> one of the ablest sea officers of france skilled in all the arts relating to the marine having offered his services to the states with the permission of the minister we enabled by the above grant engaged him to superintend the building of two ships of war of a particular construction which though not of half the cost shall be superior in force and utility to ships of sixtyfour guns <\s>
<s> he has built one here for the king which we are told exceeds every thing in swift sailing <\s>
<s> he has furnished us with drafts 30 which we send you that if the congress thinks fit others of the same construction may be set up in america in which case we have given him expectations of being their commodore <\s>
<s> we have seen his large and curious collection of memoirs containing every the minutest particular relating to the construction and management of a fleet with a variety of proposed improvements and we are persuaded that he will be found a valuable acquisition to our country <\s>
<s> _april 9th since writing the above we received despatches from the congress by captain hammond others from mr morris by captain bell and some copies by captain adams via boston which on many accounts were very satisfactory <\s>
<s> we directly drew up and presented memorials on the subject of those despatches we were promised immediate consideration and speedy answers for which we detained captain hammond but we have not yet obtained them <\s>
<s> we receive however continual assurances of the good will of this court and of spain <\s>
<s> we are given to understand that it is by their operations the raising of german troops for england has been obstructed <\s>
<s> we are paid punctually the second five hundred thousand livres and having convinced the ministry of the great importance of keeping up the credit and fixing the value of our currency which might be done by paying in specie the interest of what we borrow or in bills upon france for the amount <\s>
<s> we are now assured that the abovementioned quarterly payments shall be continued after the two millions for the purpose of paying the interest of the five million dollars you are supposed to have borrowed which we believe will be punctually complied with and the effect must be restoring to its original value the principal for which such interest is paid and with that the rest of the emission <\s>
<s> we have turned our thoughts earnestly to what is recommended to us by congress the borrowing two millions sterling in europe <\s>
<s> we just proposed to borrow it of this court upon interest but were told by the minister that it was impossible to spare such a sum as they were now arming at a great expense which kept their treasury bare but there was no objection to our borrowing it of private capitalists here provided we did not offer so high an interest as might raise it upon government <\s>
<s> we are advised to try holland and we have caused the pulse to be felt there but though holland at present is a little disgusted with england and our credit is considerably mended in europe by our late successes it does not yet appear sufficient to procure such a loan <\s>

<s> on the whole we would advise congress to draw on us for sums equal to the interest of what they have borrowed as that interest becomes due allowing the lenders in the drafts five livres money of france for every dollar of interest <\s>

<s> gentlemen it is now more than four months since mr franklin's departure from philadelphia and not a line from thence written since that time has hitherto reached either of your commissioners in europe <\s>
<s> we have had no information of what passes in america but through england and the advices are for the most part such only as the ministry choose to publish <\s>
<s> our total ignorance of the truth or falsehood of facts when questions are asked of us concerning them makes us appear small in the eyes of the people here and is prejudicial to our negotiations <\s>

<s> we have succeeded in getting one from dover in which we purpose to send our present despatches <\s>
<s> mr hodge who went to dunkirk and flushing where he thought another might be easily found has not yet acquainted us with his success <\s>
<s> we promised that when we had a conveyance which by its swiftness is more likely to carry safely our letters we would be more explicit in accounts of our proceedings here which promise we shall now fulfil as follows <\s>
<s> in our first conversation with the minister after the arrival of mr franklin it was evident that this court while it treated us privately with all civility was cautious of giving umbrage to england and was therefore desirous of avoiding an open reception and acknowledgment of us or entering into any formal negotiation with us as ministers from the congress <\s>
<s> to make us easy however we were told that the ports of france were open to our ships as friends that our people might freely purchase and export as merchandise whatever our states had occasion for vending at the same time our own commodities that in doing this we should experience all the facilities that a government disposed to favor us could consistent with treaties afford to the enemies of a friend <\s>
<s> but though it was at that time no secret that two hundred field pieces of brass and thirty thousand fusils with other munitions of war in great abundance had been taken out of the king's magazines for the purpose of exportation to america the minister in our presence affected to know nothing of that operation and claimed no merit to his court on that account <\s>
<s> but he intimated to us that it would be well taken if we communicated with no other person about the court concerning our affairs but himself who would be ready at all convenient times to confer with us <\s>
<s> we soon after presented several memorials representing the state of the colonies the necessity of some naval aid and the utility to france that must result from our success in establishing the independence of america with the freedom of its commerce <\s>
<s> in answer we received a positive refusal of the ships of the line which we had been instructed to ask on this principle that if a war with england should take place the whole fleet of france would be necessary at home for her defence that if such a war did not take place yet while england apprehended a war it was equally serviceable to our states that the fleet of france should remain entire in her ports since that must retain an equal force of english at home who might otherwise go to america and who certainly would follow thither any french squadron <\s>
<s> during these conferences every step was taken to gratify england publicly by attending to the remonstrances of her ambassador forbidding the departure of ships which had military stores on board 29 recalling officers who had leave of absence and were going to join us and giving strict orders that our prizes should not be sold in french ports yet that we might not be discouraged it was intimated to us by persons about the court that these measures were necessary at present france not being yet quite ready for a war and that we might be assured of her good will to us and our cause <\s>
<s> means were proposed of our obtaining a large sum of money for present use by an advance from the farmers-general to be repaid in tobacco of which they wanted twenty thousand hogsheads <\s>
<s> we entered accordingly into a treaty with that company but meeting with difficulty in settling the terms we were informed that a grant was made us of two millions of livres from the crown of which five hundred thousand was ready to be paid us down and an equal sum should be paid at the beginning of april july and october that such was the king's generosity he exacted no conditions or promise of repayment he only required that we should not speak to any one of our having received this aid <\s>
<s> we have accordingly observed strictly this injunction deviating only in this information to you which we think necessary for your satisfaction but earnestly requesting that you would not suffer it to be made public <\s>
<s> this is the money which in our letter we mentioned as raised for us by subscription <\s>
<s> one of the ablest sea officers of france skilled in all the arts relating to the marine having offered his services to the states with the permission of the minister we enabled by the above grant engaged him to superintend the building of two ships of war of a particular construction which though not of half the cost shall be superior in force and utility to ships of sixtyfour guns <\s>
