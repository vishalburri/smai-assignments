<s> not a power in europe the king of prussia excepted can go to war without borrowing money of holland to a greater or less amount and whilst so many borrowers are in its neighborhood whose estates as i may say are settled and known it is not to be expected holland will be fond of lending money to the united states of north america though we should offer higher interest <\s>
<s> to offer a large interest might be tempting but it would be very ruinous to us and i conceive it will never be thought prudent to permit higher than five per cent interest in the states of north america and this is but one per cent more than is given in europe <\s>

<s> if this court will give a credit to that amount to any body of men in the kingdom that company may engage to pay the court the same amount in continental bills within a limited time this company may send to america supplies to that amount as the congress shall order such goods as are wanted either for the army or navy the congress will instantly deposit their bills for the amount the residue may be sold at a stated advance for continental bills the whole of the amount immediately put on interest to this court this will be the calling in of such an amount of the bills and of course give the greater currency to the whole <\s>
<s> meantime this court must become interested to have the commerce free by which alone remittances can be made <\s>
<s> this is but a sudden thought recommended to you for consideration if deemed worthy <\s>
<s> that something may be effected in this way i can have no doubt while i have this most unequivocal evidence <\s>
<s> i am now credited to the amount of all the supplies for thirty thousand men a train of artillery amounting to more than two hundred pieces of brass cannon ammunition c <\s>

<s> the most effectual card now played by the british ambassador is asserting that an accommodation will soon take place and by some means or other conjecturing my want of powers by my not appearing at court he is bold in this assertion and i find it the greatest difficulty i have to encounter <\s>

<s> i now discuss a subject which has given and still continues to give me as much anxiety as i can struggle with and mention another a little new but indeed somewhat connected with it it is the equipping of a number of american ships of war in the ports of france <\s>

<s> the honorable congress must i conceive either continue emitting bills or borrow money and i submit whether it be not better to borrow of foreign states than individuals in the present situation of american affairs i am convinced you may borrow five or six millions of holland on france becoming your security <\s>
<s> this i am confident may be obtained on application to this court and spain and that on these principles they can by no means be willing to permit the colonies to return to their former subjection to great britain armed as both countries are <\s>

<s> by which any imposition may be detected <\s>
<s> large remittances are necessary for your credit and the enormous price of tobacco of rice of flour and many other articles gives you an opportunity of making your remittances to very great advantage <\s>
<s> 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco are wanted immediately for this kingdom and more for other parts of europe <\s>
<s> i have written you on several subjects some of which i will attempt briefly to recapitulate <\s>
<s> the destruction of the newfoundland fishery may be effected by two or three of your frigates sent there early in february and by that means a fatal blow given to great britain i mean by destroying the stages boats c <\s>
<s> and by bringing away the people left there as prisoners <\s>
<s> glasgow in scotland may be plundered and burnt with ease as may liverpool by two or three frigates which may find a shelter and protection in the ports of france and spain afterwards <\s>
<s> blank commissions are wanted here to cruise under your flag against the british commerce <\s>
<s> this is a capital stroke and must bring on a war <\s>
<s> hasten them out i pray you <\s>
<s> france and spain are friendly and you will greatly oblige the latter by seizing the portuguese commerce whenever it is found <\s>
<s> i have had overtures from the king of prussia in the commercial way and have sent a person of great confidence to his court with letters of introduction from his agent here with whom i am on the best terms <\s>
<s> a loan may be obtained for any sums at five per cent interest perhaps less if you make punctual remittances for the sums now advanced <\s>
<s> the western lands ought to be held up to view as an encouragement for our soldiers especially foreigners and are a good fund to raise money on <\s>
<s> clugny prevented the loan and lowered the stocks <\s>
<s> clugny died last week and is succeeded ostensibly by one monsieur tabourou i say ostensibly for m <\s>
<s> necker a noted protestant banker is joined with him as intendant of the treasury <\s>
<s> this raised stocks immediately and i am told they have already risen ten per cent <\s>
<s> this is the most politic appointment that could have been made and it deserves our notice that where a man has it in his power to be of public service his principles of religion are not a sufficient obstacle to hinder his promotion even in france <\s>
<s> this will probably enable this kingdom to borrow money which from all appearances will be soon wanted <\s>
<s> spain from the punctuality of its payments of interest and its well known treasures is in high credit in holland <\s>
<s> denmark borrows at four per cent sweden at the same the emperor of germany from the security of his hereditary dominions and the empress of russia from her having lately paid part of the large sum she borrowed in the turkish wars are both of them in good credit <\s>
<s> the credit of great britain though it has not fallen yet it is in a critical situation with those foreseeing people who on receiving the news of the action on long island which raised stocks a trifle in england began immediately to sell out <\s>
<s> not a power in europe the king of prussia excepted can go to war without borrowing money of holland to a greater or less amount and whilst so many borrowers are in its neighborhood whose estates as i may say are settled and known it is not to be expected holland will be fond of lending money to the united states of north america though we should offer higher interest <\s>
<s> to offer a large interest might be tempting but it would be very ruinous to us and i conceive it will never be thought prudent to permit higher than five per cent interest in the states of north america and this is but one per cent more than is given in europe <\s>
<s> this view leads me again to reflect as i constantly do with the utmost grief on the unaccountable delay of proper authority announcing the independency of the united states and proposing terms of alliance and friendship with france and spain <\s>
<s> this i am confident would at once remove this and many other difficulties would put our affairs on the most established and respectable footing and oblige great britain herself to acknowledge our independency and court our friendship <\s>
<s> on such powers being received and presented these kingdoms i have no doubt would become our guaranty for the money we want and the produce of our country will be wanted for the interest and even the principal as fast as we can transport it hither <\s>
<s> but as no such powers and instructions are received and as it is possible you mean not to send any i will mention a few thoughts on another plan <\s>
<s> you are not in want of money but the effects of money in the manufactures of europe <\s>
<s> for these the colonies or united states must now have a demand to the amount of some millions sterling <\s>
<s> these manufactures are to be had principally in france and holland <\s>
<s> as to the latter they have not at present and are resolved never to have any peculiar connexion with or friendship for any power further than their commerce is served by it but that is not the ruling passion of the former <\s>
<s> the desire of humbling their old rival and hereditary enemy and aggrandizing their monarchy are predominant and never was there a more favorable opportunity than the present so favorable is it that were the funds of this kingdom in a little better situation and were they confident that the united states would abide by their independency not a moment's time would be lost in declaring war even though you had made no application direct <\s>
<s> whatever part this kingdom takes will be pursued by the court of madrid <\s>
<s> would this court give a credit even to private merchants it would answer the same purpose as a loan as for instance the united colonies want about three millions value of manufactures annually it has heretofore been a little more from europe <\s>
<s> if this court will give a credit to that amount to any body of men in the kingdom that company may engage to pay the court the same amount in continental bills within a limited time this company may send to america supplies to that amount as the congress shall order such goods as are wanted either for the army or navy the congress will instantly deposit their bills for the amount the residue may be sold at a stated advance for continental bills the whole of the amount immediately put on interest to this court this will be the calling in of such an amount of the bills and of course give the greater currency to the whole <\s>
<s> meantime this court must become interested to have the commerce free by which alone remittances can be made <\s>
<s> this is but a sudden thought recommended to you for consideration if deemed worthy <\s>
<s> that something may be effected in this way i can have no doubt while i have this most unequivocal evidence <\s>
<s> i am now credited to the amount of all the supplies for thirty thousand men a train of artillery amounting to more than two hundred pieces of brass cannon ammunition c <\s>
<s> which must be of near half a million sterling _not ostensibly by the court but by a private company <\s>
<s> at the same time other companies as well as individuals after offering any loan or credit i should ask always brought in sooner or later the condition of having my bills endorsed by some banker or person of credit where you are sensible in my situation the affair ended though in several instances i had the most flattering encouragement and expected most assuredly no security would be required but that this particular house should be able and willing to advance this prodigious sum at once and without security is no way surprising but perfectly consistent with what i have all along asserted <\s>
<s> the most effectual card now played by the british ambassador is asserting that an accommodation will soon take place and by some means or other conjecturing my want of powers by my not appearing at court he is bold in this assertion and i find it the greatest difficulty i have to encounter <\s>
<s> but i will not enter on a subject which has well nigh distracted me and embarrassed and disheartened in a greater or less degree every friend of america <\s>
<s> the late conduct of the court of spain respecting captain lee whose case i mentioned before is a striking proof of what i have so positively asserted of the good disposition of both these courts <\s>
<s> they dismissed the complaint against him afforded him protection with assurances of every assistance he might need declaring publicly that their ports were equally free for americans as for britons <\s>
<s> i have besides these overt acts still more convincing proofs that the moment your application is made every thing will be set in proper motion <\s>
<s> i now discuss a subject which has given and still continues to give me as much anxiety as i can struggle with and mention another a little new but indeed somewhat connected with it it is the equipping of a number of american ships of war in the ports of france <\s>
<s> considering the price of duck cordage ordnance and other military stores in america they may be built much cheaper here <\s>
