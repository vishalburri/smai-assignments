<s> sir i have received your letter of the 20th instant accompanied by the translation of the representations addressed to you by the american commissioners relative to the fears of the merchants of bordeaux and nantes who have hitherto transacted business with america and by the request of the commissioners with regard to the protection of that commerce <\s>
<s> for nearly a month the french coast along the bay of biscay and a part of that on the channel have been guarded by twenty frigates and corvettes distributed in the open sea as well as along the entrances of harbors and rivers <\s>
<s> those stationed at the latter places take under their protection the french and american ships which sail from those points and convoy them beyond the capes <\s>
<s> if they meet any vessels inward bound they convoy them to the entrance of the harbors <\s>
<s> the frigates stationed further out at sea are employed in chasing away the guernsey and jersey privateers which are a great interruption to commerce <\s>
<s> the same orders have been issued in the colonies where the frigates there stationed convoy the french and american vessels from the coasts <\s>
<s> the reports made to me assure me that these orders are promptly executed and that the protection is extended as fully to american as to french vessels <\s>
<s> you will agree with me that this kind of protection is for the present the only one which it is possible to give to commerce and that convoys to america would be impracticable under present circumstances and are always insecure and subject to great inconveniences <\s>
<s> to protect the coasts to assure a free access to the harbors to remove the privateers and afford a convoy beyond the capes these aids commerce requires and has a right to expect and they have long since been provided by the orders of his majesty <\s>
<s> the commissioners cannot reasonably complain when in this respect the american vessels are on an equal footing with those of his majesty's subjects <\s>

<s> sir herewith you have in triplicate and copy of my former letters <\s>
<s> i now send you the proceedings of congress upon an appearance of the draughts of two bills said to have been read to the british parliament <\s>
<s> since congress took notice of them governor tryon has sent out from new york copies of them with greater marks of authenticity than those bore which first came to hand <\s>
<s> he certifies that he has his majesty's command to cause them to be printed and dispersed that the people at large may be acquainted with the contents and of the favorable disposition of great britain towards the american colonies <\s>
<s> i will not attempt to lead your judgment upon these proceedings of our enemies <\s>
<s> i will only add one anecdote of their late conduct nearly allied to that of counterfeiting our continental currency <\s>
<s> they have published in all our forms a forged resolve of congress purporting a consignment of power to general washington to detain in his army _during the war all militia men who have enlisted or been draughted for nine months or a year and to treat as deserters such as attempt to leave him at the expiration of their present agreement <\s>

<s> from the committee of foreign affairs to the commissioners <\s>
<s> york 30th april 1778 <\s>
<s> gentlemen by the gazettes which accompany this letter you will see that the enemy are entering upon a plan which must shortly perplex us much unless we receive despatches from you to enlighten us as to your situation and transactions of which we have had no information since the latter end of may <\s>
<s> as we have heard of the loss of captain johnston and captain wickes and know that john folger was robbed we cannot charge our present want of letters to negligence in you but we think you should not rest satisfied without sending triplicates of all your despatches <\s>
<s> the commercial committee will transmit to you the contract which they have entered into with the agent of the house of _roderique hortalez co the heads of which contract happening to be at hand are enclosed <\s>
<s> we have read a letter written by a friend dated house of commons february 13th in which we are told that you had concluded a treaty with france and spain which was on the water towards us <\s>
<s> imagine how solicitous we are to know the truth of this before we receive any proposals from britain in consequence of the scheme in lord north's speech and the two draughts of bills now sent to you <\s>
<s> the state of our foreign connexions is a subject now before congress and dubious as we are about your transactions some resolutions will probably be formed to be transmitted to you by a special conveyance shortly when a general account of our affairs will also be sent <\s>
<s> we have little uneasiness about the strength of our enemy <\s>
<s> our currency must be supported in due credit after which we may bid defiance to britain and all her german hirelings <\s>

<s> judge therefore sir how very agreeable your letters must have been to us though you wrote but briefly always supposing that we received more full accounts of european politics from our friends at paris <\s>

<s> we must refer you to the prints now sent and to our commissioners for the general state of our affairs only remarking here that we were actuated in our proceedings on the 22d of april entirely by the uniform spirit which we have maintained ever since the 4th of july 1776 being not then acquainted with the favorable state of our cause in france as an uncommon fatality had attended the letters of our friends for nearly a whole year before the arrival of their present important packet <\s>

<s> gentlemen our affairs have now a universally good appearance <\s>
<s> every thing at home and abroad seems verging towards a happy and permanent period <\s>
<s> we are preparing for either war or peace <\s>
<s> for although we are fully persuaded that our enemies are wearied beaten and in despair yet we shall not presume too much on that persuasion and the rather because it is our fixed determination to admit no terms of peace but such as are fully in character with the dignity of independent states and consistent with the spirit and intention of our alliances on the continent of europe <\s>
<s> we believe and with great reason too that the honor and fortitude of america have been rendered _suspicious_ in europe by the arts intrigue and specious misrepresentations of our enemies there <\s>
<s> every proceeding and policy of ours have been tortured to give some possible coloring to their assertions of a _doubtful disposition in america as to her perseverance in maintaining her independency and perhaps the speeches of many of the minority of both houses in the english parliament who seem to persist in the probability of a reconciliation may have contributed towards a continuance of that suspicion <\s>
<s> but we at this particular time feel ourselves exceedingly happy in a proof from the accidental arrangement of circumstances such as we could neither foresee nor alter that the disposition of america on that head was fixed and final <\s>
<s> for this proof we desire your attention to what follows <\s>
<s> the english ministry appear to have been very industrious in getting over to america as soon as possible their two conciliatory bills even before they had been once read the reason of which haste we did not then see but the arrival of your despatches since with the treaties has unriddled that affair <\s>
<s> general howe was equally industrious in circulating them by his emissaries through the country and likewise sent them under a flag to general washington who immediately despatched them to congress on the of april <\s>
<s> they were in themselves truly unworthy of the attention of that public body but lest the silence of congress should be misunderstood or furnish the enemy with new ground for false insinuation they were referred to a committee whose judicious and spirited report thereon was unanimously approved in the house on the 22d then published and circulated through the several states with all possible expedition <\s>
<s> the despatches in charge of mr simeon deane did not arrive till the 2d of may ten days after the said reports were published and his expedition in bringing his papers to congress prevented any intelligence from arriving before him <\s>
<s> enclosed are the reports referred to which we recommend to your attention to make as public as possible in europe prefacing them with such an explanatory detail of the before mentioned circumstances as shall have a tendency to place the politics of america on the firm basis of national honor integrity and fortitude <\s>
<s> we admire the wisdom and true dignity of the court of france on their part of the construction and ratification of the treaties between us <\s>
<s> they have a powerful tendency to dissolve effectually that narrowness of mind which mankind have been too unhappily bred up in <\s>
<s> those treaties discover the politician founded on the philosopher and a harmony of affections made the groundwork of mutual interest <\s>
