<s> sir i have the honor to transmit to you herewith the declaration which i am authorised to make in order to prevent any mistake as to the intentions of the burgomasters of the city of amsterdam since it will be made evident by the above mentioned declaration that they have not the absurd design of concluding a convention independently of their high mightinesses but only to make such preparations as are possible to accelerate the conclusion of a treaty of commerce when the opportunity shall present <\s>
<s> it is plain that a treaty of commerce cannot be concluded unless the principal commercial city of the republic gives its consent thereto and that it cannot give its consent without having examined the terms <\s>
<s> this examination may as well precede as follow the acknowledgment of the independence of america by the english in which case we should gain much time <\s>
<s> with regard to the terms i will explain my own views sir in a very few words viz <\s>
<s> that in general we should grant each other mutually all the facilities necessary to render commerce as free as possible and that for this purpose we should take the treaty between france and america as the basis changing nothing except those provisions which cannot be applicable in the republic <\s>
<s> if this principle accord with the views of congress on this subject i will have the above mentioned treaty examined by experienced merchants and communicate to you their opinion with regard to the additions or omissions necessary to negotiate a treaty of commerce between the republic and the united states of america on that basis <\s>
<s> if you wish for any further explanations i beg you sir to give me information but i think the views i have proposed so simple that nothing further will be necessary <\s>

<s> the undersigned pentionary of the city of amsterdam has the honor to make known to those who are duly authorised by the congress of the united states of america that he is empowered by the burgomasters of the aforementioned city to declare in their names that provided the said congress do not enter into any engagements with the english commissioners which may be hurtful or prejudicial to the commerce of the republic of the united provinces directly or indirectly the aforesaid burgomasters on their side will be entirely disposed as far as depends on them so to direct the course of affairs that whenever the independence of the said united states of america shall be recognised by the english a perpetual treaty of amity shall be concluded between this republic and the aforesaid united states containing the most extensive reciprocal advantages in relation to the commerce of the subjects of the two powers <\s>
<s> the undersigned has the honor further to declare that it is the will of said burgomasters that this declaration may be employed as shall be thought expedient with the necessary precaution that it shall not come to the knowledge of those interested to prevent if possible or at least to obstruct the execution of a plan which has no other object than to promote mutual happiness and the true interests of the two republics <\s>

<s> as congress have intrusted to us the authority of treating with all the states of europe excepting such as have a particular commission designed by congress to treat with them and as no particular commissioner has been appointed to treat with their high mightinesses we have already taken such measures as appeared to us suitable to accomplish so desirable a purpose as a friendship between nations so circumstanced as to have it in their power to be extremely beneficial to each other in promoting their mutual prosperity <\s>

<s> it would really be a great pleasure to them to be instrumental in cementing a union between the two republics of holland and the united states by a treaty of amity and commerce similar to that lately concluded with france or varying where circumstances might require it <\s>

<s> sir i have had the honor to receive your note of the 5th instant informing me of the wish of the commissioners of the united states of north america to engage your good offices with the king that the necessary measures may be taken to fulfil his majesty's engagements under the 8th article of the treaty of february 6th of the present year in reference to the barbary powers <\s>
<s> i have examined the article and find that the king promised to employ his mediation with the emperor of morocco and the other barbary powers in order to provide as fully as possible for the interest and security of the citizens of the united states and the protection of their vessels and effects against all violence insult attacks or depredations by the said barbary powers or their subjects <\s>
<s> from the nature of this engagement it appears to me proper to use all means to comply with it notwithstanding any difficulties which seem to lie in the way but before presenting any plan to his majesty it seems to me necessary to inform him of the actual dispositions of the united states and of the measures they may deem desirable on the part of france <\s>
<s> do the united states wish to conclude treaties with the barbary powers or do they wish merely that our influence should be exerted to make their flag respected by those powers <\s>
<s> in the latter case we should never succeed or if we should obtain liberty of commerce for the united states from some of them it would be an illusory temporary and precarious permission and would infallibly expose us without being of the least benefit to the citizens of the united states <\s>
<s> the algerines in particular would never acknowledge the flag of the united states unless it were made for their interests to do so <\s>
<s> you know too well sir the character of the barbary states and their policy to be ignorant of the inefficacy and dangers of such a measure <\s>
<s> it would probably be less difficult to induce them to acknowledge the independence of the united states and to conclude treaties with this new power <\s>
<s> it is necessary to know beforehand what are the instructions of the commissioners and whether they are authorised to negotiate with the barbary powers under the mediation of france <\s>
<s> if congress has this intention then i could receive the orders of the king to give the commissioners the information necessary for entering upon a negotiation with the barbary powers and we should be able to concert effectual measures for succeeding in this object without exposing our own interests for those of the united states <\s>
<s> this negotiation will be long and arduous but i will neglect nothing to assure its success if the congress determine to prosecute it and you consider the king pledged to forward it <\s>
