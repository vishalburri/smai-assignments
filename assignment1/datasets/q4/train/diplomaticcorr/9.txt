<s> gerard in the month of january last at versailles he observed that the thirteenth article 15 in the treaty proposed by congress which exempted the molasses purchased by the inhabitants of the united states in any of the islands belonging to and subject to his most christian majesty from any duties whatever was an unequal article as he termed it that without some concession of equal importance on the part of the united states it could not be agreed to as it would carry the appearance of inequality and as if congress were taking the advantage and dictating the terms in their own favor that therefore it was expected either wholly to omit the article or place an equivalent over against it on our part <\s>
<s> on my return to paris i laid m <\s>
<s> gerard's proposals before my colleagues who agreed generally to the justice and propriety of them but we found it difficult to place any article or articles over against that of molasses which would be of equal consequence and in which the states of america were at the same time equally interested <\s>
<s> after long consideration had on the subject dr franklin proposed the article nearly as it now stands mr lee objected to it as being too extensive and more than equivalent for that of molasses only to which i answered that though the concession might appear great it was in reality nothing more than giving up what we never could make use of but to our own prejudice for nothing was more evident than the bad policy of laying duties on our own exports that molasses though apparently but an article of small value was the basis on which a very great part of the american commerce rested that the manufacture of it into rum was every year increasing especially in the middle and southern states where it had been more lately introduced <\s>
<s> doctor franklin agreed with me and argued on much the same ground but neither of us insisted on the article at the time but that the proposition should be made for the consideration of mons <\s>
<s> gerard reserving to ourselves the power of agreeing to it or not afterwards <\s>
<s> a few evenings after and nearly as i can remember about five or six days before the actual signing of the treaty we met mons <\s>
<s> gerard at my house in paris he brought the proposed treaty with him in which he had inserted the 11th and 12th articles as they now stand <\s>
<s> the treaty was read considered and agreed to article by article except the 11th and 12th respecting which m <\s>
<s> gerard observed at first that he considered them as they then stood reciprocal and equal but that he left it entirely with us to retain them both or to reject them both it being indifferent with his majesty but that one could not be retained without the other <\s>
<s> on our having agreed to all the other articles we told him we would confer together on the 11th and 12th and write to him what our determination should be <\s>
<s> as soon as he was gone the subject was taken up the arguments before used were again considered and finally we unanimously agreed to retain both the articles on which i desired mr lee to write a letter to mons <\s>
<s> gerard informing him of it and that i would send it out to versailles the next morning from passy that there might be no more delay in transcribing and executing the treaties <\s>
<s> mr lee accordingly wrote and dr franklin he and myself signed the letter which i sent the next morning 16 a day or two after this mr a <\s>

<s> gerard by him that we were content to have the two articles left out if agreeable to his majesty 17 as we had just before unanimously agreed and written to have them retained we could not with any consistency make a point of their being expunged <\s>

<s> gerard in the month of january last at versailles he observed that the thirteenth article 15 in the treaty proposed by congress which exempted the molasses purchased by the inhabitants of the united states in any of the islands belonging to and subject to his most christian majesty from any duties whatever was an unequal article as he termed it that without some concession of equal importance on the part of the united states it could not be agreed to as it would carry the appearance of inequality and as if congress were taking the advantage and dictating the terms in their own favor that therefore it was expected either wholly to omit the article or place an equivalent over against it on our part <\s>
<s> on my return to paris i laid m <\s>
<s> gerard's proposals before my colleagues who agreed generally to the justice and propriety of them but we found it difficult to place any article or articles over against that of molasses which would be of equal consequence and in which the states of america were at the same time equally interested <\s>
<s> after long consideration had on the subject dr franklin proposed the article nearly as it now stands mr lee objected to it as being too extensive and more than equivalent for that of molasses only to which i answered that though the concession might appear great it was in reality nothing more than giving up what we never could make use of but to our own prejudice for nothing was more evident than the bad policy of laying duties on our own exports that molasses though apparently but an article of small value was the basis on which a very great part of the american commerce rested that the manufacture of it into rum was every year increasing especially in the middle and southern states where it had been more lately introduced <\s>
<s> doctor franklin agreed with me and argued on much the same ground but neither of us insisted on the article at the time but that the proposition should be made for the consideration of mons <\s>
<s> gerard reserving to ourselves the power of agreeing to it or not afterwards <\s>
<s> a few evenings after and nearly as i can remember about five or six days before the actual signing of the treaty we met mons <\s>
<s> gerard at my house in paris he brought the proposed treaty with him in which he had inserted the 11th and 12th articles as they now stand <\s>
<s> the treaty was read considered and agreed to article by article except the 11th and 12th respecting which m <\s>
<s> gerard observed at first that he considered them as they then stood reciprocal and equal but that he left it entirely with us to retain them both or to reject them both it being indifferent with his majesty but that one could not be retained without the other <\s>
<s> on our having agreed to all the other articles we told him we would confer together on the 11th and 12th and write to him what our determination should be <\s>
<s> as soon as he was gone the subject was taken up the arguments before used were again considered and finally we unanimously agreed to retain both the articles on which i desired mr lee to write a letter to mons <\s>
<s> gerard informing him of it and that i would send it out to versailles the next morning from passy that there might be no more delay in transcribing and executing the treaties <\s>
<s> mr lee accordingly wrote and dr franklin he and myself signed the letter which i sent the next morning 16 a day or two after this mr a <\s>
<s> lee wrote a letter to dr franklin and me in which he expressed great uneasiness about the 11th and 12th articles and a desire to have them left out on which we advised mr lee to go himself to versailles on the subject which he accordingly did and we wrote to m <\s>
<s> gerard by him that we were content to have the two articles left out if agreeable to his majesty 17 as we had just before unanimously agreed and written to have them retained we could not with any consistency make a point of their being expunged <\s>
<s> mr lee discoursed on the subject with m <\s>
<s> gerald who satisfied him as he thought at the time and as we all then thought of the impropriety of making any alteration in the treaty after it had been so maturely considered had been fully agreed upon by us all had been approved of in form by his majesty and ordered to be transcribed and signed <\s>
<s> neither mr william lee nor mr izard ever spoke one word to me on the subject and i did not think myself authorised or at liberty to consult them or any other person on the subject but my colleagues <\s>
<s> footnotes 15 article xiii <\s>
<s> i know not that it was ever done <\s>
<s> i have only to add on this subject that all the monies received by mr hodge amounted to 92,729 livres 18 3 in the whole and that mr hodge rendered us other services besides equipping these two vessels <\s>
<s> speaking of the contracts he says they were in fact concealed from me with the utmost care as was every other means of my knowing how these affairs were conducted <\s>
<s> i have in reply to relate the following facts which are easy to be ascertained <\s>
<s> mr lee on his return from berlin was made acquainted with the contracts messrs _holker_ now in boston _sabbatier and desprez repeatedly conferred with mr lee on the subject in my presence and when they brought in their accounts mr lee assisted in adjusting them and signed with us the orders for the payment as mr grand's account and the orders and accounts themselves will show <\s>
<s> it is true the execution of m <\s>
<s> monthieu's contract was not completed when i left paris and therefore his accounts could not be settled <\s>
<s> mr williams had the oversight of repairing the arms in the magazine at nantes he settled his accounts with his workmen monthly he had a frigate fitting out for the commissioners 10,000 suits of clothes making up a number of shirts shoes c <\s>
<s> together with the charge of all the stores the commissioners were sending to nantes to be shipped <\s>
<s> monthly accounts were not to be expected in reason from a man in such a situation it could not be done if promised and mr williams is a gentleman of too much probity as well as knowledge in business to promise what he cannot perform <\s>
<s> it is not enough to say that no man in france enjoys a better character for strict honor and probity both at court and in the city than mons <\s>
<s> justice must add there is no man enjoys it perhaps so universally through the kingdom among the merchants the farmers or husbandmen and mechanics in all which branches of business he is constantly speculating <\s>
<s> this man is the friend of dr franklin i have the pleasure of knowing him to be mine and what is more the friend of my country on all and in the most trying occasions <\s>
<s> i do not wonder that mr lee should appear jealous of this gentleman as well as of every body else a select few excepted and very few indeed are those who escape his jealous suspicions either in europe or america <\s>
<s> it is a melancholy truth but justice to the public requires my declaring it that i never knew mr lee from his first coming to paris satisfied with any one person he did business with whether of a public or private nature and his dealings whether for trifles or for things of importance almost constantly ended in a dispute sometimes in litigious quarrels <\s>
<s> mr lee lived some time in m <\s>
<s> chaumont knew him perfectly well and was not reserved in speaking his opinion of him <\s>
<s> i am sorry to be thus long on so disagreeable a subject a subject which i cautiously waived entering on in my narration to congress not choosing to trouble them with matters which they might deem of a personal nature <\s>
<s> i am grieved to have been forced on it at all and hope never to be obliged to resume it and as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debt or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and the honorable mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit the accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever sum may be found due from the commissioners may by them be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means the truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> having forgot to mention it in its place i must be permitted to add here that the first vessel purchased and fitted out by mr hodge was on the return and imprisonment of cunningham detained by order from court and a second purchased in which cunningham went on his second cruise <\s>

<s> _mr deane's observations on mr arthur lee's letter of june 1st 1778 mr lee in his letter of the 1st of june on which i have made observations having insinuated many things to the disadvantage of doctor franklin's character as well as to that of mons <\s>
<s> chaumont and my own and mr izard in those letters the extracts from which i was favored with by order of congress having gone even beyond mr lee and since in his letter of the 28th of june last speaking of doctor franklin and myself he says there is very little reason to think that any objections however well founded would have made any impression on the interested views of one or the haughtiness and self-sufficiency of the other <\s>
<s> afterwards in the same letter speaking of doctor franklin he says his abilities are great and his reputation high removed as he is to so considerable a distance from the observation of his constituents if he is not guided by principles of virtue and honor those abilities and that reputation may produce the most mischievous effects <\s>
<s> in my conscience i declare to you that i believe him under no such internal restraints and god knows that i speak the real unprejudiced sentiments of my heart <\s>
<s> gratitude as well as justice to that truly great man to whose friendship and counsel i owe much oblige me to say on this occasion that i not only believe but know that this is to say no more of it directly the reverse of the character which dr franklin has ever sustained and which he now most eminently supports <\s>
<s> it gives me pleasure to reflect on the honors and respect universally paid him by all orders of people in france and never did i enjoy greater satisfaction than in being the spectator of the public honors often paid him <\s>
<s> a celebrated cause being to be heard before the parliament of paris and the house and streets leading to it crowded with people on the appearance of doctor franklin way was made for him in the most respectful manner and he passed through the crowd to the seat reserved for him amid the acclamations of the people an honor seldom paid to their first princes of the blood <\s>
<s> when he attended the operas and plays similar honors were paid him and i confess i felt a joy and pride which were pure and honest though not disinterested for i considered it an honor to be known to be an american and his friend <\s>
<s> what were the sensations of the writers of these letters on such occasions i leave their letters and conduct towards him to speak and i cannot now express the indignation and grief i feel at finding such a character represented as the worst that human depravity is capable of exhibiting and that such a representation should be made by an american in a public character <\s>
<s> in the course of my narrative i mentioned mr williams's accounts as being finally settled <\s>
<s> i drew my conclusion from his letter to me of the 22d of july last read in congress <\s>
<s> i find the accounts are not finally closed though doctor franklin and mr adams have ordered him the payment <\s>
<s> mr williams informs me he has written to congress and sent his accounts the accounts themselves will show that i have not nor ever had any private or personal interest in his transactions at the same time i beg leave to interest myself in what affects this gentleman because i think i know him to have been a most faithful and useful servant of the public and every way deserving of the character given him by dr franklin and mr adams and as dr franklin from being his uncle feels a delicacy in writing so fully about him i therefore pray that this gentleman's accounts may be put into a train for being closed <\s>
<s> i recollect that mr lee has mentioned count lauragais in his correspondence with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais and am informed that this gentleman has in his letters been referred to <\s>
<s> count lauragais is a nobleman who was born to an immense fortune the chief of which he has long since dissipated in a wild and i may say in such an eccentric course of life as hardly has a parallel in france <\s>
<s> he has set up at times for a philosopher a wit a poet then as suddenly flew off and engaged in building planting or politics he was one month for engaging in trade the next a country gentleman on his farm the third blazing in the beau monde at paris and france being insufficient to afford a variety of scenes suited to equal the restlessness of his genius he has constantly been shifting them from paris to london and from london to paris <\s>
<s> in london he set up for a patriot and engaged seriously in the disputes and parties of the day and what was very diverting sat down for a few weeks to study the laws of england in order to confute blackstone <\s>
<s> his rank to which his birth entitles him gives him admittance to court and the extravagancy of his wit and humor serves to divert and please men in high office and he consequently at times fancies himself in their secrets <\s>
<s> this gentleman knew mr lee in london before i arrived in france and was afterwards often with him at paris <\s>
<s> his character was given me soon after my arrival and i was put on my guard and warned by the minister not that he supposed him to have designs unfriendly either to france or america but on account of his imprudence and of his being frequently in london and with those in the opposition in england of whom the court of france were more jealous and against whom they were equally on their guard as with the british ministry themselves <\s>
<s> as this nobleman's name may be made use of i cannot dispense with touching lightly on the outlines of a character extremely well known in france and england and to which some gentlemen in america are no strangers <\s>
<s> i have mentioned the first and principal contract having been made for clothing with mr holker now agent for france in america <\s>
<s> this gentleman was then one of the inspectors general of the manufactures of france and knowing perfectly well the price and quality of cloth in every part of the kingdom he undertook at the request of our mutual friend mons <\s>
<s> chaumont to put us in the way of being supplied at the cheapest rates and by joining himself in the written contract induced his friends messrs sabbatier and desprez to engage which they did they purchased the cloth at the manufactories at the first cost procured it to be made up at the cheapest rate and the clothes to be transported to nantes charging only the prime cost on every thing and two per cent commissions for their trouble <\s>
<s> mr holker after having engaged these men whose house is a capital one in paris and who from their having for some time supplied a great part of the clothes to the armies of france were well acquainted with business of that kind took no farther part in the affair but that of examining the work and accounts to see that every thing was performed in the best and cheapest manner <\s>
<s> in this i assisted him <\s>
<s> i went with him to the workmen and examined the cloth the fashion and the economy practised in the work from which i will venture to assert that clothes of equal goodness could not be made cheaper if so cheap by any other method in france <\s>
<s> mr holker and the other gentlemen as i have already observed saw mr arthur lee several times on the subject until they became so disgusted with a man who found fault with every thing without stepping out of his door to examine any thing that they declined having any thing further to say to him <\s>
<s> when their accounts were ready to be settled i examined them struck the balance and mr arthur lee joined with dr franklin and myself in signing draughts on mr grand for the money <\s>
<s> the bills were drawn in favor of messrs sabbatier and desprez solely mr holker taking no share in the commissions but generously gave in the time he had spent in the affair though it had been considerable <\s>
<s> this gentleman is now in philadelphia and if necessary may be applied to respecting what i have said on this subject his character as well as that of his worthy father is well known in france where they are jointly inspectors of the manufactures of that kingdom and on every occasion they exerted themselves to serve this country a testimony due to them from me when i am called on to mention them publicly <\s>
<s> the instances they gave me personally of the most disinterested friendship and attachment i shall never forget <\s>
<s> i can but return to mr williams <\s>
<s> this gentleman after stating all his accounts in the fairest and most explicit order attended near ten weeks at passy for a settlement <\s>
<s> doctor franklin and mr adams as has before been related so far approved of them as to order his balance or nearly the whole of it to be paid him and gave him a letter certifying him of their full persuasion of his ability and integrity and that he had done good services yet such was the disposition of mr lee towards him that he could by no means get them past <\s>
<s> impatient and wearied out with the captious insulting manner in which he was treated by mr lee and which nothing but his official character protected him in mr williams engaged a gentleman from boston mr cutler to copy off all his accounts and compare them with the original vouchers and to make a voyage to america to lay them before congress <\s>
<s> this gentleman arrived a few days since and having made the voyage and journey on this purpose only i take the liberty to entreat congress in behalf of my absent friend and their faithful servant that those accounts may be examined that mr cutler may be heard if necessary to explain them and mr williams relieved from the embarrassments of mr lee whose disposition does not appear to be mended since i left paris but if possible greatly increased for dispute and for the most vexatious altercation <\s>
<s> could i take any pleasure on so disagreeable a subject and one which throws the affairs as well as reputation of these states into confusion and disgrace it would be to find that the universal testimony of all who know the situation of our affairs in france confirms what i have in duty and justice to these states been obliged to lay before congress <\s>
<s> mr lee's nephew a son of the honorable richard henry lee is in the house of mons <\s>
<s> schweighauser at nantes as a clerk or as a partner i am informed the latter <\s>
<s> commercial affairs and the disposition of prizes are put into the care of this house while a near connexion of m <\s>
<s> schweighauser at guernsey or jersey is employing himself in sending out cruisers on our commerce <\s>
<s> i know nothing of m <\s>
<s> schweighauser except by reports those have been in his favor as a good merchant but this circumstance added to some others which mr cutler informs me of has given cause for the greatest uneasiness and distrust which added to the difficulties met with at paris from mr arthur lee prevents any thing being done to effect if really any thing at all towards sending out supplies to these states <\s>

<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> in a conference had with mons <\s>
<s> gerard in the month of january last at versailles he observed that the thirteenth article 15 in the treaty proposed by congress which exempted the molasses purchased by the inhabitants of the united states in any of the islands belonging to and subject to his most christian majesty from any duties whatever was an unequal article as he termed it that without some concession of equal importance on the part of the united states it could not be agreed to as it would carry the appearance of inequality and as if congress were taking the advantage and dictating the terms in their own favor that therefore it was expected either wholly to omit the article or place an equivalent over against it on our part <\s>
<s> on my return to paris i laid m <\s>
<s> gerard's proposals before my colleagues who agreed generally to the justice and propriety of them but we found it difficult to place any article or articles over against that of molasses which would be of equal consequence and in which the states of america were at the same time equally interested <\s>
<s> after long consideration had on the subject dr franklin proposed the article nearly as it now stands mr lee objected to it as being too extensive and more than equivalent for that of molasses only to which i answered that though the concession might appear great it was in reality nothing more than giving up what we never could make use of but to our own prejudice for nothing was more evident than the bad policy of laying duties on our own exports that molasses though apparently but an article of small value was the basis on which a very great part of the american commerce rested that the manufacture of it into rum was every year increasing especially in the middle and southern states where it had been more lately introduced <\s>
<s> doctor franklin agreed with me and argued on much the same ground but neither of us insisted on the article at the time but that the proposition should be made for the consideration of mons <\s>
<s> gerard reserving to ourselves the power of agreeing to it or not afterwards <\s>
<s> a few evenings after and nearly as i can remember about five or six days before the actual signing of the treaty we met mons <\s>
<s> gerard at my house in paris he brought the proposed treaty with him in which he had inserted the 11th and 12th articles as they now stand <\s>
<s> the treaty was read considered and agreed to article by article except the 11th and 12th respecting which m <\s>
<s> gerard observed at first that he considered them as they then stood reciprocal and equal but that he left it entirely with us to retain them both or to reject them both it being indifferent with his majesty but that one could not be retained without the other <\s>
<s> on our having agreed to all the other articles we told him we would confer together on the 11th and 12th and write to him what our determination should be <\s>
<s> as soon as he was gone the subject was taken up the arguments before used were again considered and finally we unanimously agreed to retain both the articles on which i desired mr lee to write a letter to mons <\s>
<s> gerard informing him of it and that i would send it out to versailles the next morning from passy that there might be no more delay in transcribing and executing the treaties <\s>
<s> mr lee accordingly wrote and dr franklin he and myself signed the letter which i sent the next morning 16 a day or two after this mr a <\s>

<s> gerard by him that we were content to have the two articles left out if agreeable to his majesty 17 as we had just before unanimously agreed and written to have them retained we could not with any consistency make a point of their being expunged <\s>

<s> gerald who satisfied him as he thought at the time and as we all then thought of the impropriety of making any alteration in the treaty after it had been so maturely considered had been fully agreed upon by us all had been approved of in form by his majesty and ordered to be transcribed and signed <\s>
<s> neither mr william lee nor mr izard ever spoke one word to me on the subject and i did not think myself authorised or at liberty to consult them or any other person on the subject but my colleagues <\s>

<s> i know not that it was ever done <\s>
<s> i have only to add on this subject that all the monies received by mr hodge amounted to 92,729 livres 18 3 in the whole and that mr hodge rendered us other services besides equipping these two vessels <\s>
<s> speaking of the contracts he says they were in fact concealed from me with the utmost care as was every other means of my knowing how these affairs were conducted <\s>
<s> i have in reply to relate the following facts which are easy to be ascertained <\s>
<s> mr lee on his return from berlin was made acquainted with the contracts messrs _holker_ now in boston _sabbatier and desprez repeatedly conferred with mr lee on the subject in my presence and when they brought in their accounts mr lee assisted in adjusting them and signed with us the orders for the payment as mr grand's account and the orders and accounts themselves will show <\s>
<s> it is true the execution of m <\s>
<s> monthieu's contract was not completed when i left paris and therefore his accounts could not be settled <\s>
<s> mr williams had the oversight of repairing the arms in the magazine at nantes he settled his accounts with his workmen monthly he had a frigate fitting out for the commissioners 10,000 suits of clothes making up a number of shirts shoes c <\s>
<s> together with the charge of all the stores the commissioners were sending to nantes to be shipped <\s>
<s> monthly accounts were not to be expected in reason from a man in such a situation it could not be done if promised and mr williams is a gentleman of too much probity as well as knowledge in business to promise what he cannot perform <\s>
<s> it is not enough to say that no man in france enjoys a better character for strict honor and probity both at court and in the city than mons <\s>
<s> justice must add there is no man enjoys it perhaps so universally through the kingdom among the merchants the farmers or husbandmen and mechanics in all which branches of business he is constantly speculating <\s>
<s> this man is the friend of dr franklin i have the pleasure of knowing him to be mine and what is more the friend of my country on all and in the most trying occasions <\s>
<s> i do not wonder that mr lee should appear jealous of this gentleman as well as of every body else a select few excepted and very few indeed are those who escape his jealous suspicions either in europe or america <\s>
<s> it is a melancholy truth but justice to the public requires my declaring it that i never knew mr lee from his first coming to paris satisfied with any one person he did business with whether of a public or private nature and his dealings whether for trifles or for things of importance almost constantly ended in a dispute sometimes in litigious quarrels <\s>
<s> mr lee lived some time in m <\s>
<s> chaumont knew him perfectly well and was not reserved in speaking his opinion of him <\s>
<s> i am sorry to be thus long on so disagreeable a subject a subject which i cautiously waived entering on in my narration to congress not choosing to trouble them with matters which they might deem of a personal nature <\s>
<s> i am grieved to have been forced on it at all and hope never to be obliged to resume it and as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debt or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and the honorable mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit the accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever sum may be found due from the commissioners may by them be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means the truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> having forgot to mention it in its place i must be permitted to add here that the first vessel purchased and fitted out by mr hodge was on the return and imprisonment of cunningham detained by order from court and a second purchased in which cunningham went on his second cruise <\s>
<s> the first was put up for sale at dunkirk but not disposed of when i left paris at least i had not heard of it <\s>

<s> there will be found the sum of 4351 livres 5s <\s>
<s> paid by messrs horneca fitzeau co <\s>
<s> dumas and for other expenses <\s>
<s> i fear on a review that the brevity i aimed at may cause some mistake it is therefore proper to observe that but a part of this sum was paid to mons <\s>

<s> _mr deane's observations on mr arthur lee's letter of june 1st 1778 mr lee in his letter of the 1st of june on which i have made observations having insinuated many things to the disadvantage of doctor franklin's character as well as to that of mons <\s>
<s> chaumont and my own and mr izard in those letters the extracts from which i was favored with by order of congress having gone even beyond mr lee and since in his letter of the 28th of june last speaking of doctor franklin and myself he says there is very little reason to think that any objections however well founded would have made any impression on the interested views of one or the haughtiness and self-sufficiency of the other <\s>
<s> afterwards in the same letter speaking of doctor franklin he says his abilities are great and his reputation high removed as he is to so considerable a distance from the observation of his constituents if he is not guided by principles of virtue and honor those abilities and that reputation may produce the most mischievous effects <\s>
<s> in my conscience i declare to you that i believe him under no such internal restraints and god knows that i speak the real unprejudiced sentiments of my heart <\s>
<s> gratitude as well as justice to that truly great man to whose friendship and counsel i owe much oblige me to say on this occasion that i not only believe but know that this is to say no more of it directly the reverse of the character which dr franklin has ever sustained and which he now most eminently supports <\s>
<s> it gives me pleasure to reflect on the honors and respect universally paid him by all orders of people in france and never did i enjoy greater satisfaction than in being the spectator of the public honors often paid him <\s>
<s> a celebrated cause being to be heard before the parliament of paris and the house and streets leading to it crowded with people on the appearance of doctor franklin way was made for him in the most respectful manner and he passed through the crowd to the seat reserved for him amid the acclamations of the people an honor seldom paid to their first princes of the blood <\s>
<s> when he attended the operas and plays similar honors were paid him and i confess i felt a joy and pride which were pure and honest though not disinterested for i considered it an honor to be known to be an american and his friend <\s>
<s> what were the sensations of the writers of these letters on such occasions i leave their letters and conduct towards him to speak and i cannot now express the indignation and grief i feel at finding such a character represented as the worst that human depravity is capable of exhibiting and that such a representation should be made by an american in a public character <\s>
<s> in the course of my narrative i mentioned mr williams's accounts as being finally settled <\s>
<s> i drew my conclusion from his letter to me of the 22d of july last read in congress <\s>
<s> i find the accounts are not finally closed though doctor franklin and mr adams have ordered him the payment <\s>
<s> mr williams informs me he has written to congress and sent his accounts the accounts themselves will show that i have not nor ever had any private or personal interest in his transactions at the same time i beg leave to interest myself in what affects this gentleman because i think i know him to have been a most faithful and useful servant of the public and every way deserving of the character given him by dr franklin and mr adams and as dr franklin from being his uncle feels a delicacy in writing so fully about him i therefore pray that this gentleman's accounts may be put into a train for being closed <\s>
<s> i recollect that mr lee has mentioned count lauragais in his correspondence with mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais and am informed that this gentleman has in his letters been referred to <\s>
<s> count lauragais is a nobleman who was born to an immense fortune the chief of which he has long since dissipated in a wild and i may say in such an eccentric course of life as hardly has a parallel in france <\s>
<s> he has set up at times for a philosopher a wit a poet then as suddenly flew off and engaged in building planting or politics he was one month for engaging in trade the next a country gentleman on his farm the third blazing in the beau monde at paris and france being insufficient to afford a variety of scenes suited to equal the restlessness of his genius he has constantly been shifting them from paris to london and from london to paris <\s>
<s> in london he set up for a patriot and engaged seriously in the disputes and parties of the day and what was very diverting sat down for a few weeks to study the laws of england in order to confute blackstone <\s>
<s> his rank to which his birth entitles him gives him admittance to court and the extravagancy of his wit and humor serves to divert and please men in high office and he consequently at times fancies himself in their secrets <\s>
<s> this gentleman knew mr lee in london before i arrived in france and was afterwards often with him at paris <\s>
<s> his character was given me soon after my arrival and i was put on my guard and warned by the minister not that he supposed him to have designs unfriendly either to france or america but on account of his imprudence and of his being frequently in london and with those in the opposition in england of whom the court of france were more jealous and against whom they were equally on their guard as with the british ministry themselves <\s>
<s> as this nobleman's name may be made use of i cannot dispense with touching lightly on the outlines of a character extremely well known in france and england and to which some gentlemen in america are no strangers <\s>
