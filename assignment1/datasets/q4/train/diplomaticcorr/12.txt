<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>

<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>

<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>

<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>

<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>

<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>

<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>

<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>

<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>

<s> sir i have written repeatedly to congress and to mr morris and enclosed my accounts as i have not been honored with any answer i fear either that my letters may have been intercepted or that the multiplicity of business has prevented <\s>
<s> mr barclay has been here some days he has looked into my accounts with the public and i have given him a copy of them which he has promised me to send by the most safe conveyance and does me the favor of enclosing this to you which is simply to request that you would take or procure to be taken such measures as will bring on a final and decisive settlement of my accounts <\s>
<s> mr barclay tells me that he has no orders on the subject and that it lies in your department <\s>
<s> i have therefore taken the liberty to address myself to you <\s>
<s> mr barclay after viewing my accounts proposed that auditors or arbitrators should be named at paris to audit and settle the accounts <\s>
<s> i have not the least objection to this nor shall i have any against any person or persons named by congress provided they are such as have a competent knowledge of accounts and are impartial <\s>
<s> i am willing either to nominate one part of them or to leave the whole nomination to dr franklin as congress shall prefer or to submit my accounts to the examination of mr barclay alone provided that he be empowered to take the opinion of disinterested persons on the spot as to any dubious or uncertain articles and to make a final close of the affair <\s>
<s> you will by exerting your interest to bring this affair to a settlement do as i conceive material service to the public and certainly lay the utmost obligations on one who has the honor to be with great respect and esteem c 23 silas deane <\s>
<s> footnotes 23 in addition to articles in the newspapers mr deane wrote a pamphlet vindicating himself from the charges that were brought against him chiefly by mr arthur lee in two publications and in his letters to congress <\s>

<s> on the 22d of october arthur lee was elected in the place of mr jefferson who declined accepting the appointment <\s>
<s> these three commissioners met in paris about the middle of december where they continued to reside chiefly employed in procuring military supplies and money for the united states till they signed the treaty of alliance february 6th 1778 <\s>

<s> gentlemen after expressing our hopes that this will find you all three safely fixed at paris we proceed with pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of mr deane's letter of the 1st of october <\s>
<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> paris 15th may 1781 <\s>
<s> sir on my arriving in france i applied to mr johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers which i told him would soon be ready <\s>
<s> he informed me that he had determined not to accept the appointment and that he had informed congress of his resolution sometime before <\s>
<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>
<s> my present situation as well as the state of my accounts give the lie to every assertion or insinuation of the kind yet i am still left to suffer under the calumny in america and to be obliged to strangers for money for my support in europe <\s>
<s> i will not trust myself further on the subject lest something escape me which may offend without my intending it <\s>
<s> i hope congress will impartially review my case in every stage of it and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation or to the tribunal of the public in europe for the recovery of my right and for justice to my character which the great and first law of nature will oblige me to do unless immediately relieved by those who owe me and more who owe to their own character and to that of their country the justice which i demand <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>

<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>

<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>

<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> mr barclay tells me that he has no orders on the subject and that it lies in your department <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> sir on my arriving in france i applied to mr johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers which i told him would soon be ready <\s>
<s> he informed me that he had determined not to accept the appointment and that he had informed congress of his resolution sometime before <\s>
<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>
<s> my present situation as well as the state of my accounts give the lie to every assertion or insinuation of the kind yet i am still left to suffer under the calumny in america and to be obliged to strangers for money for my support in europe <\s>
<s> i will not trust myself further on the subject lest something escape me which may offend without my intending it <\s>
<s> i hope congress will impartially review my case in every stage of it and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation or to the tribunal of the public in europe for the recovery of my right and for justice to my character which the great and first law of nature will oblige me to do unless immediately relieved by those who owe me and more who owe to their own character and to that of their country the justice which i demand <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>

<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>

<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>

<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> mr barclay tells me that he has no orders on the subject and that it lies in your department <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> sir on my arriving in france i applied to mr johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers which i told him would soon be ready <\s>
<s> he informed me that he had determined not to accept the appointment and that he had informed congress of his resolution sometime before <\s>
<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>
<s> my present situation as well as the state of my accounts give the lie to every assertion or insinuation of the kind yet i am still left to suffer under the calumny in america and to be obliged to strangers for money for my support in europe <\s>
<s> i will not trust myself further on the subject lest something escape me which may offend without my intending it <\s>
<s> i hope congress will impartially review my case in every stage of it and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation or to the tribunal of the public in europe for the recovery of my right and for justice to my character which the great and first law of nature will oblige me to do unless immediately relieved by those who owe me and more who owe to their own character and to that of their country the justice which i demand <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>

<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>

<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>

<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> mr barclay tells me that he has no orders on the subject and that it lies in your department <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> sir on my arriving in france i applied to mr johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers which i told him would soon be ready <\s>
<s> he informed me that he had determined not to accept the appointment and that he had informed congress of his resolution sometime before <\s>
<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>
<s> my present situation as well as the state of my accounts give the lie to every assertion or insinuation of the kind yet i am still left to suffer under the calumny in america and to be obliged to strangers for money for my support in europe <\s>
<s> i will not trust myself further on the subject lest something escape me which may offend without my intending it <\s>
<s> i hope congress will impartially review my case in every stage of it and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation or to the tribunal of the public in europe for the recovery of my right and for justice to my character which the great and first law of nature will oblige me to do unless immediately relieved by those who owe me and more who owe to their own character and to that of their country the justice which i demand <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>

<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>

<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>

<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> mr barclay tells me that he has no orders on the subject and that it lies in your department <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> sir on my arriving in france i applied to mr johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers which i told him would soon be ready <\s>
<s> he informed me that he had determined not to accept the appointment and that he had informed congress of his resolution sometime before <\s>
<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>
<s> my present situation as well as the state of my accounts give the lie to every assertion or insinuation of the kind yet i am still left to suffer under the calumny in america and to be obliged to strangers for money for my support in europe <\s>
<s> i will not trust myself further on the subject lest something escape me which may offend without my intending it <\s>
<s> i hope congress will impartially review my case in every stage of it and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation or to the tribunal of the public in europe for the recovery of my right and for justice to my character which the great and first law of nature will oblige me to do unless immediately relieved by those who owe me and more who owe to their own character and to that of their country the justice which i demand <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>

<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>

<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>

<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>

<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>

<s> mr barclay tells me that he has no orders on the subject and that it lies in your department <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> sir on my arriving in france i applied to mr johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers which i told him would soon be ready <\s>
<s> he informed me that he had determined not to accept the appointment and that he had informed congress of his resolution sometime before <\s>
<s> though this was a severe disappointment to me yet i flattered myself that congress would not delay the naming some other to the office and in this hope i came to paris in august last and entered on the adjustment of my accounts which have been for many months ready for settlement yet to my extreme mortification i cannot get them closed for want of an auditor or person empowered by congress to examine them <\s>
<s> i pray congress would candidly review the circumstances i have been under from my leaving france in april 1778 to this time <\s>
<s> after having to that time faithfully and successfully served them i was in obedience to their orders obliged to make a voyage to america and to wait their pleasure in philadelphia for more than a year unable to obtain their decision on my conduct though it was almost daily solicited by me the only objection made was that my accounts remained unsettled as soon as congress appointed an auditor to examine them i set out on my voyage to europe regardless of danger or expense fondly hoping that at last i should be able to close my accounts and to receive the balance due to me but what was infinitely more important to vindicate my injured character <\s>
<s> the expenses of my voyage were great and during ten months attendance here they have been still greater and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor i have been refused money for my support <\s>
<s> i have never asked of congress anything but common justice in the payment of my just demands out of which i have now been kept for three years <\s>
<s> my necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the amount of the money due to me but i have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my country and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support <\s>
<s> and to what purpose is it for me to leave france and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited <\s>
<s> it is equally useless to transmit them in that state <\s>
<s> my enemies represented me as a defaulter grown rich out of the public monies in my hands and prejudiced the minds of congress so strongly against me that all my efforts in america to obtain even a hearing were vain and ineffectual <\s>
<s> my present situation as well as the state of my accounts give the lie to every assertion or insinuation of the kind yet i am still left to suffer under the calumny in america and to be obliged to strangers for money for my support in europe <\s>
<s> i will not trust myself further on the subject lest something escape me which may offend without my intending it <\s>
<s> i hope congress will impartially review my case in every stage of it and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation or to the tribunal of the public in europe for the recovery of my right and for justice to my character which the great and first law of nature will oblige me to do unless immediately relieved by those who owe me and more who owe to their own character and to that of their country the justice which i demand <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>

<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>

<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>

<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>

<s> gentlemen after expressing our hopes that this will find you all three safely fixed at paris we proceed with pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of mr deane's letter of the 1st of october <\s>
<s> when we reflect on the character and views of the court of london it ceases to be a wonder that the british ambassador and all other british agents should employ every means that tended to prevent european powers and france more especially from giving america aid in this war <\s>
<s> prospects of accommodation it is well known would effectually prevent foreign interference and therefore without one serious design of accommodating on any principles but the absolute submission of america the delusive idea of conciliation has been industriously suggested on both sides of the water that under cover of this dividing and aid-withholding prospect the vast british force sent to america might have the fairest chance of succeeding and this policy has in fact done considerable injury to the united states as we shall presently show by a just detail of this campaign for it is not yet ended <\s>
<s> you know gentlemen that at the moment a potent land and marine force was preparing to be sent hither an act was passed for appointing commissioners who too many expected were to give peace to america <\s>
<s> as therefore the war might be soon concluded so were our military arrangements accommodated and the troops taken into service the last spring consisting of regular corps and bodies of militia were all engaged for short periods <\s>
<s> with these the campaign began in various parts of north america <\s>
<s> dr franklin is so well acquainted with the progress of the war in canada previous to his departure that we need only observe the campaign has ended as favorably for us in that quarter as we could reasonably expect <\s>
<s> the enemy having been able to pierce no further than crown point after a short stay and reconnoitering general gates army at ticonderoga thought proper to recross the lake and leave us in quiet possession of those passes <\s>
<s> general gates having left a proper force at ticonderoga and on the communication retired with the rest of his troops <\s>
<s> new york and its neighborhood not being defensible by an army singly against a strong land and sea force acting in conjunction was of necessity yielded to the enemy after some contest general washington retiring until the situation of the country above kingsbridge no longer enabled the enemy to receive aid from their ships <\s>
<s> general howe having stopped here and general carleton at crown point effectually disappointed the great object of joining the two armies <\s>
<s> the latter as we have said returning to canada and the former retreating from the white plains towards new york gave us a favorable prospect of seeing a happy end put to this dangerous campaign however many causes have concurred in producing an unlucky reverse of fortune such as the nature of the country the uncommon fineness of the weather even to this day and above all the short enlistments which gave the soldiery an opportunity of going home tired as they were with the operations of an active summer <\s>
<s> when general howe retreated from the white plains he halted his whole army on the north river between dobbs ferry and kingsbridge where he remained for some time <\s>
<s> having effected so little of the great business that brought him here and the season allowing him time for it most men were of opinion that the next attempt would be to get possession of philadelphia by a forced march through the jerseys whilst a fleet should be sent up the delaware to facilitate the enterprise <\s>
<s> to guard against such a manoeuvre general washington crossed the north river with all the battalions that had been raised to the westward of it leaving general lee with the eastern troops to guard the pass of the highlands on hudson river <\s>
<s> in this situation of things general howe made a sudden attack upon fort washington with the greatest part of his army and carried it with considerable loss making nearly three thousand of our men prisoners <\s>
<s> by this event it became unnecessary longer to hold fort lee or fort constitution as it was formerly called which is on the west side of the north river nearly opposite fort washington <\s>
<s> it had therefore been determined to abandon fort lee but before the stores could be all removed the enemy came suddenly upon it and the garrison retreated leaving some of their baggage and stores behind <\s>
<s> about this time general howe became possessed of a letter by the agency of some wicked person who contrived to get it from the express written by general washington to the board of war in which he had given an exact account when the time of service of all our battalions would expire and his apprehensions that the men would not re-enlist without first going home to see their families and friends <\s>
<s> possessed of this intelligence the opportunity was carefully watched and a vigorous impression actually made at the very crisis when our army in the jerseys was reduced to 3000 men by the retiring of numbers and the sickness of others and before militia could in this extensive country be brought up to supply their places the enemy marched rapidly on through the jerseys whilst our feeble army was obliged to retreat from post to post until it crossed the delaware at trenton where about 2500 militia from the city of philadelphia joined the general <\s>
<s> since general howe's arrival on the borders of the delaware various manoeuvres and stratagems have been practised to effect a passage over the river but they have hitherto failed <\s>
<s> general washington's small army is placed along the west side of the delaware to within fourteen miles of philadelphia from above coryel's ferry which with the gondolas one frigate of thirtytwo guns and other armed vessels in the river above the cheveaux de frize cover the passage of it <\s>
<s> general lee who had crossed the north river with as many of the eastern troops as could be spared from the defence of the highlands either to join general washington or to act on the enemy's rear as occasions might point out was the other day surprised and made prisoner by a party of seventy light horse who found him in a house a few miles in the rear of his army with his domestics only <\s>
<s> this loss though great will in some degree be repaired for the present by general gates who we understand has joined the army commanded by general lee and who we have reason to think has by this time effected a junction of his force with that of general washington <\s>
<s> as the militia are marching from various quarters to reinforce the general if the enemy do not quickly accomplish their wishes of possessing philadelphia we hope not only to save that city but to see general howe retreat as fast as he advanced through the jerseys <\s>
<s> general clinton with a fleet in which it is said he carried 8000 men has gone from new york through the sound some suppose for rhode island but neither his destination or its consequences are yet certainly known to us <\s>
<s> thus gentlemen we have given you a true detail of the progress and present state of our affairs which although not in so good a posture as they were two months ago are by no means in so bad a way as the emissaries of the british court will undoubtedly represent them <\s>
<s> if the great land and sea force with which we have been attacked be compared with the feeble state in which the commencement of this war found us with respect to military stores of all kinds soldiers clothing navy and regular force and if the infinite art be considered with which great britain has endeavored to prevent our getting these necessaries from foreign parts which has in part prevailed the wonder will rather be that our enemies have made so little progress than that they have made so much <\s>
<s> all views of accommodation with great britain except on principles of peace as independent states and in a manner perfectly consistent with the treaties our commissioners may make with foreign states being totally at an end since the declaration of independence and the embassy to the court of france congress have directed the raising of ninetyfour battalions of infantry with some cavalry thirteen frigates from twentyfour to thirtysix guns are already launched and fitting and two ships of the line with five more frigates are ordered to be put on the stocks <\s>
<s> we hear the levies are going on well in the different states <\s>
<s> until the new army is collected the militia must curb the enemy's progress <\s>
<s> the very considerable force that great britain has already in north america the possibility of recruiting it here within their own quarters by force and fraud together added to the reinforcements that may be sent from europe and the difficulty of finding funds in the present depressed state of american commerce all conspire to prove incontestibly that if france desires to preclude the possibility of north america being ever reunited with great britain now is the favorable moment for establishing the glory strength and commercial greatness of the former kingdom by the ruin of her ancient rival <\s>
<s> a decided part now taken by the court of versailles and a vigorous engagement in the war in union with north america would with ease sacrifice the fleet and army of great britain at this time chiefly collected about new york <\s>
<s> the inevitable consequence would be the quick reduction of the british islands in the west indies already barred of defence by the removal of their troops to this continent <\s>
<s> for reasons here assigned gentlemen you will readily discern how all important it is to the security of american independence that france should enter the war as soon as may be and how necessary it is if it be possible to procure from her the line of battle ships you were desired in your instructions to obtain for us the speedy arrival of which here in the present state of things might decide the contest at one stroke <\s>
<s> we shall pay proper attention to what mr deane writes concerning dr williamson and mr hopkins and we think that the ill treatment this country and mr deane have received from these men strongly suggests the necessity of reserve with persons coming to france as americans and friends to america about whom the most irrefragable proofs have not removed all doubt 25 the british recall of their mediterranean passes is an object of great consequence and may require much intercession with the court of france to prevent the mischiefs that may be derived to american commerce therefrom but this subject has been already touched upon in your instructions on the sixth article of the treaty proposed to be made with france <\s>
<s> as all affairs relative to the conduct of commerce and remittance pass through another department we beg leave to refer you to the secret committee and mr thomas morris their agent in france for every information on those subjects <\s>
<s> the neighborhood of philadelphia having by the enemy's movements become the seat of war it was judged proper that congress should adjourn to this town where the public business may be attended to with the undisturbed deliberation that its importance demands <\s>
<s> the congress was accordingly opened here on the 20th inst <\s>
<s> as it is more than probable that the conference with lord howe on staten island may be misrepresented to the injury of these states we do ourselves the pleasure to enclose you an authenticated account of the whole business which the possibility of dr franklin's not arriving renders proper <\s>
<s> this step was taken to unmask his lordship and evince to the world that he did not possess powers which for the purpose of delusion and division had been suggested <\s>
<s> mr deane's proposition of a loan is accepted by congress and they have desired two millions sterling to be obtained if possible <\s>
<s> the necessity of keeping up the credit of our paper currency and the variety of important uses that may be made of this money have induced congress to go so far as six per cent but the interest is heavy and it is hoped that you may be able to do the business on much easier terms <\s>
<s> the resolves of congress on this subject are enclosed and your earliest attention to them is desired that we may know as soon as possible the event of this application <\s>
<s> another resolve enclosed will show you that congress approve of armed vessels being fitted out by you on continental account provided the court of france dislike not the measure and blank commissions for this purpose will be sent you by the next opportunity <\s>
<s> private ships of war or privateers cannot be admitted where you are because the securities necessary in such cases to prevent irregular practices cannot be given by the owners and commanders of such privateers <\s>
<s> another resolve of congress which we have the honor to enclose you directs the conduct to be pursued with regard to portugal 26 we have nothing further to add at present but to request that you will omit no good opportunity of informing us how you succeed in your mission what events take place in europe by which these states may be effected and that you contrive to send to us in regular succession some of the best london french and dutch newspapers with any valuable political publications that may concern north america <\s>

<s> s the american captures of british vessels at sea have not been less numerous or less valuable than before dr franklin left us <\s>
