<s> it is possible that the united states as these laws are less advantageous to the privateers and more favorable to the original proprietors of recaptured vessels would give the preference to those of france <\s>
<s> in these circumstances the rules of reciprocity observed between the two powers require that arrangements be taken to adopt the law of one of the two nations which shall be observed by the respective privateers and in the meantime i am persuaded that you will think with me that the american privateer general mifflin ought not to exact in france other advantages than what in a similar case a french privateer would meet with in north america <\s>
<s> this discussion moreover should not take place perhaps in the particular affair in question <\s>

<s> sir we have this morning the honor of receiving your excellency's letter of the 16th relative to the french brigantine the isabella retaken by the american privateer the general mifflin from a guernsey privateer after having been eight hours in his hands <\s>
<s> we have the honor to agree perfectly with your excellency in your sentiments of the justice and policy of the principle of reciprocity between the two nations and that this principle requires that french ships of war or privateers should have the same advantage in case of prizes and recaptures that the american privateers enjoy in france <\s>
<s> we are so unfortunate at present as to have no copy of any of the laws of the united states relative to such cases and are not able to recollect with precision the regulations in any of them <\s>
<s> but we are informed by captain m'neil that by the law of massachusetts bay if a vessel is taken within twentyfour hours one third goes to the recaptors after twentyfour hours until seventytwo hours one half after seventytwo hours and before ninetysix hours three quarters and after ninety six hours the whole <\s>
<s> all that we have power to do in this case is to convey to congress a copy of your excellency's letter and of our answer and we have no doubt but congress will readily recommend to the several states to make laws giving to french privateers either the same advantages that their own privateers have in such cases in their own ports or the same advantages that the french privateers enjoy in the ports of this kingdom in such cases by the ordinance of the king <\s>
<s> and we wish your excellency would signify to us which would probably be most agreeable to his majesty <\s>
<s> if the case of this vessel must come before the public tribunal upon the simple question whether she was taken from a pirate or not that tribunal we doubt not will decide with impartiality but we cannot refrain from expressing to your excellency that we think the original owner will be ill advised if he should put himself to this trouble and expense <\s>
<s> we presume not to dispute the wisdom of the ordinance of the king which gives to the recaptor from a pirate only one third because we know not the species of pirates which was then in contemplation nor the motives of that regulation <\s>
<s> but your excellency will permit us to observe that this regulation is so different from the general practice and from the spirit of the laws of nations that there is no doubt it ought to receive a strict interpretation and that it is incumbent on the original proprietor to make it very evident that the first captor was a pirate <\s>
<s> in the case in question the guernsey privateer certainly had a commission from the king of great britain against american vessels at least <\s>
<s> but admitting for argument's sake that he had no commission at all the question arises whether the two nations of france and england are at war or not <\s>
<s> and although there has been no formal declaration of war on either side yet there seems to be little doubt that the two nations have been at actual war at least from the time of the mutual recall of their ambassadors if not from the moment of the british king's most warlike speech to his parliament <\s>
<s> now if it is admitted that the two nations are at war we believe it would be without a precedent in the history of jurisprudence to adjudge the subject of any nation to be guilty of piracy for an act of hostility committed at sea against the subject of another nation at war <\s>
<s> such a principle for what we see would conclude all the admirals and other officers of both nations guilty of the same offence <\s>

<s> in the _general thesis you may see the disposition of the ordinance of the marine of 1681 which adjudges to captains captors of recaptured vessels when they have been during twentyfour hours in the enemy's hands a third for the charges of rescue when they are retaken before the twentyfour hours <\s>
<s> the american privateers shall enjoy in france without difficulty the benefit of this law if it has been adopted by the united states in such a manner as that the french privateers may be assured of experiencing the same treatment with respect to the recaptures they may conduct into the ports of north america <\s>
<s> the english laws on the contrary grant a privateer only one eighth of the value of the vessels retaken within the first twentyfour hours a fifth within the second day a third within the third and fourth and afterwards one half which leaves at least in every case the other half to the losing proprietors <\s>
<s> it is possible that the united states as these laws are less advantageous to the privateers and more favorable to the original proprietors of recaptured vessels would give the preference to those of france <\s>
<s> in these circumstances the rules of reciprocity observed between the two powers require that arrangements be taken to adopt the law of one of the two nations which shall be observed by the respective privateers and in the meantime i am persuaded that you will think with me that the american privateer general mifflin ought not to exact in france other advantages than what in a similar case a french privateer would meet with in north america <\s>
<s> this discussion moreover should not take place perhaps in the particular affair in question <\s>
<s> i am just informed that the french proprietor claims his vessel as retaken from pirates offering to pay a third of its value to the american privateer which delivered it <\s>
<s> this is agreeable to the 10th article under the title of _prizes_ of the ordinance of 1681 which appears justly applicable to this particular case <\s>

<s> you will observe that their accounts are to be fairly settled and what is justly due paid for as on the one hand congress would be unwilling to evidence a disregard for and contemptuous refusal of the spontaneous friendship of his most christian majesty so on the other they are unwilling to put into the private pockets of individuals what was graciously designed for the public benefit <\s>
<s> you will be pleased to have their accounts liquidated and direct in the liquidation thereof that particular care be taken to distinguish the property of the crown of france from the private property of hortalez co <\s>
<s> and transmit to us the accounts so stated and distinguished <\s>
<s> this will also be accompanied by an invoice of articles to be imported from france and resolves of congress relative thereto <\s>
<s> you will appoint if you should judge proper an agent or agents to inspect the quality of such goods as you may apply for to the house of roderique hortalez co <\s>
<s> before they are shipped to prevent any impositions <\s>
<s> on the 16th of may last congress resolved that the invoice of articles to be imported from france together with the list of medicines approved by congress be signed by the committee of commerce and transmitted to the commissioners of the united states at paris who are authorised and directed to apply to the house of roderique hortalez co <\s>
<s> for such of the said articles as they shall have previously purchased or contracted for that copies of the invoices be delivered to mons <\s>
<s> de francy agent for roderique hortalez co together with a copy of the foregoing resolution and that the articles to be shipped by the house of roderique hortalez co <\s>

<s> we have the honor to enclose to your excellency a copy of the contract made between the committee and mons <\s>
<s> francy a copy of mons <\s>
<s> francy's powers and a copy of the list of articles to be furnished according to that contract that your excellency may have before you all the papers relative to this subject <\s>
<s> we are under the necessity of applying to your excellency upon this occasion and of requesting your advice <\s>
<s> with regard to what is passed we know not who the persons are who constitute the house of roderique hortalez co but we have understood and congress has ever understood and so have the people in america in general that they were under obligations to his majesty's good will for the greatest part of the merchandise and warlike stores heretofore furnished under the firm of roderique hortalez co <\s>
<s> we cannot discover that any written contract was ever made between congress or any agent of theirs and the house of roderique hortalez co nor do we know of any living witness or any other evidence whose testimony can ascertain to us who the persons are that constitute the house of roderique hortalez co or what were the terms upon which the merchandise and munitions of war were supplied neither as to the price nor the time or conditions of payment <\s>
<s> as we said before we apprehend that the united states hold themselves under obligations to his majesty for all those supplies and we are sure it is their wish and their determination to discharge the obligation to his majesty as soon as providence shall put it in their power <\s>
<s> in the mean time we are ready to settle and liquidate the accounts according to our instructions at any time and in any manner which his majesty and your excellency shall point out to us <\s>
<s> as the contract for future supplies is to be ratified or not ratified by us as we shall judge expedient we must request your excellency's advice as a favor upon this head and whether it would be safe or prudent in us to ratify it and in congress to depend upon supplies from this quarter <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write to me on the subject of the french ship isabella which the american privateer general mifflin recaptured from a guernsey privateer <\s>
<s> in the _general thesis you may see the disposition of the ordinance of the marine of 1681 which adjudges to captains captors of recaptured vessels when they have been during twentyfour hours in the enemy's hands a third for the charges of rescue when they are retaken before the twentyfour hours <\s>
<s> the american privateers shall enjoy in france without difficulty the benefit of this law if it has been adopted by the united states in such a manner as that the french privateers may be assured of experiencing the same treatment with respect to the recaptures they may conduct into the ports of north america <\s>
<s> the english laws on the contrary grant a privateer only one eighth of the value of the vessels retaken within the first twentyfour hours a fifth within the second day a third within the third and fourth and afterwards one half which leaves at least in every case the other half to the losing proprietors <\s>
<s> it is possible that the united states as these laws are less advantageous to the privateers and more favorable to the original proprietors of recaptured vessels would give the preference to those of france <\s>
<s> in these circumstances the rules of reciprocity observed between the two powers require that arrangements be taken to adopt the law of one of the two nations which shall be observed by the respective privateers and in the meantime i am persuaded that you will think with me that the american privateer general mifflin ought not to exact in france other advantages than what in a similar case a french privateer would meet with in north america <\s>
<s> this discussion moreover should not take place perhaps in the particular affair in question <\s>
<s> i am just informed that the french proprietor claims his vessel as retaken from pirates offering to pay a third of its value to the american privateer which delivered it <\s>
<s> this is agreeable to the 10th article under the title of _prizes_ of the ordinance of 1681 which appears justly applicable to this particular case <\s>
<s> if it should be found that the guernsey privateer falls under the description of those pirates whose depredations have obliged his majesty to order general reprisals and that she has not been furnished with new letters of marque which the court of london did not grant before the month of august to cruise against french vessels as appears from the declaration of the captain of the isabella this question will be necessarily submitted to the decision of the tribunals and i cannot do otherwise than see that the most prompt justice be rendered to the american privateer <\s>
<s> i request at any rate that you will be pleased to give me your opinion on the principal question taking for granted the different laws of the two nations with respect to reprisals or rescues <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>

<s> sir we have this morning the honor of receiving your excellency's letter of the 16th relative to the french brigantine the isabella retaken by the american privateer the general mifflin from a guernsey privateer after having been eight hours in his hands <\s>
<s> we have the honor to agree perfectly with your excellency in your sentiments of the justice and policy of the principle of reciprocity between the two nations and that this principle requires that french ships of war or privateers should have the same advantage in case of prizes and recaptures that the american privateers enjoy in france <\s>
<s> we are so unfortunate at present as to have no copy of any of the laws of the united states relative to such cases and are not able to recollect with precision the regulations in any of them <\s>
<s> but we are informed by captain m'neil that by the law of massachusetts bay if a vessel is taken within twentyfour hours one third goes to the recaptors after twentyfour hours until seventytwo hours one half after seventytwo hours and before ninetysix hours three quarters and after ninety six hours the whole <\s>
<s> all that we have power to do in this case is to convey to congress a copy of your excellency's letter and of our answer and we have no doubt but congress will readily recommend to the several states to make laws giving to french privateers either the same advantages that their own privateers have in such cases in their own ports or the same advantages that the french privateers enjoy in the ports of this kingdom in such cases by the ordinance of the king <\s>
<s> and we wish your excellency would signify to us which would probably be most agreeable to his majesty <\s>
<s> if the case of this vessel must come before the public tribunal upon the simple question whether she was taken from a pirate or not that tribunal we doubt not will decide with impartiality but we cannot refrain from expressing to your excellency that we think the original owner will be ill advised if he should put himself to this trouble and expense <\s>
<s> we presume not to dispute the wisdom of the ordinance of the king which gives to the recaptor from a pirate only one third because we know not the species of pirates which was then in contemplation nor the motives of that regulation <\s>
<s> but your excellency will permit us to observe that this regulation is so different from the general practice and from the spirit of the laws of nations that there is no doubt it ought to receive a strict interpretation and that it is incumbent on the original proprietor to make it very evident that the first captor was a pirate <\s>
<s> in the case in question the guernsey privateer certainly had a commission from the king of great britain against american vessels at least <\s>
<s> but admitting for argument's sake that he had no commission at all the question arises whether the two nations of france and england are at war or not <\s>
<s> and although there has been no formal declaration of war on either side yet there seems to be little doubt that the two nations have been at actual war at least from the time of the mutual recall of their ambassadors if not from the moment of the british king's most warlike speech to his parliament <\s>
<s> now if it is admitted that the two nations are at war we believe it would be without a precedent in the history of jurisprudence to adjudge the subject of any nation to be guilty of piracy for an act of hostility committed at sea against the subject of another nation at war <\s>
<s> such a principle for what we see would conclude all the admirals and other officers of both nations guilty of the same offence <\s>
