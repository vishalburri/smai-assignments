<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>

<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>

<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>

<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>

<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>

<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>

<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>
<s> i will make no apology for troubling them so long at this time my situation is i trust a sufficient one <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>

<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>

<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>

<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> sir i do myself the honor of enclosing a memorial 22 which i beg of you to lay before congress as early as may be and i flatter myself it will be taken under their consideration as soon as is consistent with the other important affairs before them <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 4th september 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i take the liberty of addressing you on the subject of a memorial i presented to congress and to pray you would inform me what the determination of congress has been thereon <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most sincere respect and attachment c <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>
<s> i will make no apology for troubling them so long at this time my situation is i trust a sufficient one <\s>
<s> i have only to add that having delayed to leave the town beyond the time i proposed in my last i hope for an early answer and have the honor to be with the utmost respect and attachment c <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>

<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>

<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>

<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>

<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>

<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>
<s> i will make no apology for troubling them so long at this time my situation is i trust a sufficient one <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>

<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>

<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>

<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> sir i do myself the honor of enclosing a memorial 22 which i beg of you to lay before congress as early as may be and i flatter myself it will be taken under their consideration as soon as is consistent with the other important affairs before them <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 4th september 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i take the liberty of addressing you on the subject of a memorial i presented to congress and to pray you would inform me what the determination of congress has been thereon <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most sincere respect and attachment c <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>
<s> i will make no apology for troubling them so long at this time my situation is i trust a sufficient one <\s>
<s> i have only to add that having delayed to leave the town beyond the time i proposed in my last i hope for an early answer and have the honor to be with the utmost respect and attachment c <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>

<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>

<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>

<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>

<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>

<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>
<s> i will make no apology for troubling them so long at this time my situation is i trust a sufficient one <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>

<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>

<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>

<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>

<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>

<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>

<s> philadelphia 22d may 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as this will probably be the last time i shall trouble congress with my addresses to them i hope to be indulged in briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation <\s>
<s> from the moment that the contest between these states and great britain became serious i have taken and pursued a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune and exposed my life for an object much dearer to me than either the peace liberty and safety of these states <\s>
<s> the part i took in the first and succeeding congress is well known to many of the honorable members now present as well as to my countrymen and fellow citizens in general who must do me the justice to say that i let slip no opportunity either in congress or out which offered for serving america and distressing its enemies <\s>
<s> in january 1776 when i was about returning to my family and private concerns which had suffered much by my absence i was applied to by the committee of congress to go to france to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of america in that kingdom <\s>
<s> the advantages proposed to me in the latter were considerable and without any probability of difficulty embarrassment or risk further than the dangers of the voyage which were indeed great at that time <\s>
<s> in the former it was very different but the difficulties which presented great as they were had no consideration with me in the situation in which our affairs then were <\s>
<s> my subsequent conduct from my arrival in france until i left that kingdom fully demonstrates that private interest and personal safety never had any weight with me when the service of my country called upon me <\s>
<s> in my narrative i have been so particular on the situation i found myself in on my arrival in europe the embarrassments and difficulties i constantly labored under and had to encounter and in the many letters i have written to congress since my return requesting my conduct might be examined in the strictest and most public manner i have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had ever been that i am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present <\s>
<s> on the fourth of march 1778 after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these states which fell almost solely on me and having jointly with my colleagues concluded the treaty of the sixth of february which secured and guarantied the independence of these states when i found myself for the first time after my leaving america free from those distressing embarrassments and difficulties i had been constantly under and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects in view and which i had for some time contemplated for the service of these states i received the resolution of congress of the 8th of december ordering me to return immediately to america to inform congress of the _state of foreign affairs in europe <\s>
<s> i did not hesitate a moment as to the part i should take but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others which then fortunately coincided to the greatest possible advantage of these states the publication of the treaty until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret and the sending out the toulon fleet in which i embarked early in april <\s>
<s> i submit to the consideration of congress whether from the 4th of march to the 30th the day i left paris i could possibly have been better employed and whether i could have justified myself or been even excused by others had i neglected these objects and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of congress for the mere purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the different ports of france accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself <\s>
<s> i say i submit this to the consideration of congress nor do i fear publicly to submit it to the world or even to those enemies whom i am so unfortunate as to have in it <\s>
<s> the voice of my friend and colleague doctor franklin with that of my other noble friends and patrons in france to me was lose not a moment on any object either public or private the fleet at toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there by no means let it wait a moment for you you may sail early in april and be in america in the course of the month of may you may finish the information you have to give congress immediately and return to france by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement <\s>
<s> it cannot be supposed that i wanted to be urged to take the part i did on the contrary i exerted myself to the utmost in my power to get away as early and as secretly as possible being convinced that the plan was well laid happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it and sensible how much depended on despatch <\s>
<s> never was there a more glorious prospect before us than at that time nor ever were my hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion <\s>
<s> having been honored with the particular confidence and i may say friendship of the minister and knowing that the relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival i suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment <\s>
<s> i was not insensible that i had enemies in america i knew well that i had them in france in mr williams and mr arthur lee and i was well acquainted with their connexions in america but conscious of the part i had acted and of the services i had rendered and was then doing for my country which services were not in words but in acts the most honorable testimonials of which given by the highest and first characters in europe or america i had in my hands i had nothing to apprehend <\s>
<s> though permit me to assure you that had i at the time foreseen all that has happened and that even my life as well as reputation were to be sacrificed on my return to the interested views of my enemies i should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part i actually did take at the time <\s>
<s> on my arrival early in july i repaired immediately to congress and informed them i waited their orders <\s>
<s> it was late in august before i had the honor of an audience <\s>
<s> many circumstances as well as direct information convinced me of what i had before suspected that ill offices had been done me and my conduct misrepresented <\s>
<s> when i was first heard before congress i therefore requested that if anything had been alleged against any part of my conduct or character as the public agent and commissioner of congress i might be made acquainted therewith and have an opportunity for an explanation <\s>
<s> i received no answer and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me <\s>
<s> i was told by many of the honorable members that they knew of none nor had they heard of any <\s>
<s> conversing with an honorable friend of mine i mentioned to him my expectation of returning to france early in the fall on which he told me i must not expect it for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way as most probably would detain me here much longer than i thought for <\s>
<s> i asked him how it was possible when the business i was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished and when the unclosed state in which i had been obliged to leave many public transactions in europe made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public as well as to myself and especially when nothing had nor i presumed could be alleged against me <\s>
<s> he answered that it was the design of those who wished to sacrifice me to the family interests and emoluments of my enemies to wear me out by delays and without any direct charges to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations hints and innuendoes that though i might with confidence rely on the justice of congress yet measures would be taken to delay it on one pretence or other in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me <\s>
<s> though i could by no means bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time yet they made me more attentive to what was passing and my observations served to confirm them <\s>
<s> the many fruitless applications i made for near five months to obtain an audience of congress and to have the business i came out upon closed are well known to congress and the inferences i drew from the silent neglects which my requests met with may be easily conceived <\s>
<s> in this situation i determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens to whom i considered myself ultimately accountable though immediately so to their representatives in congress <\s>
<s> in consequence of this determination i published my address in the beginning of december <\s>
<s> on the 5th congress resolved to hear me on the 7th i attended and was ordered to _report in writing my agency of their affairs in europe as soon as may be c in obedience to their commands i delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions from the time of my leaving america and flattered myself that from the time which had elapsed from my recall which was more than twelve months and more than five from the time of my return and attendance the fullest examination must have been made into every part of my conduct and that i could not fail of obtaining an early decision <\s>
<s> confident in the justice of congress i forbore to address the public further whilst my cause was before congress and whilst i daily expected their determination <\s>
<s> from these considerations i silently submitted to the torrent of abuse misrepresentation and calumny which almost daily poured forth against me in the public papers <\s>
<s> i considered myself as the servant of congress and entitled to their protection to them i constantly appealed not for favors i asked none but for justice <\s>
<s> it is now five months since i laid my narrative before congress and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to examine and report on foreign affairs and that my narrative was referred to them i applied repeatedly to several of the honorable members and requested that if in the course of their examination they met with anything in the letters and documents before them respecting my conduct which required explanation they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith <\s>
<s> i was not notified to attend them on the subject and though i am informed their report has been for several weeks before congress i am unacquainted with its contents as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made <\s>
<s> since i had the honor of laying my narrative before congress i have repeatedly solicited for the decision of congress but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to the many letters i have written it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them it would take some time to refer to the dates only they are before congress and to them i appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public or that of an innocent but greatly injured free citizen <\s>
<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> sir i do myself the honor of enclosing a memorial 22 which i beg of you to lay before congress as early as may be and i flatter myself it will be taken under their consideration as soon as is consistent with the other important affairs before them <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 4th september 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i take the liberty of addressing you on the subject of a memorial i presented to congress and to pray you would inform me what the determination of congress has been thereon <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most sincere respect and attachment c <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
<s> i appeal to the honorable gentlemen in congress then present and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and style of living to inform congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the americans who visited them at paris or who escaped from prison in england and applied for relief fell <\s>
<s> i lay this general state before congress to convince them how very far i was from being prodigal of the public monies and that the accounts delivered general as they are are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance <\s>
<s> my future reputation and fortune depend much on my mercantile character in these transactions and i rely on the justice of congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with vilified and abused <\s>
<s> under the load of calumny and abuse i have for some months sustained i have had this consolation that the services i had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her and that they would one day be acknowledged but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line i cannot sit down easy under imputations injurious to my private character <\s>
<s> i have long since requested to have these accounts examined into on the spot where only a full and minute investigation can be made and that they should be settled as justice required <\s>
<s> i now repeat my request and that previous thereto the accounts laid before congress be examined from which alone it will appear if there be any ground even for suspicion and that i may be permitted to obviate if in my power here any objections that may be made <\s>
<s> the mode in which the monies were received for the commissioners use at paris the source from whence they came with other circumstances relative are such that i have not thought it consistent with the interest the policy or even the delicacy of congress or others to lay the case at large before my countrymen though i found myself injured in their opinion by the abuse constantly thrown out against me in the papers and from my silence on the subject <\s>
<s> i have ever been and still remain confident that a general examination of the accounts even in the state they are must prove satisfactory to congress and that a minute investigation will show me to have merited their approbation and not their censure <\s>
<s> my first duty is to satisfy congress in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce and to them therefore i have constantly made my application on this subject <\s>
<s> i will make no apology for troubling them so long at this time my situation is i trust a sufficient one <\s>
<s> i have only to add that having delayed to leave the town beyond the time i proposed in my last i hope for an early answer and have the honor to be with the utmost respect and attachment c <\s>

<s> i have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these states i have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time and i freely rest my merits in that department on facts and on the testimony of those great personages who best know what my conduct was and who have generously and without solicitation from me publicly declared their approbation of it <\s>
<s> with respect to my commercial i have appealed and again appeal to that mode of trial which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether i have embezzled or misapplied the public monies or whether for more than three years faithful services i have received anything more than my private expenses <\s>
<s> i have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts of the commissioners settled on the issue of which i freely put my reputation and every thing dear in life <\s>
<s> my solicitations have been unsuccessful whilst my enemies taking the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving france raise a cry against me and say--where are his accounts <\s>
<s> why did he not bring them out <\s>
<s> if they were not settled why did he not stay and settle them <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect that these very men owe their present political as well as personal safety to the measure i then took i am at a loss which prevails most in my mind indignation or contempt <\s>
<s> i trust congress will indulge me and the rather as i hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon whilst i ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that honorable body coolly to review the scenes i have passed through and to place himself in the different situations i have been in at different periods since my engaging in this great and important contest and consider me after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part after having for more than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country more than three of which have been in the immediate service of congress after having under every disadvantage and embarrassment successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these states after having been the principal actor in concluding an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these states and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as from my friend and colleague and the french nation in general and with an armament which promised on its sailing complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these states and which notwithstanding its misfortunes relieved them this capital in particular from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger after this to be obliged to waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited reproaches into obscurity poverty and exile i ask every member of that honorable body even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me to put themselves for a few moments in my case which i have by no means colored beyond the real life and then pass sentence <\s>
<s> the loss of interest has little weight with me nor loss of time infinitely more precious if by either the honor safety and prosperity of these states is promoted <\s>
<s> in the present case i am deprived even of this consolation having seen to my inexpressible grief the essential interests of these states sacrificed by the very measures which have occasioned the delay of justice to me <\s>
<s> i still glory in the character of a free american citizen and when i fear to speak in the style of one i shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of all titles <\s>
<s> it was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens i have made them in the most decent and urgent manner and repeatedly <\s>
<s> they have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect even whilst every thing dear in life to me and more than life itself my reputation was suffering <\s>
<s> i thank god i have sufficient fortitude to part with every thing in life and life itself in the service of my country without repining but no consideration whatever shall induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified whilst i have the power either to act or speak <\s>
<s> for ten months past i have presented myself and my case before congress such as could by no means be considered in a neutral point of light but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure <\s>
<s> i have not been able to obtain either <\s>
<s> justice therefore to my countrymen and fellow citizens to myself and those great and generous personages who protected and patronized me and the cause i was charged with abroad requires of me that i justify myself before the world by laying before them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first and of the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> in doing this if laid under the necessity i shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency nor be wanting in that respect which i have ever paid and shall ever pay to congress as the representative body of my fellow citizens <\s>
<s> at the same time i shall with proper firmness and the dignity becoming a free but injured citizen expose to public view those whether in congress or out who to promote partial interested and family views have from the first systematically labored to prevent congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant of the public though the interest of these states called for their decision <\s>
<s> i flatter myself i shall not be laid under the necessity of further application but that congress will relieve me from the unmerited distress i labor under by closing this long protracted affair or at least by immediately taking such measures as will without delay do justice to my services <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most respectful esteem and attachment c <\s>

<s> philadelphia 18th august 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i do myself the honor of enclosing a memorial 22 which i beg of you to lay before congress as early as may be and i flatter myself it will be taken under their consideration as soon as is consistent with the other important affairs before them <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> footnotes 22 all the letters written by mr deane from the 10th of july to the 18th of december 1779 were on file in the secretary's office of congress and taken thence for the purpose of having them recorded with his other letters of a prior and subsequent date which were filed in the office of foreign affairs except the memorial mentioned to be enclosed in his letter of the 18th of august 1779 which was then and is still missing <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 4th september 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i take the liberty of addressing you on the subject of a memorial i presented to congress and to pray you would inform me what the determination of congress has been thereon <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most sincere respect and attachment c <\s>

<s> philadelphia 23d november 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of august last i conclude none will be given and consequently that i am laid under the necessity of returning to europe in the best manner i can and at my own expense <\s>
<s> i must confess that when i reflect on the part i have acted and the returns made me for my services i have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to my country with zeal and integrity and of having been successful in the important affairs i engaged in to support me <\s>
<s> previous to my embarking permit me to assure congress that my respect for them as the representative body of these states is not lessened nor my zeal for the service prosperity and happiness of my country abated by the treatment i have met with <\s>
<s> the expense of time and money which i have suffered by my detention in this city with the further expense i am now unavoidably forced to make fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune but as i go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune my honor and character as the faithful servant of these states and confident that in doing this i shall render essential services to my country i cheerfully submit <\s>
<s> on the 26th of august last i received an order on the continental treasurer signed by joseph nourse for ten thousand five hundred dollars said to be _in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on congress from the 4th of june 1778 until the 6th day of august last <\s>
<s> i mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body nor do i feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them who opposed the grant even of that sum to me but the same feelings which prompt me to further sacrifices forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses and confident that the day is not far distant in which i shall demonstrate not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained principally by my agency but that the disposition of them so far as depended on me was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity <\s>
<s> i refer to that time the discussion of what recompense is due me for fourteen months attendance in philadelphia in obedience to the orders of congress and for the other services i have been so fortunate as to render the united states <\s>
