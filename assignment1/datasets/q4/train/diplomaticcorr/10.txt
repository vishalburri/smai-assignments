<s> sir i did myself the honor of writing to your excellency the 22d of february last in which i mentioned the distressed situation into which my affairs were brought by my being detained in this city and in which i earnestly requested to know of congress whether they had any further commands for me and in what manner my past transactions as their agent and commissioner were to be adjusted and closed <\s>
<s> you were pleased to inform me verbally that my letter was referred to the committee who were ordered to report immediately <\s>

<s> when the orders of congress and the service of these states required my immediate return i took with me one hundred and eighty louis d'ors or guineas only to defray my expenses and those of four americans and a servant to america <\s>

<s> the loss of my private property is of no consideration with me if my country is in any way essentially served thereby but whilst congress defer coming to any resolution respecting my private services as their agent and commissioner what is dearer to me than life or fortune my character is attacked and liable to suffer from the groundless and base insinuations of some and from the open calumnies of others <\s>
<s> i cannot but think it an act of justice due not only to me as an individual but to congress and the public in general that my conduct be either approved of or censured i have most surely merited one or the other from the important part i have acted and the manner in which i have transacted it <\s>
<s> i had the honor of bringing with me testimonials not only from my late venerable colleague but from his most christian majesty and his ministers in favor of my conduct whilst in france they have been long since laid before congress and i cannot but conceive that if i have merited the calumnies which have for some months past been publicly thrown out against me and industriously spread through these states justice to those great personages who condescended to interest themselves so warmly in my favor requires that my demerits should be publicly known and made to appear that they may no longer be deceived or in a state of uncertainty respecting my real character and merits <\s>

<s> you were pleased to inform me verbally that my letter was referred to the committee who were ordered to report immediately <\s>
<s> i have since been informed that they have reported but that the report has not been considered by congress nor any resolutions passed thereon <\s>

<s> the settlement of the commissioners accounts and my own will show to demonstration that i have received nothing therefor except money for my necessary expenses <\s>
<s> when the orders of congress and the service of these states required my immediate return i took with me one hundred and eighty louis d'ors or guineas only to defray my expenses and those of four americans and a servant to america <\s>

<s> the loss of my private property is of no consideration with me if my country is in any way essentially served thereby but whilst congress defer coming to any resolution respecting my private services as their agent and commissioner what is dearer to me than life or fortune my character is attacked and liable to suffer from the groundless and base insinuations of some and from the open calumnies of others <\s>

<s> i had the honor of bringing with me testimonials not only from my late venerable colleague but from his most christian majesty and his ministers in favor of my conduct whilst in france they have been long since laid before congress and i cannot but conceive that if i have merited the calumnies which have for some months past been publicly thrown out against me and industriously spread through these states justice to those great personages who condescended to interest themselves so warmly in my favor requires that my demerits should be publicly known and made to appear that they may no longer be deceived or in a state of uncertainty respecting my real character and merits <\s>

<s> i beg leave to remind congress that early in january 1776 i had the honor of being engaged by their committee to go as their agent to france to transact important business for them in the commercial as well as political departments and that i have ever since been in their service in which i flatter myself i have been of some utility to them and to my country but that an absence of almost four years from my family and private affairs more than seven months of which i have waited to know their pleasure respecting me here has so exceedingly embarrassed and distressed me that i hope i shall not be deemed guilty of an unbecoming impatience in pressing to know if congress have any further commands for me and in what manner my past transactions as their agent and commissioner are to be adjusted and closed <\s>

<s> having received no answer to the requests i then made i have now only to add that my situation which for eight months past has been peculiarly distressing is now become such as to oblige me to leave this city without further delay and therefore i again most respectfully entreat of congress to inform me if they expect further information from me respecting their foreign or other affairs and as i shall without loss of time return to europe that i may be informed if they have any further commands for my service and in what manner my past transactions as their agent and commissioner are to be adjusted and closed <\s>

<s> sir i did myself the honor of writing to your excellency the 22d of february last in which i mentioned the distressed situation into which my affairs were brought by my being detained in this city and in which i earnestly requested to know of congress whether they had any further commands for me and in what manner my past transactions as their agent and commissioner were to be adjusted and closed <\s>
<s> you were pleased to inform me verbally that my letter was referred to the committee who were ordered to report immediately <\s>
<s> i have since been informed that they have reported but that the report has not been considered by congress nor any resolutions passed thereon <\s>
<s> this forces me again to apply to congress and to lay before that honorable body in part my situation <\s>
<s> i have been near four years absent from my family and private affairs which have suffered exceedingly thereby more than three years of the time i have been in the actual service of congress <\s>
<s> the settlement of the commissioners accounts and my own will show to demonstration that i have received nothing therefor except money for my necessary expenses <\s>
<s> when the orders of congress and the service of these states required my immediate return i took with me one hundred and eighty louis d'ors or guineas only to defray my expenses and those of four americans and a servant to america <\s>
<s> two of the americans were captains in the navy of the united states and had escaped from prison in england of the other two one had been taken in a private ship of war which he commanded and had also escaped from prison the other was a captain in the merchant service <\s>

<s> i took those american captains with me by the advice and at the desire of the ministers of france and of dr franklin these captains being well acquainted with the american coast <\s>
<s> i have been for more than eight months past in this city and at an expense to which my private fortune is by no means adequate though i have regulated my expenses by the strictest economy my situation could admit of <\s>
<s> i will not trouble congress with mentioning what has past since my return <\s>
<s> the loss of my private property is of no consideration with me if my country is in any way essentially served thereby but whilst congress defer coming to any resolution respecting my private services as their agent and commissioner what is dearer to me than life or fortune my character is attacked and liable to suffer from the groundless and base insinuations of some and from the open calumnies of others <\s>
<s> i cannot but think it an act of justice due not only to me as an individual but to congress and the public in general that my conduct be either approved of or censured i have most surely merited one or the other from the important part i have acted and the manner in which i have transacted it <\s>
<s> i had the honor of bringing with me testimonials not only from my late venerable colleague but from his most christian majesty and his ministers in favor of my conduct whilst in france they have been long since laid before congress and i cannot but conceive that if i have merited the calumnies which have for some months past been publicly thrown out against me and industriously spread through these states justice to those great personages who condescended to interest themselves so warmly in my favor requires that my demerits should be publicly known and made to appear that they may no longer be deceived or in a state of uncertainty respecting my real character and merits <\s>
