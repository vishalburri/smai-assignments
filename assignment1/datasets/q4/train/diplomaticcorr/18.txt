<s> it is with pleasure we read your assurance of sending the soldiers clothing and other materials for the army in time to meet the approaching cold season they will be greatly wanted <\s>
<s> as the small successes the enemy have met with this year will probably support the hopes of a vindictive court and occasion the straining of every nerve for the accomplishment of its tyrannic views we doubt not your most strenuous exertions to prevent great britain from obtaining russian or german auxiliaries for the next campaign and we think with you that it is an object of the greatest importance to cultivate and secure the friendship of his prussian majesty as well for the preventing this evil as for obtaining his public recognition of our independence and leave of his ports for the purposes of commerce and disposal of prizes <\s>
<s> the original papers which you mention in a triplicate to have sent never came to hand so that we can only make conjectures as to the disposition of that monarch <\s>
<s> the marine force of the enemy is so considerable in these seas and so over proportionate to our infant navy that it seems quite necessary and wise to send our ships to distress the commerce of our enemies in other parts of the world <\s>
<s> for this purpose the marine committee have already ordered some vessels to france under your direction as to their future operations and more we expect will be sent <\s>
<s> but our frigates are not capable of carrying much bulky commodity for commercial purposes without unfitting them for war besides there is the consideration of our being obliged to get them away how and when we can or endanger their being taken which prevents our sending them to those staple colonies where the commodities wanted are to be obtained <\s>
<s> the reciprocal benefits of commerce cannot flow from or to north america until some maritime power in europe will aid our cause with marine strength <\s>
<s> and this circumstance gives us pain lest it should be construed as unwillingness on our part to pay our debts when the truth is that we have the greatest desire of doing so have materials in abundance but not the means of conveying them <\s>
<s> this leads us to reflect on the great advantages which must unavoidably accrue to all parties if france or spain were to afford effectual aid on the sea by the loan or sale of ships of war according to the former propositions of congress or if the farmers-general could be prevailed upon to receive in america the tobacco or other products of this northern continent which france may want <\s>

<s> yorktown 6th october 1777 <\s>
<s> gentlemen we shall follow your example in confining this letter entirely to yours of may 26th respecting the loan and the mode of raising it by appropriation of vacant land <\s>
<s> it remains doubtful yet whether there is any vacant land not included within the charter limits of some one of the thirteen states and it is an undetermined question of great magnitude whether such land is to be considered as common stock or the exclusive property of the state within whose charter-bounds it may be found <\s>
<s> until this business has been determined in congress and approved by the states you will readily discover the difficulty of doing anything in the way of raising money by appropriation of vacant land <\s>
<s> we consider your proposal on this subject as of very great importance and we shall not fail to solicit the attention of congress thereto whenever the pressing business of the campaign will permit <\s>
<s> in the mean time we see no reason that should prevent the young nobleman of irish extract from coming to america because the suspension of the question concerning vacant lands will not obstruct his views of getting the quantity he may want either by original entry or by purchase on the most reasonable terms upon the frontiers of those states where vacant lands are in abundance to be met with <\s>
<s> we are warranted to say that such rank as that nobleman may have when he leaves service in europe will be granted to him here <\s>
<s> congress clearly discern with you gentlemen the all important concern of supporting the credit of the continental money and with this view have proposed as you will see by the enclosed resolves to pay the interest of twenty millions of dollars by bills drawn on you <\s>
<s> this we hope will in time replenish the loan offices so effectually as with the aid of taxation now generally taking place to prevent the necessity of future emissions <\s>
<s> by your letters of the 25th of may we have no doubt but these interest bills will be paid with all due punctuality <\s>
