<s> dubourg was so far from sounding the views of his superior in this manoeuvre that he was with the best intentions in the world in danger of counteracting his own wishes the extent of which were to obtain the supplies of merchants and manufacturers on the credit of the colonies in which the strictest punctuality and most scrupulous exactness would be necessary and which under the present difficulties of remittance i feared would not be lived up to <\s>
<s> as i had learned that in the late reform of the french army they had shifted their arms for those of a lighter kind the heavy ones most of which were the same as new to the amount of seventy or eighty thousands lay useless in magazines with other military stores in some such proportion i apprehended it no way impossible to come at a supply from hence through the agency of some merchant without the ministry being concerned in the matter <\s>
<s> in such case the merchant would be accountable to the ministry and the colonies to the merchant by which means a greater time of payment might be given and more allowance in case of our being disappointed <\s>
<s> with this in view i went to versailles on wednesday the 17th and waited on m <\s>
<s> gerard first secretary of foreign affairs and presented to him the enclosed memorial 2 which led to a very particular conversation on the affairs of america and which i turned finally on this subject to which he would not then give me any immediate answer but promised me one in a day or two <\s>
<s> returning to town i found messrs dubourg and beaumarchais had a misunderstanding the latter giving out that he could effect every thing we wished for and the former from the known circumstances of m <\s>

<s> we went as desired and after explaining many things to m <\s>
<s> gerard had a conference with his excellency from whom i had fresh assurances of the utmost freedom and protection in their ports and on their coasts that in one word i might rely on whatever mons <\s>
<s> beaumarchais should engage in the commercial way of supplies which indeed was all i wished for as i was on the safe side of the question viz <\s>

<s> i then informed him that i considered the present as a most critical juncture of american affairs that the campaign would undoubtedly be carried far into the winter that supplies now shipped might arrive very seasonably in the fall to enable the colonies to hold out the present campaign <\s>
<s> he replied that no delay should be made by any obstruction of any officer or others of the customs or police <\s>
<s> he then told me that the count laureguais was perhaps a well meaning man but not sufficiently discreet for such purposes as this that mr lee meaning mr arthur lee of london had confided he feared too much in him and wished me to caution him on the subject and that if i would write to him he would enclose it in a letter of his by a courier that evening <\s>
