<s> and galloping by the prince's side the colonel explained to the prince of wales what his movements had been who the friends were that knew of the expedition whom as esmond conceived the prince should trust entreating him above all to maintain the very closest secrecy until the time should come when his royal highness should appear <\s>
<s> the town swarmed with friends of the prince's cause there were scores of correspondents with st <\s>
<s> germains jacobites known and secret great in station and humble about the court and the queen in the parliament church and among the merchants in the city <\s>
<s> the prince had friends numberless in the army in the privy council and the officers of state <\s>
<s> the great object as it seemed to the small band of persons who had concerted that bold stroke who had brought the queen's brother into his native country was that his visit should remain unknown till the proper time came when his presence should surprise friends and enemies alike and the latter should be found so unprepared and disunited that they should not find time to attack him <\s>
<s> we feared more from his friends than from his enemies <\s>
<s> the lies and tittle tattle sent over to st <\s>
<s> germains by the jacobite agents about london had done an incalculable mischief to his cause and wofully misguided him and it was from these especially that the persons engaged in the present venture were anxious to defend the chief actor in it the managers were the bishop who cannot be hurt by having his name mentioned a very active and loyal nonconformist divine a lady in the highest favor at court with whom beatrix esmond had communication and two noblemen of the greatest rank and a member of the house of commons who was implicated in more transactions than one in behalf of the stuart family <\s>
<s> the party reached london by nightfall leaving their horses at the posting house over against westminster and being ferried over the water where lady esmond's coach was already in waiting <\s>
<s> in another hour we were all landed at kensington and the mistress of the house had that satisfaction which her heart had yearned after for many years once more to embrace her son who on his side with all his waywardness ever retained a most tender affection for his parent <\s>
<s> she did not refrain from this expression of her feeling though the domestics were by and my lord castlewood's attendant stood in the hall <\s>
<s> esmond had to whisper to him in french to take his hat off <\s>
<s> monsieur baptiste was constantly neglecting his part with an inconceivable levity more than once on the ride to london little observations of the stranger light remarks and words betokening the greatest ignorance of the country the prince came to govern had hurt the susceptibility of the two gentlemen forming his escort nor could either help owning in his secret mind that they would have had his behavior otherwise and that the laughter and the lightness not to say license which characterized his talk scarce befitted such a great prince and such a solemn occasion <\s>
<s> not but that he could act at proper times with spirit and dignity <\s>
<s> he had behaved as we all knew in a very courageous manner on the field <\s>
<s> esmond had seen a copy of the letter the prince had writ with his own hand when urged by his friends in england to abjure his religion and admired that manly and magnanimous reply by which he refused to yield to the temptation <\s>
<s> monsieur baptiste took off his hat blushing at the hint colonel esmond ventured to give him and said tenez elle est jolie la petite mere <\s>
<s> elle est charmante mais l'autre qui est cette nymphe cet astre qui brille cette diane qui descend sur nous <\s>
<s> and he started back and pushed forward as beatrix was descending the stair <\s>
<s> she was in colors for the first time at her own house she wore the diamonds esmond gave her it had been agreed between them that she should wear these brilliants on the day when the king should enter the house and a queen she looked radiant in charms and magnificent and imperial in beauty <\s>
<s> castlewood himself was startled by that beauty and splendor he stepped back and gazed at his sister as though he had not been aware before nor was he very likely how perfectly lovely she was and i thought blushed as he embraced her <\s>
<s> the prince could not keep his eyes off her he quite forgot his menial part though he had been schooled to it and a little light portmanteau prepared expressly that he should carry it <\s>
<s> he pressed forward before my lord viscount <\s>
<s> twas lucky the servants eyes were busy in other directions or they must have seen that this was no servant or at least a very insolent and rude one <\s>
<s> again colonel esmond was obliged to cry out baptiste in a loud imperious voice have a care to the valise at which hint the wilful young man ground his teeth together with something very like a curse between them and then gave a brief look of anything but pleasure to his mentor <\s>
<s> being reminded however he shouldered the little portmanteau and carried it up the stair esmond preceding him and a servant with lighted tapers <\s>
<s> he flung down his burden sulkily in the bedchamber a prince that will wear a crown must wear a mask says mr <\s>
<s> i see how it is says monsieur baptiste continuing the talk in french <\s>
<s> the great serious is seriously alarmed for monsieur baptiste broke in the colonel <\s>
<s> esmond neither liked the tone with which the prince spoke of the ladies nor the eyes with which he regarded them <\s>
<s> the bedchamber and the two rooms adjoining it the closet and the apartment which was to be called my lord's parlor were already lighted and awaiting their occupier and the collation laid for my lord's supper <\s>
<s> lord castlewood and his mother and sister came up the stair a minute afterwards and so soon as the domestics had quitted the apartment castlewood and esmond uncovered and the two ladies went down on their knees before the prince who graciously gave a hand to each <\s>
<s> he looked his part of prince much more naturally than that of servant which he had just been trying and raised them both with a great deal of nobility as well as kindness in his air <\s>
<s> madam says he my mother will thank your ladyship for your hospitality to her son for you madam turning to beatrix i cannot bear to see so much beauty in such a posture <\s>
<s> you will betray monsieur baptiste if you kneel to him sure tis his place rather to kneel to you <\s>
<s> a light shone out of her eyes a gleam bright enough to kindle passion in any breast <\s>
<s> there were times when this creature was so handsome that she seemed as it were like venus revealing herself a goddess in a flash of brightness <\s>
<s> she appeared so now radiant and with eyes bright with a wonderful lustre <\s>
<s> a pang as of rage and jealousy shot through esmond's heart as he caught the look she gave the prince and he clenched his hand involuntarily and looked across to castlewood whose eyes answered his alarm signal and were also on the alert <\s>
<s> the prince gave his subjects an audience of a few minutes and then the two ladies and colonel esmond quitted the chamber <\s>
<s> lady castlewood pressed his hand as they descended the stair and the three went down to the lower rooms where they waited awhile till the travellers above should be refreshed and ready for their meal <\s>
<s> esmond looked at beatrix blazing with her jewels on her beautiful neck <\s>
<s> i have kept my word says he and i mine says beatrix looking down on the diamonds <\s>
<s> were i the mogul emperor says the colonel you should have all that were dug out of golconda <\s>
<s> these are a great deal too good for me says beatrix dropping her head on her beautiful breast so are you all all <\s>
<s> and when she looked up again as she did in a moment and after a sigh her eyes as they gazed at her cousin wore that melancholy and inscrutable look which twas always impossible to sound <\s>
<s> when the time came for the supper of which we were advertised by a knocking overhead colonel esmond and the two ladies went to the upper apartment where the prince already was and by his side the young viscount of exactly the same age shape and with features not dissimilar though frank's were the handsomer of the two <\s>
<s> the prince sat down and bade the ladies sit <\s>
<s> the gentlemen remained standing there was indeed but one more cover laid at the table which of you will take it <\s>
<s> the head of our house says lady castlewood taking her son's hand and looking towards colonel esmond with a bow and a great tremor of the voice the marquis of esmond will have the honor of serving the king <\s>
<s> i shall have the honor of waiting on his royal highness says colonel esmond filling a cup of wine and as the fashion of that day was he presented it to the king on his knee <\s>
<s> i drink to my hostess and her family says the prince with no very well pleased air but the cloud passed immediately off his face and he talked to the ladies in a lively rattling strain quite undisturbed by poor mr <\s>
<s> esmond's yellow countenance that i dare say looked very glum <\s>
<s> when the time came to take leave esmond marched homewards to his lodgings and met mr <\s>
<s> addison on the road that night walking to a cottage he had at fulham the moon shining on his handsome serene face what cheer brother <\s>
<s> says addison laughing i thought it was a footpad advancing in the dark and behold tis an old friend <\s>
<s> we may shake hands colonel in the dark tis better than fighting by daylight <\s>
<s> why should we quarrel because i am a whig and thou art a tory <\s>
<s> turn thy steps and walk with me to fulham where there is a nightingale still singing in the garden and a cool bottle in a cave i know of you shall drink to the pretender if you like and i will drink my liquor my own way i have had enough of good liquor no never <\s>
<s> there is no such word as enough as a stopper for good wine <\s>
<s> thou wilt not come <\s>
<s> come any day come soon <\s>
<s> you know i remember simois and the sigeia tellus and the praelia mixta mero mixta mero he repeated with ever so slight a touch of merum in his voice and walked back a little way on the road with esmond bidding the other remember he was always his friend and indebted to him for his aid in the campaign poem <\s>
<s> and very likely mr <\s>
<s> under secretary would have stepped in and taken t'other bottle at the colonel's lodging had the latter invited him but esmond's mood was none of the gayest and he bade his friend an inhospitable good night at the door <\s>
<s> i have done the deed thought he sleepless and looking out into the night he is here and i have brought him he and beatrix are sleeping under the same roof now <\s>
<s> whom did i mean to serve in bringing him <\s>
<s> was it the prince <\s>
