<s> on whit sunday the famous 23rd of may 1706 my young lord first came under the fire of the enemy whom we found posted in order of battle their lines extending three miles or more over the high ground behind the little gheet river and having on his left the little village of anderkirk or autre eglise and on his right ramillies which has given its name to one of the most brilliant and disastrous days of battle that history ever hath recorded <\s>
<s> our duke here once more met his old enemy of blenheim the bavarian elector and the marechal villeroy over whom the prince of savoy had gained the famous victory of chiari <\s>
<s> what englishman or frenchman doth not know the issue of that day <\s>

<s> i think it was more from conviction than policy though that policy was surely the most prudent in the world that the great duke always spoke of his victories with an extraordinary modesty and as if it was not so much his own admirable genius and courage which achieved these amazing successes but as if he was a special and fatal instrument in the hands of providence that willed irresistibly the enemy's overthrow <\s>
<s> before his actions he always had the church service read solemnly and professed an undoubting belief that our queen's arms were blessed and our victory sure <\s>
<s> all the letters which he writ after his battles show awe rather than exultation and he attributes the glory of these achievements about which i have heard mere petty officers and men bragging with a pardonable vainglory in nowise to his own bravery or skill but to the superintending protection of heaven which he ever seemed to think was our especial ally <\s>
<s> and our army got to believe so and the enemy learnt to think so too for we never entered into a battle without a perfect confidence that it was to end in a victory nor did the french after the issue of blenheim and that astonishing triumph of ramillies ever meet us without feeling that the game was lost before it was begun to be played and that our general's fortune was irresistible <\s>
