<s> come up to supper doctor says my lord at which the doctor made another low bow and the party moved on towards a grand house that was before them with many gray towers and vanes on them and windows flaming in the sunshine and a great army of rooks wheeling over their heads made for the woods behind the house as harry saw and mr <\s>
<s> holt told him that they lived at castlewood too <\s>
<s> they came to the house and passed under an arch into a court yard with a fountain in the centre where many men came and held my lord's stirrup as he descended and paid great respect to mr <\s>
<s> and the child thought that the servants looked at him curiously and smiled to one another and he recalled what blaise had said to him when they were in london and harry had spoken about his godpapa when the frenchman said parbleu one sees well that my lord is your godfather words whereof the poor lad did not know the meaning then though he apprehended the truth in a very short time afterwards and learned it and thought of it with no small feeling of shame <\s>
<s> taking harry by the hand as soon as they were both descended from their horses mr <\s>
<s> holt led him across the court and under a low door to rooms on a level with the ground one of which father holt said was to be the boy's chamber the other on the other side of the passage being the father's own and as soon as the little man's face was washed and the father's own dress arranged harry's guide took him once more to the door by which my lord had entered the hall and up a stair and through an ante room to my lady's drawing room an apartment than which harry thought he had never seen anything more grand no not in the tower of london which he had just visited <\s>
<s> indeed the chamber was richly ornamented in the manner of queen elizabeth's time with great stained windows at either end and hangings of tapestry which the sun shining through the colored glass painted of a thousand lines and here in state by the fire sat a lady to whom the priest took up harry who was indeed amazed by her appearance <\s>
<s> my lady viscountess's face was daubed with white and red up to the eyes to which the paint gave an unearthly glare she had a tower of lace on her head under which was a bush of black curls borrowed curls so that no wonder little harry esmond was scared when he was first presented to her the kind priest acting as master of the ceremonies at that solemn introduction and he stared at her with eyes almost as great as her own as he had stared at the player woman who acted the wicked tragedy queen when the players came down to ealing fair <\s>
<s> she sat in a great chair by the fire corner in her lap was a spaniel dog that barked furiously on a little table by her was her ladyship's snuff box and her sugar plum box <\s>
<s> she wore a dress of black velvet and a petticoat of flame colored brocade <\s>
<s> she had as many rings on her fingers as the old woman of banbury cross and pretty small feet which she was fond of showing with great gold clocks to her stockings and white pantofles with red heels and an odor of musk was shook out of her garments whenever she moved or quitted the room leaning on her tortoise shell stick little fury barking at her heels <\s>
<s> tusher the parson's wife was with my lady <\s>
<s> she had been waiting woman to her ladyship in the late lord's time and having her soul in that business took naturally to it when the viscountess of castlewood returned to inhabit her father's house <\s>
<s> i present to your ladyship your kinsman and little page of honor master henry esmond mr <\s>
<s> holt said bowing lowly with a sort of comical humility <\s>
<s> make a pretty bow to my lady monsieur and then another little bow not so low to madame tusher the fair priestess of castlewood <\s>
<s> where i have lived and hope to die sir says madame tusher giving a hard glance at the brat and then at my lady <\s>
<s> upon her the boy's whole attention was for a time directed <\s>
<s> he could not keep his great eyes off from her <\s>
<s> since the empress of ealing he had seen nothing so awful <\s>
<s> does my appearance please you little page <\s>
<s> he would be very hard to please if it didn't cried madame tusher <\s>
<s> have done you silly maria said lady castlewood <\s>
<s> where i'm attached i'm attached madame and i'd die rather than not say so <\s>
<s> je meurs ou je m'attache mr <\s>
<s> holt said with a polite grin <\s>
<s> the ivy says so in the picture and clings to the oak like a fond parasite as it is <\s>
<s> hush tusher you are always bickering with father holt cried my lady <\s>
<s> come and kiss my hand child and the oak held out a branch to little harry esmond who took and dutifully kissed the lean old hand upon the gnarled knuckles of which there glittered a hundred rings <\s>
<s> to kiss that hand would make many a pretty fellow happy <\s>
<s> tusher on which my lady crying out go you foolish tusher <\s>
<s> and tapping her with her great fan tusher ran forward to seize her hand and kiss it <\s>
<s> fury arose and barked furiously at tusher and father holt looked on at this queer scene with arch grave glances <\s>
<s> the awe exhibited by the little boy perhaps pleased the lady to whom this artless flattery was bestowed for having gone down on his knee as father holt had directed him and the mode then was and performed his obeisance she said page esmond my groom of the chamber will inform you what your duties are when you wait upon my lord and me and good father holt will instruct you as becomes a gentleman of our name <\s>
<s> you will pay him obedience in everything and i pray you may grow to be as learned and as good as your tutor <\s>
<s> the lady seemed to have the greatest reverence for mr <\s>
<s> holt and to be more afraid of him than of anything else in the world <\s>
<s> if she was ever so angry a word or look from father holt made her calm indeed he had a vast power of subjecting those who came near him and among the rest his new pupil gave himself up with an entire confidence and attachment to the good father and became his willing slave almost from the first moment he saw him <\s>
<s> he put his small hand into the father's as he walked away from his first presentation to his mistress and asked many questions in his artless childish way <\s>
<s> who is that other woman <\s>
<s> she is fat and round she is more pretty than my lady castlewood <\s>
<s> she is madame tusher the parson's wife of castlewood <\s>
<s> she has a son of your age but bigger than you <\s>
<s> why does she like so to kiss my lady's hand <\s>
<s> it is not good to kiss <\s>
<s> tastes are different little man <\s>
<s> madame tusher is attached to my lady having been her waiting woman before she was married in the old lord's time <\s>
