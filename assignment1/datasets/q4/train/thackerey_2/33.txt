<s> whilst esmond was under the domination of this passion he remembers many a talk he had with his intimates who used to rally our knight of the rueful countenance at his devotion whereof he made no disguise to beatrix and it was with replies such as the above he met his friends satire <\s>
<s> granted i am a fool says he and no better than you but you are no better than i <\s>
<s> you have your folly you labor for give me the charity of mine <\s>
<s> what flatteries do you mr <\s>
<s> john stoop to whisper in the ears of a queen's favorite <\s>
<s> what nights of labor doth not the laziest man in the world endure foregoing his bottle and his boon companions foregoing lais in whose lap he would like to be yawning that he may prepare a speech full of lies to cajole three hundred stupid country gentlemen in the house of commons and get the hiccupping cheers of the october club <\s>
<s> what days will you spend in your jolting chariot <\s>
<s> esmond often rode to windsor and especially of later days with the secretary what hours will you pass on your gouty feet and how humbly will you kneel down to present a despatch you the proudest man in the world that has not knelt to god since you were a boy and in that posture whisper flatter adore almost a stupid woman that's often boozy with too much meat and drink when mr <\s>
<s> secretary goes for his audience <\s>
<s> if my pursuit is vanity sure yours is too <\s>
<s> and then the secretary would fly out in such a rich flow of eloquence as this pen cannot pretend to recall advocating his scheme of ambition showing the great good he would do for his country when he was the undisputed chief of it backing his opinion with a score of pat sentences from greek and roman authorities of which kind of learning he made rather an ostentatious display and scornfully vaunting the very arts and meannesses by which fools were to be made to follow him opponents to be bribed or silenced doubters converted and enemies overawed <\s>
<s> i am diogenes says esmond laughing that is taken up for a ride in alexander's chariot <\s>
<s> i have no desire to vanquish darius or to tame bucephalus <\s>
<s> i do not want what you want a great name or a high place to have them would bring me no pleasure <\s>
<s> but my moderation is taste not virtue and i know that what i do want is as vain as that which you long after <\s>
<s> do not grudge me my vanity if i allow yours or rather let us laugh at both indifferently and at ourselves and at each other <\s>
<s> if your charmer holds out says st <\s>
<s> john at this rate she may keep you twenty years besieging her and surrender by the time you are seventy and she is old enough to be a grandmother <\s>
<s> i do not say the pursuit of a particular woman is not as pleasant a pastime as any other kind of hunting he added only for my part i find the game won't run long enough <\s>
<s> they knock under too soon that's the fault i find with em <\s>
<s> the game which you pursue is in the habit of being caught and used to being pulled down says mr <\s>
<s> but dulcinea del toboso is peerless eh <\s>
<s> well honest harry go and attack windmills perhaps thou art not more mad than other people st <\s>
<s> john added with a sigh <\s>
<s> a paper out of the spectator <\s>
<s> doth any young gentleman of my progeny who may read his old grandfather's papers chance to be presently suffering under the passion of love <\s>
<s> there is a humiliating cure but one that is easy and almost specific for the malady which is to try an alibi <\s>
<s> esmond went away from his mistress and was cured a half dozen times he came back to her side and instantly fell ill again of the fever <\s>
<s> he vowed that he could leave her and think no more of her and so he could pretty well at least succeed in quelling that rage and longing he had whenever he was with her but as soon as he returned he was as bad as ever again <\s>
<s> truly a ludicrous and pitiable object at least exhausting everybody's pity but his dearest mistress's lady castlewood's in whose tender breast he reposed all his dreary confessions and who never tired of hearing him and pleading for him <\s>
<s> sometimes esmond would think there was hope <\s>
<s> then again he would be plagued with despair at some impertinence or coquetry of his mistress <\s>
<s> for days they would be like brother and sister or the dearest friends she simple fond and charming he happy beyond measure at her good behavior <\s>
<s> but this would all vanish on a sudden <\s>
<s> either he would be too pressing and hint his love when she would rebuff him instantly and give his vanity a box on the ear or he would be jealous and with perfect good reason of some new admirer that had sprung up or some rich young gentleman newly arrived in the town that this incorrigible flirt would set her nets and baits to draw in <\s>
<s> if esmond remonstrated the little rebel would say who are you <\s>
<s> i shall go my own way sirrah and that way is towards a husband and i don't want you on the way <\s>
<s> i am for your betters colonel for your betters do you hear that <\s>
<s> you might do if you had an estate and were younger only eight years older than i you say <\s>
<s> pish you are a hundred years older <\s>
<s> you are an old old graveairs and i should make you miserable that would be the only comfort i should have in marrying you <\s>
<s> but you have not money enough to keep a cat decently after you have paid your man his wages and your landlady her bill <\s>
<s> do you think i am going to live in a lodging and turn the mutton at a string whilst your honor nurses the baby <\s>
<s> fiddlestick and why did you not get this nonsense knocked out of your head when you were in the wars <\s>
<s> you are come back more dismal and dreary than ever <\s>
<s> you and mamma are fit for each other <\s>
<s> you might be darby and joan and play cribbage to the end of your lives <\s>
<s> at least you own to your worldliness my poor trix says her mother <\s>
<s> oh my pretty lady <\s>
<s> do you think that i am a child in the nursery and to be frightened by bogey <\s>
<s> worldliness to be sure and pray madam where is the harm of wishing to be comfortable <\s>
