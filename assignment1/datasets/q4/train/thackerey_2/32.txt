<s> asks my dear lady for you know henry she says with her sweet smile i used always to pity esau and i think i am on his side though papa tried very hard to convince me the other way <\s>
<s> says the old lady <\s>
<s> so you want something left to poor harry he he <\s>
<s> reach me the drops cousin <\s>
<s> well then my dear since you want poor harry to have a fortune you must understand that ever since the year 1691 a week after the battle of the boyne where the prince of orange defeated his royal sovereign and father for which crime he is now suffering in flames ugh <\s>
<s> ugh henry esmond hath been marquis of esmond and earl of castlewood in the united kingdom and baron and viscount castlewood of shandon in ireland and a baronet and his eldest son will be by courtesy styled earl of castlewood he <\s>
<s> what do you think of that my dear <\s>
<s> how long have you known this <\s>
<s> cries the other lady thinking perhaps that the old marchioness was wandering in her wits <\s>
<s> my husband before he was converted was a wicked wretch the sick sinner continued <\s>
<s> when he was in the low countries he seduced a weaver's daughter and added to his wickedness by marrying her <\s>
<s> and then he came to this country and married me a poor girl a poor innocent young thing i say though she was past forty you know harry when she married and as for being innocent well she went on i knew nothing of my lord's wickedness for three years after our marriage and after the burial of our poor little boy i had it done over again my dear i had myself married by father holt in castlewood chapel as soon as ever i heard the creature was dead and having a great illness then arising from another sad disappointment i had the priest came and told me that my lord had a son before our marriage and that the child was at nurse in england and i consented to let the brat be brought home and a queer little melancholy child it was when it came <\s>
<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>
<s> and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king's business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water <\s>
<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>
<s> but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favor that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king's service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king <\s>
<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>
<s> holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper <\s>
<s> then his sudden death came and there was a thought of declaring the truth <\s>
<s> but twas determined to be best for the king's service to let the title still go with the younger branch and there's no sacrifice a castlewood wouldn't make for that cause my dear <\s>
<s> as for colonel esmond he knew the truth already <\s>
<s> and then harry my mistress said she told me of what had happened at my dear husband's death bed <\s>
<s> he doth not intend to take the title though it belongs to him <\s>
<s> but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear <\s>
<s> and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank <\s>
<s> this was the substance of the dowager's revelation <\s>
<s> dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death bed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean's advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide <\s>
<s> and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be <\s>
<s> it rests with you harry as the head of our house <\s>
<s> it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord's bedside says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> the children must know nothing of this <\s>
<s> frank and his heirs after him must bear our name <\s>
<s> tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his death bed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood <\s>
<s> i would not seek it when i was abroad <\s>
<s> i went and looked at my poor mother's grave in her convent <\s>
<s> what matter to her now <\s>
<s> no court of law on earth upon my mere word would deprive my lord viscount and set me up <\s>
<s> i am the head of the house dear lady but frank is viscount of castlewood still <\s>
<s> and rather than disturb him i would turn monk or disappear in america <\s>
<s> as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part <\s>
<s> to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends <\s>
<s> dearest saint says he purest soul that has had so much to suffer that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love <\s>
<s> tis for me to kneel not for you tis for me to be thankful that i can make you happy <\s>

<s> before such a partial judge as esmond's dear mistress owned herself to be any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer of her son's marriage to a foreign lady papist though she was <\s>

<s> castlewood knew very well so she wrote to her son that she never denied him anything in her power to give much less would she think of opposing a marriage that was to make his happiness as she trusted and keep him out of wild courses which had alarmed her a good deal and she besought him to come quickly to england to settle down in his family house of castlewood it is his family house says she to colonel esmond though only his own house by your forbearance and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years minority <\s>

<s> and have you left poor harry nothing <\s>
<s> asks my dear lady for you know henry she says with her sweet smile i used always to pity esau and i think i am on his side though papa tried very hard to convince me the other way <\s>
<s> says the old lady <\s>
<s> so you want something left to poor harry he he <\s>
<s> reach me the drops cousin <\s>
<s> well then my dear since you want poor harry to have a fortune you must understand that ever since the year 1691 a week after the battle of the boyne where the prince of orange defeated his royal sovereign and father for which crime he is now suffering in flames ugh <\s>
<s> ugh henry esmond hath been marquis of esmond and earl of castlewood in the united kingdom and baron and viscount castlewood of shandon in ireland and a baronet and his eldest son will be by courtesy styled earl of castlewood he <\s>
<s> what do you think of that my dear <\s>
<s> how long have you known this <\s>
<s> cries the other lady thinking perhaps that the old marchioness was wandering in her wits <\s>
<s> my husband before he was converted was a wicked wretch the sick sinner continued <\s>
<s> when he was in the low countries he seduced a weaver's daughter and added to his wickedness by marrying her <\s>
<s> and then he came to this country and married me a poor girl a poor innocent young thing i say though she was past forty you know harry when she married and as for being innocent well she went on i knew nothing of my lord's wickedness for three years after our marriage and after the burial of our poor little boy i had it done over again my dear i had myself married by father holt in castlewood chapel as soon as ever i heard the creature was dead and having a great illness then arising from another sad disappointment i had the priest came and told me that my lord had a son before our marriage and that the child was at nurse in england and i consented to let the brat be brought home and a queer little melancholy child it was when it came <\s>
<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>
<s> and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king's business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water <\s>
<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>
<s> but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favor that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king's service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king <\s>
<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>
<s> holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper <\s>
<s> then his sudden death came and there was a thought of declaring the truth <\s>
<s> but twas determined to be best for the king's service to let the title still go with the younger branch and there's no sacrifice a castlewood wouldn't make for that cause my dear <\s>
<s> as for colonel esmond he knew the truth already <\s>
<s> and then harry my mistress said she told me of what had happened at my dear husband's death bed <\s>
<s> he doth not intend to take the title though it belongs to him <\s>
<s> but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear <\s>
<s> and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank <\s>
<s> this was the substance of the dowager's revelation <\s>
<s> dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death bed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean's advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide <\s>
<s> and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be <\s>
<s> it rests with you harry as the head of our house <\s>
<s> it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord's bedside says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> the children must know nothing of this <\s>
<s> frank and his heirs after him must bear our name <\s>
<s> tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his death bed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood <\s>
<s> i would not seek it when i was abroad <\s>
<s> i went and looked at my poor mother's grave in her convent <\s>
<s> what matter to her now <\s>
<s> no court of law on earth upon my mere word would deprive my lord viscount and set me up <\s>
<s> i am the head of the house dear lady but frank is viscount of castlewood still <\s>
<s> and rather than disturb him i would turn monk or disappear in america <\s>
<s> as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part <\s>
<s> to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends <\s>
<s> dearest saint says he purest soul that has had so much to suffer that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love <\s>
<s> tis for me to kneel not for you tis for me to be thankful that i can make you happy <\s>
<s> hath my life any other aim <\s>
<s> blessed be god that i can serve you <\s>
<s> what pleasure think you could all the world give me compared to that <\s>
<s> don't raise me she said in a wild way to esmond who would have lifted her <\s>
<s> let me kneel let me kneel and and worship you <\s>
<s> before such a partial judge as esmond's dear mistress owned herself to be any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer of her son's marriage to a foreign lady papist though she was <\s>
<s> lady castlewood never could be brought to think so ill of that religion as other people in england thought of it she held that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the catholic church but that the roman was one of the main stems on which no doubt many errors had been grafted she was for a woman extraordinarily well versed in this controversy having acted as a girl as secretary to her father the late dean and written many of his sermons under his dictation ); and if frank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south europe as she would call the roman communion there was no need why she should not welcome her as a daughter in law and accordingly she wrote to her new daughter a very pretty touching letter as esmond thought who had cognizance of it before it went in which the only hint of reproof was a gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself to ask a fond mother's blessing for that step which he was about taking <\s>
<s> castlewood knew very well so she wrote to her son that she never denied him anything in her power to give much less would she think of opposing a marriage that was to make his happiness as she trusted and keep him out of wild courses which had alarmed her a good deal and she besought him to come quickly to england to settle down in his family house of castlewood it is his family house says she to colonel esmond though only his own house by your forbearance and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years minority <\s>
<s> by care and frugality she had got the estate into a better condition than ever it had been since the parliamentary wars and my lord was now master of a pretty small income not encumbered of debts as it had been during his father's ruinous time <\s>

<s> and indeed this was the case her ladyship's daughter complaining that their mother did all for frank and nothing for her and frank himself being dissatisfied at the narrow simple way of his mother's living at walcote where he had been brought up more like a poor parson's son than a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world <\s>
<s> twas this mistake in his early training very likely that set him so eager upon pleasure when he had it in his power nor is he the first lad that has been spoiled by the over careful fondness of women <\s>
<s> no training is so useful for children great or small as the company of their betters in rank or natural parts in whose society they lose the overweening sense of their own importance which stay at home people very commonly learn <\s>

<s> and have you left poor harry nothing <\s>
<s> asks my dear lady for you know henry she says with her sweet smile i used always to pity esau and i think i am on his side though papa tried very hard to convince me the other way <\s>
<s> says the old lady <\s>
<s> so you want something left to poor harry he he <\s>
<s> reach me the drops cousin <\s>
<s> well then my dear since you want poor harry to have a fortune you must understand that ever since the year 1691 a week after the battle of the boyne where the prince of orange defeated his royal sovereign and father for which crime he is now suffering in flames ugh <\s>
<s> ugh henry esmond hath been marquis of esmond and earl of castlewood in the united kingdom and baron and viscount castlewood of shandon in ireland and a baronet and his eldest son will be by courtesy styled earl of castlewood he <\s>
<s> what do you think of that my dear <\s>
<s> how long have you known this <\s>
<s> cries the other lady thinking perhaps that the old marchioness was wandering in her wits <\s>
<s> my husband before he was converted was a wicked wretch the sick sinner continued <\s>
<s> when he was in the low countries he seduced a weaver's daughter and added to his wickedness by marrying her <\s>
<s> and then he came to this country and married me a poor girl a poor innocent young thing i say though she was past forty you know harry when she married and as for being innocent well she went on i knew nothing of my lord's wickedness for three years after our marriage and after the burial of our poor little boy i had it done over again my dear i had myself married by father holt in castlewood chapel as soon as ever i heard the creature was dead and having a great illness then arising from another sad disappointment i had the priest came and told me that my lord had a son before our marriage and that the child was at nurse in england and i consented to let the brat be brought home and a queer little melancholy child it was when it came <\s>
<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>
<s> and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king's business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water <\s>
<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>
<s> but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favor that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king's service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king <\s>
<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>
<s> holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper <\s>
<s> then his sudden death came and there was a thought of declaring the truth <\s>
<s> but twas determined to be best for the king's service to let the title still go with the younger branch and there's no sacrifice a castlewood wouldn't make for that cause my dear <\s>
<s> as for colonel esmond he knew the truth already <\s>
<s> and then harry my mistress said she told me of what had happened at my dear husband's death bed <\s>
<s> he doth not intend to take the title though it belongs to him <\s>
<s> but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear <\s>
<s> and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank <\s>
<s> this was the substance of the dowager's revelation <\s>
<s> dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death bed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean's advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide <\s>
<s> and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be <\s>
<s> it rests with you harry as the head of our house <\s>
<s> it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord's bedside says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> the children must know nothing of this <\s>
<s> frank and his heirs after him must bear our name <\s>
<s> tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his death bed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood <\s>
<s> i would not seek it when i was abroad <\s>
<s> i went and looked at my poor mother's grave in her convent <\s>
<s> what matter to her now <\s>
<s> no court of law on earth upon my mere word would deprive my lord viscount and set me up <\s>
<s> i am the head of the house dear lady but frank is viscount of castlewood still <\s>
<s> and rather than disturb him i would turn monk or disappear in america <\s>
<s> as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part <\s>
<s> to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends <\s>
<s> dearest saint says he purest soul that has had so much to suffer that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love <\s>
<s> tis for me to kneel not for you tis for me to be thankful that i can make you happy <\s>
<s> hath my life any other aim <\s>
<s> blessed be god that i can serve you <\s>
<s> what pleasure think you could all the world give me compared to that <\s>
<s> don't raise me she said in a wild way to esmond who would have lifted her <\s>
<s> let me kneel let me kneel and and worship you <\s>
<s> before such a partial judge as esmond's dear mistress owned herself to be any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer of her son's marriage to a foreign lady papist though she was <\s>
<s> lady castlewood never could be brought to think so ill of that religion as other people in england thought of it she held that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the catholic church but that the roman was one of the main stems on which no doubt many errors had been grafted she was for a woman extraordinarily well versed in this controversy having acted as a girl as secretary to her father the late dean and written many of his sermons under his dictation ); and if frank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south europe as she would call the roman communion there was no need why she should not welcome her as a daughter in law and accordingly she wrote to her new daughter a very pretty touching letter as esmond thought who had cognizance of it before it went in which the only hint of reproof was a gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself to ask a fond mother's blessing for that step which he was about taking <\s>
<s> castlewood knew very well so she wrote to her son that she never denied him anything in her power to give much less would she think of opposing a marriage that was to make his happiness as she trusted and keep him out of wild courses which had alarmed her a good deal and she besought him to come quickly to england to settle down in his family house of castlewood it is his family house says she to colonel esmond though only his own house by your forbearance and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years minority <\s>
<s> by care and frugality she had got the estate into a better condition than ever it had been since the parliamentary wars and my lord was now master of a pretty small income not encumbered of debts as it had been during his father's ruinous time <\s>
<s> but in saving my son's fortune says she i fear i have lost a great part of my hold on him <\s>
<s> and indeed this was the case her ladyship's daughter complaining that their mother did all for frank and nothing for her and frank himself being dissatisfied at the narrow simple way of his mother's living at walcote where he had been brought up more like a poor parson's son than a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world <\s>
<s> twas this mistake in his early training very likely that set him so eager upon pleasure when he had it in his power nor is he the first lad that has been spoiled by the over careful fondness of women <\s>
<s> no training is so useful for children great or small as the company of their betters in rank or natural parts in whose society they lose the overweening sense of their own importance which stay at home people very commonly learn <\s>
<s> but as a prodigal that's sending in a schedule of his debts to his friends never puts all down and you may be sure the rogue keeps back some immense swingeing bill that he doesn't dare to own so the poor frank had a very heavy piece of news to break to his mother and which he hadn't the courage to introduce into his first confession <\s>

<s> ugh henry esmond hath been marquis of esmond and earl of castlewood in the united kingdom and baron and viscount castlewood of shandon in ireland and a baronet and his eldest son will be by courtesy styled earl of castlewood he <\s>
<s> what do you think of that my dear <\s>
<s> how long have you known this <\s>
<s> cries the other lady thinking perhaps that the old marchioness was wandering in her wits <\s>
<s> my husband before he was converted was a wicked wretch the sick sinner continued <\s>
<s> when he was in the low countries he seduced a weaver's daughter and added to his wickedness by marrying her <\s>
<s> and then he came to this country and married me a poor girl a poor innocent young thing i say though she was past forty you know harry when she married and as for being innocent well she went on i knew nothing of my lord's wickedness for three years after our marriage and after the burial of our poor little boy i had it done over again my dear i had myself married by father holt in castlewood chapel as soon as ever i heard the creature was dead and having a great illness then arising from another sad disappointment i had the priest came and told me that my lord had a son before our marriage and that the child was at nurse in england and i consented to let the brat be brought home and a queer little melancholy child it was when it came <\s>
<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>
<s> and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king's business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water <\s>
<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>
<s> but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favor that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king's service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king <\s>
<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>
<s> holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper <\s>
<s> then his sudden death came and there was a thought of declaring the truth <\s>
<s> but twas determined to be best for the king's service to let the title still go with the younger branch and there's no sacrifice a castlewood wouldn't make for that cause my dear <\s>
<s> as for colonel esmond he knew the truth already <\s>
<s> and then harry my mistress said she told me of what had happened at my dear husband's death bed <\s>
<s> he doth not intend to take the title though it belongs to him <\s>
<s> but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear <\s>
<s> and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank <\s>
<s> this was the substance of the dowager's revelation <\s>
<s> dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death bed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean's advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide <\s>
<s> and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be <\s>
<s> it rests with you harry as the head of our house <\s>
<s> it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord's bedside says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> the children must know nothing of this <\s>
<s> frank and his heirs after him must bear our name <\s>
<s> tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his death bed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood <\s>
<s> i would not seek it when i was abroad <\s>
<s> i went and looked at my poor mother's grave in her convent <\s>
<s> what matter to her now <\s>
<s> no court of law on earth upon my mere word would deprive my lord viscount and set me up <\s>
<s> i am the head of the house dear lady but frank is viscount of castlewood still <\s>
<s> and rather than disturb him i would turn monk or disappear in america <\s>
<s> as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part <\s>
<s> to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends <\s>
<s> dearest saint says he purest soul that has had so much to suffer that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love <\s>
<s> tis for me to kneel not for you tis for me to be thankful that i can make you happy <\s>
<s> hath my life any other aim <\s>
<s> blessed be god that i can serve you <\s>
<s> what pleasure think you could all the world give me compared to that <\s>
<s> don't raise me she said in a wild way to esmond who would have lifted her <\s>
<s> let me kneel let me kneel and and worship you <\s>
<s> before such a partial judge as esmond's dear mistress owned herself to be any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer of her son's marriage to a foreign lady papist though she was <\s>
<s> lady castlewood never could be brought to think so ill of that religion as other people in england thought of it she held that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the catholic church but that the roman was one of the main stems on which no doubt many errors had been grafted she was for a woman extraordinarily well versed in this controversy having acted as a girl as secretary to her father the late dean and written many of his sermons under his dictation ); and if frank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south europe as she would call the roman communion there was no need why she should not welcome her as a daughter in law and accordingly she wrote to her new daughter a very pretty touching letter as esmond thought who had cognizance of it before it went in which the only hint of reproof was a gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself to ask a fond mother's blessing for that step which he was about taking <\s>
<s> castlewood knew very well so she wrote to her son that she never denied him anything in her power to give much less would she think of opposing a marriage that was to make his happiness as she trusted and keep him out of wild courses which had alarmed her a good deal and she besought him to come quickly to england to settle down in his family house of castlewood it is his family house says she to colonel esmond though only his own house by your forbearance and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years minority <\s>
<s> by care and frugality she had got the estate into a better condition than ever it had been since the parliamentary wars and my lord was now master of a pretty small income not encumbered of debts as it had been during his father's ruinous time <\s>
<s> but in saving my son's fortune says she i fear i have lost a great part of my hold on him <\s>
<s> and indeed this was the case her ladyship's daughter complaining that their mother did all for frank and nothing for her and frank himself being dissatisfied at the narrow simple way of his mother's living at walcote where he had been brought up more like a poor parson's son than a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world <\s>
<s> twas this mistake in his early training very likely that set him so eager upon pleasure when he had it in his power nor is he the first lad that has been spoiled by the over careful fondness of women <\s>
<s> no training is so useful for children great or small as the company of their betters in rank or natural parts in whose society they lose the overweening sense of their own importance which stay at home people very commonly learn <\s>
<s> but as a prodigal that's sending in a schedule of his debts to his friends never puts all down and you may be sure the rogue keeps back some immense swingeing bill that he doesn't dare to own so the poor frank had a very heavy piece of news to break to his mother and which he hadn't the courage to introduce into his first confession <\s>
<s> some misgivings esmond might have upon receiving frank's letter and knowing into what hands the boy had fallen but whatever these misgivings were he kept them to himself not caring to trouble his mistress with any fears that might be groundless <\s>

<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>

<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>

<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>

<s> and then he came to this country and married me a poor girl a poor innocent young thing i say though she was past forty you know harry when she married and as for being innocent well she went on i knew nothing of my lord's wickedness for three years after our marriage and after the burial of our poor little boy i had it done over again my dear i had myself married by father holt in castlewood chapel as soon as ever i heard the creature was dead and having a great illness then arising from another sad disappointment i had the priest came and told me that my lord had a son before our marriage and that the child was at nurse in england and i consented to let the brat be brought home and a queer little melancholy child it was when it came <\s>
<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>
<s> and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king's business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water <\s>
<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>
<s> but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favor that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king's service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king <\s>
<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>
<s> holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper <\s>

<s> but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear <\s>
<s> and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank <\s>
<s> this was the substance of the dowager's revelation <\s>
<s> dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death bed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean's advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide <\s>
<s> and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be <\s>

<s> it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord's bedside says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> the children must know nothing of this <\s>
<s> frank and his heirs after him must bear our name <\s>
<s> tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his death bed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood <\s>

<s> as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part <\s>
<s> to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends <\s>

<s> our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman <\s>

<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>

<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>

<s> and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king's business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water <\s>
<s> should i be disappointed i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir <\s>
<s> but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favor that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king's service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king <\s>
<s> and a proof of this is that a year before your husband's death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr <\s>
<s> holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper <\s>
<s> then his sudden death came and there was a thought of declaring the truth <\s>
<s> but twas determined to be best for the king's service to let the title still go with the younger branch and there's no sacrifice a castlewood wouldn't make for that cause my dear <\s>
<s> as for colonel esmond he knew the truth already <\s>
<s> and then harry my mistress said she told me of what had happened at my dear husband's death bed <\s>
<s> he doth not intend to take the title though it belongs to him <\s>
<s> but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear <\s>
<s> and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank <\s>
<s> this was the substance of the dowager's revelation <\s>
<s> dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death bed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean's advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide <\s>
<s> and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be <\s>
<s> it rests with you harry as the head of our house <\s>
<s> it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord's bedside says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> the children must know nothing of this <\s>
<s> frank and his heirs after him must bear our name <\s>
<s> tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his death bed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood <\s>
<s> i would not seek it when i was abroad <\s>
<s> i went and looked at my poor mother's grave in her convent <\s>
<s> what matter to her now <\s>
<s> no court of law on earth upon my mere word would deprive my lord viscount and set me up <\s>
<s> i am the head of the house dear lady but frank is viscount of castlewood still <\s>
<s> and rather than disturb him i would turn monk or disappear in america <\s>
<s> as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part <\s>
<s> to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends <\s>
<s> dearest saint says he purest soul that has had so much to suffer that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love <\s>
<s> tis for me to kneel not for you tis for me to be thankful that i can make you happy <\s>
<s> hath my life any other aim <\s>
<s> blessed be god that i can serve you <\s>
<s> what pleasure think you could all the world give me compared to that <\s>
<s> don't raise me she said in a wild way to esmond who would have lifted her <\s>
<s> let me kneel let me kneel and and worship you <\s>
<s> before such a partial judge as esmond's dear mistress owned herself to be any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer of her son's marriage to a foreign lady papist though she was <\s>
<s> lady castlewood never could be brought to think so ill of that religion as other people in england thought of it she held that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the catholic church but that the roman was one of the main stems on which no doubt many errors had been grafted she was for a woman extraordinarily well versed in this controversy having acted as a girl as secretary to her father the late dean and written many of his sermons under his dictation ); and if frank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south europe as she would call the roman communion there was no need why she should not welcome her as a daughter in law and accordingly she wrote to her new daughter a very pretty touching letter as esmond thought who had cognizance of it before it went in which the only hint of reproof was a gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself to ask a fond mother's blessing for that step which he was about taking <\s>
<s> castlewood knew very well so she wrote to her son that she never denied him anything in her power to give much less would she think of opposing a marriage that was to make his happiness as she trusted and keep him out of wild courses which had alarmed her a good deal and she besought him to come quickly to england to settle down in his family house of castlewood it is his family house says she to colonel esmond though only his own house by your forbearance and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years minority <\s>
<s> by care and frugality she had got the estate into a better condition than ever it had been since the parliamentary wars and my lord was now master of a pretty small income not encumbered of debts as it had been during his father's ruinous time <\s>
<s> but in saving my son's fortune says she i fear i have lost a great part of my hold on him <\s>
<s> and indeed this was the case her ladyship's daughter complaining that their mother did all for frank and nothing for her and frank himself being dissatisfied at the narrow simple way of his mother's living at walcote where he had been brought up more like a poor parson's son than a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world <\s>
<s> twas this mistake in his early training very likely that set him so eager upon pleasure when he had it in his power nor is he the first lad that has been spoiled by the over careful fondness of women <\s>
<s> no training is so useful for children great or small as the company of their betters in rank or natural parts in whose society they lose the overweening sense of their own importance which stay at home people very commonly learn <\s>
<s> but as a prodigal that's sending in a schedule of his debts to his friends never puts all down and you may be sure the rogue keeps back some immense swingeing bill that he doesn't dare to own so the poor frank had a very heavy piece of news to break to his mother and which he hadn't the courage to introduce into his first confession <\s>
<s> some misgivings esmond might have upon receiving frank's letter and knowing into what hands the boy had fallen but whatever these misgivings were he kept them to himself not caring to trouble his mistress with any fears that might be groundless <\s>
<s> however the next mail which came from bruxelles after frank had received his mother's letters there brought back a joint composition from himself and his wife who could spell no better than her young scapegrace of a husband full of expressions of thanks love and duty to the dowager viscountess as my poor lady now was styled and along with this letter which was read in a family council namely the viscountess mistress beatrix and the writer of this memoir and which was pronounced to be vulgar by the maid of honor and felt to be so by the other two there came a private letter for colonel esmond from poor frank with another dismal commission for the colonel to execute at his best opportunity and this was to announce that frank had seen fit by the exhortation of mr <\s>
<s> holt the influence of his clotilda and the blessing of heaven and the saints says my lord demurely to change his religion and be received into the bosom of that church of which his sovereign many of his family and the greater part of the civilized world were members <\s>
<s> and his lordship added a postscript of which esmond knew the inspiring genius very well for it had the genuine twang of the seminary and was quite unlike poor frank's ordinary style of writing and thinking in which he reminded colonel esmond that he too was by birth of that church and that his mother and sister should have his lordship's prayers to the saints an inestimable benefit truly for their conversion <\s>
<s> if esmond had wanted to keep this secret he could not for a day or two after receiving this letter a notice from bruxelles appeared in the post boy and other prints announcing that a young irish lord the viscount c stlew d just come to his majority and who had served the last campaigns with great credit as aide de camp to his grace the duke of marlborough had declared for the popish religion at bruxelles and had walked in a procession barefoot with a wax taper in his hand <\s>
<s> holt who had been employed as a jacobite agent during the last reign and many times pardoned by king william had been the post boy said the agent of this conversion <\s>
<s> the lady castlewood was as much cast down by this news as miss beatrix was indignant at it <\s>
<s> so says she castlewood is no longer a home for us mother <\s>
<s> frank's foreign wife will bring her confessor and there will be frogs for dinner and all tusher's and my grandfather's sermons are flung away upon my brother <\s>
<s> i used to tell you that you killed him with the catechism and that he would turn wicked as soon as he broke from his mammy's leading strings <\s>
<s> oh mother you would not believe that the young scapegrace was playing you tricks and that sneak of a tusher was not a fit guide for him <\s>
<s> oh those parsons i hate em all <\s>
<s> says mistress beatrix clapping her hands together yes whether they wear cassocks and buckles or beards and bare feet <\s>
<s> there's a horrid irish wretch who never misses a sunday at court and who pays me compliments there the horrible man and if you want to know what parsons are you should see his behavior and hear him talk of his own cloth <\s>
<s> they're all the same whether they're bishops or bonzes or indian fakirs <\s>
<s> they try to domineer and they frighten us with kingdom come and they wear a sanctified air in public and expect us to go down on our knees and ask their blessing and they intrigue and they grasp and they backbite and they slander worse than the worst courtier or the wickedest old woman <\s>
<s> i heard this mr <\s>
<s> swift sneering at my lord duke of marlborough's courage the other day <\s>
<s> that teague from dublin <\s>
<s> because his grace is not in favor dares to say this of him and he says this that it may get to her majesty's ear and to coax and wheedle mrs <\s>
<s> they say the elector of hanover has a dozen of mistresses in his court at herrenhausen and if he comes to be king over us i wager that the bishops and mr <\s>
<s> swift that wants to be one will coax and wheedle them <\s>
<s> oh those priests and their grave airs <\s>
<s> i'm sick of their square toes and their rustling cassocks <\s>
<s> i should like to go to a country where there was not one or turn quaker and get rid of em and i would only the dress is not becoming and i've much too pretty a figure to hide it <\s>
<s> and here she glanced at her person and the looking glass which told her rightly that a more beautiful shape and face never were seen <\s>
<s> i made that onslaught on the priests says miss beatrix afterwards in order to divert my poor dear mother's anguish about frank <\s>
<s> frank is as vain as a girl cousin <\s>
<s> talk of us girls being vain what are we to you <\s>
<s> it was easy to see that the first woman who chose would make a fool of him or the first robe i count a priest and a woman all the same <\s>
<s> we are always caballing we are not answerable for the fibs we tell we are always cajoling and coaxing or threatening and we are always making mischief colonel esmond mark my word for that who know the world sir and have to make my way in it <\s>
<s> i see as well as possible how frank's marriage hath been managed <\s>
<s> the count our papa in law is always away at the coffee house <\s>
<s> the countess our mother is always in the kitchen looking after the dinner <\s>
