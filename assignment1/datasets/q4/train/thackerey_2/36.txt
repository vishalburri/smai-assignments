<s> his grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take mr <\s>
<s> esmond as secretary on his paris embassy but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected at any rate esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the church door after her marriage and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him <\s>

<s> but i think the lowest depth of marlborough's fall was when he humbly sent to ask general webb when he might wait upon him he who had commanded the stout old general who had injured him and sneered at him who had kept him dangling in his ante chamber who could not even after his great service condescend to write him a letter in his own hand <\s>

<s> when does your excellency go for paris <\s>
<s> as soon after the ceremony as may be his grace answered <\s>
<s> tis fixed for the first of december it cannot be sooner <\s>
<s> the equipage will not be ready till then <\s>
<s> the queen intends the embassy should be very grand and i have law business to settle <\s>
<s> that ill omened mohun has come or is coming to london again we are in a lawsuit about my late lord gerard's property and he hath sent to me to meet him <\s>
<s> mohun appears for the last time in this history <\s>
<s> besides my lord duke of hamilton and brandon who for family reasons had kindly promised his protection and patronage to colonel esmond he had other great friends in power now both able and willing to assist him and he might with such allies look forward to as fortunate advancement in civil life at home as he had got rapid promotion abroad <\s>
<s> his grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take mr <\s>
<s> esmond as secretary on his paris embassy but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected at any rate esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the church door after her marriage and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him <\s>
<s> other gentlemen in power were liberal at least of compliments and promises to colonel esmond <\s>
<s> harley now become my lord oxford and mortimer and installed knight of the garter on the same day as his grace of hamilton had received the same honor sent to the colonel to say that a seat in parliament should be at his disposal presently and mr <\s>
<s> john held out many flattering hopes of advancement to the colonel when he should enter the house <\s>
<s> esmond's friends were all successful and the most successful and triumphant of all was his dear old commander general webb who was now appointed lieutenant general of the land forces and received with particular honor by the ministry by the queen and the people out of doors who huzza'd the brave chief when they used to see him in his chariot going to the house or to the drawing room or hobbling on foot to his coach from st <\s>
<s> stephen's upon his glorious old crutch and stick and cheered him as loud as they had ever done marlborough <\s>
<s> that great duke was utterly disgraced and honest old webb dated all his grace's misfortunes from wynendael and vowed that fate served the traitor right <\s>
<s> duchess sarah had also gone to ruin she had been forced to give up her keys and her places and her pensions ah ah <\s>
<s> says webb she would have locked up three millions of french crowns with her keys had i but been knocked on the head but i stopped that convoy at wynendael <\s>
<s> our enemy cardonnel was turned out of the house of commons along with mr <\s>
<s> walpole for malversation of public money <\s>
<s> cadogan lost his place of lieutenant of the tower <\s>
<s> marlborough's daughters resigned their posts of ladies of the bedchamber and so complete was the duke's disgrace that his son in law lord bridgewater was absolutely obliged to give up his lodgings at st <\s>
<s> james's and had his half pension as master of the horse taken away <\s>
<s> but i think the lowest depth of marlborough's fall was when he humbly sent to ask general webb when he might wait upon him he who had commanded the stout old general who had injured him and sneered at him who had kept him dangling in his ante chamber who could not even after his great service condescend to write him a letter in his own hand <\s>
<s> the nation was as eager for peace as ever it had been hot for war <\s>
<s> the prince of savoy came amongst us had his audience of the queen and got his famous sword of honor and strove with all his force to form a whig party together to bring over the young prince of hanover to do anything which might prolong the war and consummate the ruin of the old sovereign whom he hated so implacably <\s>
<s> but the nation was tired of the struggle so completely wearied of it that not even our defeat at denain could rouse us into any anger though such an action so lost two years before would have set all england in a fury <\s>
<s> twas easy to see that the great marlborough was not with the army <\s>
<s> eugene was obliged to fall back in a rage and forego the dazzling revenge of his life <\s>
