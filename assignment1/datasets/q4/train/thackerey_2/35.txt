<s> his lordship was a widower having married in 1698 elizabeth daughter of digby lord gerard by which marriage great estates came into the hamilton family and out of these estates came in part that tragic quarrel which ended the duke's career <\s>
<s> from the loss of a tooth to that of a mistress there's no pang that is not bearable <\s>
<s> the apprehension is much more cruel than the certainty and we make up our mind to the misfortune when tis irremediable part with the tormentor and mumble our crust on t'other side of the jaws <\s>
<s> i think colonel esmond was relieved when a ducal coach and six came and whisked his charmer away out of his reach and placed her in a higher sphere <\s>
<s> as you have seen the nymph in the opera machine go up to the clouds at the end of the piece where mars bacchus apollo and all the divine company of olympians are seated and quaver out her last song as a goddess so when this portentous elevation was accomplished in the esmond family i am not sure that every one of us did not treat the divine beatrix with special honors at least the saucy little beauty carried her head with a toss of supreme authority and assumed a touch me not air which all her friends very good humoredly bowed to <\s>
<s> an old army acquaintance of colonel esmond's honest tom trett who had sold his company married a wife and turned merchant in the city was dreadfully gloomy for a long time though living in a fine house on the river and carrying on a great trade to all appearance <\s>
<s> at length esmond saw his friend's name in the gazette as a bankrupt and a week after this circumstance my bankrupt walks into mr <\s>
<s> esmond's lodging with a face perfectly radiant with good humor and as jolly and careless as when they had sailed from southampton ten years before for vigo <\s>
<s> this bankruptcy says tom has been hanging over my head these three years the thought hath prevented my sleeping and i have looked at poor polly's head on t'other pillow and then towards my razor on the table and thought to put an end to myself and so give my woes the slip <\s>
<s> but now we are bankrupts tom trett pays as many shillings in the pound as he can his wife has a little cottage at fulham and her fortune secured to herself <\s>
<s> i am afraid neither of bailiff nor of creditor and for the last six nights have slept easy <\s>
<s> so it was that when fortune shook her wings and left him honest tom cuddled himself up in his ragged virtue and fell asleep <\s>
<s> esmond did not tell his friend how much his story applied to esmond too but he laughed at it and used it and having fairly struck his docket in this love transaction determined to put a cheerful face on his bankruptcy <\s>
<s> perhaps beatrix was a little offended at his gayety <\s>
<s> is this the way sir that you receive the announcement of your misfortune says she and do you come smiling before me as if you were glad to be rid of me <\s>
<s> esmond would not be put off from his good humor but told her the story of tom trett and his bankruptcy <\s>
<s> i have been hankering after the grapes on the wall says he and lost my temper because they were beyond my reach was there any wonder <\s>
<s> they're gone now and another has them a taller man than your humble servant has won them <\s>
<s> and the colonel made his cousin a low bow <\s>
<s> a taller man cousin esmond <\s>
<s> a man of spirit would have sealed the wall sir and seized them <\s>
<s> a man of courage would have fought for em not gaped for em <\s>
<s> a duke has but to gape and they drop into his mouth says esmond with another low bow <\s>
<s> yes sir says she a duke is a taller man than you <\s>
<s> and why should i not be grateful to one such as his grace who gives me his heart and his great name <\s>
<s> it is a great gift he honors me with i know tis a bargain between us and i accept it and will do my utmost to perform my part of it <\s>
<s> tis no question of sighing and philandering between a noble man of his grace's age and a girl who hath little of that softness in her nature <\s>
<s> why should i not own that i am ambitious harry esmond and if it be no sin in a man to covet honor why should a woman too not desire it <\s>
<s> shall i be frank with you harry and say that if you had not been down on your knees and so humble you might have fared better with me <\s>
<s> a woman of my spirit cousin is to be won by gallantry and not by sighs and rueful faces <\s>
<s> all the time you are worshipping and singing hymns to me i know very well i am no goddess and grow weary of the incense <\s>
<s> so would you have been weary of the goddess too when she was called mrs <\s>
<s> esmond and got out of humor because she had not pin money enough and was forced to go about in an old gown <\s>
<s> cousin a goddess in a mob cap that has to make her husband's gruel ceases to be divine i am sure of it <\s>
<s> i should have been sulky and scolded and of all the proud wretches in the world mr <\s>
<s> esmond is the proudest let me tell him that <\s>
<s> you never fall into a passion but you never forgive i think <\s>
<s> had you been a great man you might have been good humored but being nobody sir you are too great a man for me and i'm afraid of you cousin there <\s>
<s> and i won't worship you and you'll never be happy except with a woman who will <\s>
<s> why after i belonged to you and after one of my tantrums you would have put the pillow over my head some night and smothered me as the black man does the woman in the play that you're so fond of <\s>
<s> what's the creature's name desdemona <\s>
<s> you would you little black dyed othello <\s>
<s> i think i should beatrix says the colonel <\s>
<s> and i want no such ending <\s>
<s> i intend to live to be a hundred and to go to ten thousand routs and balls and to play cards every night of my life till the year eighteen hundred <\s>
<s> and i like to be the first of my company sir and i like flattery and compliments and you give me none and i like to be made to laugh sir and who's to laugh at your dismal face i should like to know <\s>
<s> and i like a coach and six or a coach and eight and i like diamonds and a new gown every week and people to say 'that's the duchess how well her grace looks make way for madame l'ambassadrice d'angleterre call her excellency's people' that's what i like <\s>
<s> and as for you you want a woman to bring your slippers and cap and to sit at your feet and cry o caro <\s>
<s> whilst you read your shakespeares and miltons and stuff <\s>
<s> mamma would have been the wife for you had you been a little older though you look ten years older than she does you do you glum faced blue bearded little old man <\s>
<s> you might have sat like darby and joan and flattered each other and billed and cooed like a pair of old pigeons on a perch <\s>
<s> i want my wings and to use them sir <\s>
<s> and she spread out her beautiful arms as if indeed she could fly off like the pretty gawrie whom the man in the story was enamored of <\s>
<s> and what will your peter wilkins say to your flight <\s>
<s> says esmond who never admired this fair creature more than when she rebelled and laughed at him <\s>
<s> a duchess knows her place says she with a laugh <\s>
<s> why i have a son already made for me and thirty years old my lord arran and four daughters <\s>
<s> how they will scold and what a rage they will be in when i come to take the head of the table <\s>
<s> but i give them only a month to be angry at the end of that time they shall love me every one and so shall lord arran and so shall all his grace's scots vassals and followers in the highlands <\s>
<s> i'm bent on it and when i take a thing in my head tis done <\s>
<s> his grace is the greatest gentleman in europe and i'll try and make him happy and when the king comes back you may count on my protection cousin esmond for come back the king will and shall and i'll bring him back from versailles if he comes under my hoop <\s>
<s> i hope the world will make you happy beatrix says esmond with a sigh <\s>
<s> you'll be beatrix till you are my lady duchess will you not <\s>
<s> i shall then make your grace my very lowest bow <\s>
<s> none of these sighs and this satire cousin she says <\s>
<s> i take his grace's great bounty thankfully yes thankfully and will wear his honors becomingly <\s>
<s> i do not say he hath touched my heart but he has my gratitude obedience admiration i have told him that and no more and with that his noble heart is content <\s>
<s> i have told him all even the story of that poor creature that i was engaged to and that i could not love and i gladly gave his word back to him and jumped for joy to get back my own <\s>
<s> i am twenty five years old <\s>
<s> twenty six my dear says esmond <\s>
