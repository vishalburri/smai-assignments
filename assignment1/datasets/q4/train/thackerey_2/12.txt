<s> the intimacy between the lords mohun and castlewood appeared to increase as long as the former remained in the country and my lord of castlewood especially seemed never to be happy out of his new comrade's sight <\s>
<s> they sported together they drank they played bowls and tennis my lord castlewood would go for three days to sark and bring back my lord mohun to castlewood where indeed his lordship made himself very welcome to all persons having a joke or a new game at romps for the children all the talk of the town for my lord and music and gallantry and plenty of the beau langage for my lady and for harry esmond who was never tired of hearing his stories of his campaigns and his life at vienna venice paris and the famous cities of europe which he had visited both in peace and war <\s>
<s> and he sang at my lady's harpsichord and played cards or backgammon or his new game of billiards with my lord of whom he invariably got the better always having a consummate good humor and bearing himself with a certain manly grace that might exhibit somewhat of the camp and alsatia perhaps but that had its charm and stamped him a gentleman and his manner to lady castlewood was so devoted and respectful that she soon recovered from the first feelings of dislike which she had conceived against him nay before long began to be interested in his spiritual welfare and hopeful of his conversion lending him books of piety which he promised dutifully to study <\s>
<s> with her my lord talked of reform of settling into quiet life quitting the court and town and buying some land in the neighborhood though it must be owned that when the two lords were together over their burgundy after dinner their talk was very different and there was very little question of conversion on my lord mohun's part <\s>
<s> when they got to their second bottle harry esmond used commonly to leave these two noble topers who though they talked freely enough heaven knows in his presence good lord what a set of stories of alsatia and spring garden of the taverns and gaming houses of the ladies of the court and mesdames of the theatres he can recall out of their godly conversation although i say they talked before esmond freely yet they seemed pleased when he went away and then they had another bottle and then they fell to cards and then my lord mohun came to her ladyship's drawing room leaving his boon companion to sleep off his wine <\s>
<s> twas a point of honor with the fine gentlemen of those days to lose or win magnificently at their horse matches or games of cards and dice and you could never tell from the demeanor of these two lords afterwards which had been successful and which the loser at their games <\s>

<s> a man of fashion of that time often passed a quarter of his day at cards and another quarter at drink i have known many a pretty fellow who was a wit too ready of repartee and possessed of a thousand graces who would be puzzled if he had to write more than his name <\s>

<s> and he sang at my lady's harpsichord and played cards or backgammon or his new game of billiards with my lord of whom he invariably got the better always having a consummate good humor and bearing himself with a certain manly grace that might exhibit somewhat of the camp and alsatia perhaps but that had its charm and stamped him a gentleman and his manner to lady castlewood was so devoted and respectful that she soon recovered from the first feelings of dislike which she had conceived against him nay before long began to be interested in his spiritual welfare and hopeful of his conversion lending him books of piety which he promised dutifully to study <\s>
<s> with her my lord talked of reform of settling into quiet life quitting the court and town and buying some land in the neighborhood though it must be owned that when the two lords were together over their burgundy after dinner their talk was very different and there was very little question of conversion on my lord mohun's part <\s>
<s> when they got to their second bottle harry esmond used commonly to leave these two noble topers who though they talked freely enough heaven knows in his presence good lord what a set of stories of alsatia and spring garden of the taverns and gaming houses of the ladies of the court and mesdames of the theatres he can recall out of their godly conversation although i say they talked before esmond freely yet they seemed pleased when he went away and then they had another bottle and then they fell to cards and then my lord mohun came to her ladyship's drawing room leaving his boon companion to sleep off his wine <\s>

<s> and he sang at my lady's harpsichord and played cards or backgammon or his new game of billiards with my lord of whom he invariably got the better always having a consummate good humor and bearing himself with a certain manly grace that might exhibit somewhat of the camp and alsatia perhaps but that had its charm and stamped him a gentleman and his manner to lady castlewood was so devoted and respectful that she soon recovered from the first feelings of dislike which she had conceived against him nay before long began to be interested in his spiritual welfare and hopeful of his conversion lending him books of piety which he promised dutifully to study <\s>
<s> with her my lord talked of reform of settling into quiet life quitting the court and town and buying some land in the neighborhood though it must be owned that when the two lords were together over their burgundy after dinner their talk was very different and there was very little question of conversion on my lord mohun's part <\s>
<s> when they got to their second bottle harry esmond used commonly to leave these two noble topers who though they talked freely enough heaven knows in his presence good lord what a set of stories of alsatia and spring garden of the taverns and gaming houses of the ladies of the court and mesdames of the theatres he can recall out of their godly conversation although i say they talked before esmond freely yet they seemed pleased when he went away and then they had another bottle and then they fell to cards and then my lord mohun came to her ladyship's drawing room leaving his boon companion to sleep off his wine <\s>
