<s> she took on sadly about her husband <\s>
<s> he has been buried to day and a many of the coaches of the nobility went with him my lord marlborough's and my lord sunderland's and many of the officers of the guards in which he served in the old king's time and my lady has been with her two children to the king at kensington and asked for justice against my lord mohun who is in hiding and my lord the earl of warwick and holland who is ready to give himself up and take his trial <\s>
<s> such were the news coupled with assertions about her own honesty and that of molly her maid who would never have stolen a certain trumpery gold sleeve button of mr <\s>
<s> esmond's that was missing after his fainting fit that the keeper's wife brought to her lodger <\s>
<s> his thoughts followed to that untimely grave the brave heart the kind friend the gallant gentleman honest of word and generous of thought if feeble of purpose but are his betters much stronger than he who had given him bread and shelter when he had none home and love when he needed them and who if he had kept one vital secret from him had done that of which he repented ere dying a wrong indeed but one followed by remorse and occasioned by almost irresistible temptation <\s>
<s> esmond took his handkerchief when his nurse left him and very likely kissed it and looked at the bauble embroidered in the corner <\s>
<s> it has cost thee grief enough he thought dear lady so loving and so tender <\s>
<s> shall i take it from thee and thy children <\s>
<s> keep it and wear it my little frank my pretty boy <\s>
<s> if i cannot make a name for myself i can die without one <\s>
<s> some day when my dear mistress sees my heart i shall be righted or if not here or now why elsewhere where honor doth not follow us but where love reigns perpetual <\s>
<s> tis needless to relate here as the reports of the lawyers already have chronicled them the particulars or issue of that trial which ensued upon my lord castlewood's melancholy homicide <\s>
<s> of the two lords engaged in that sad matter the second my lord the earl of warwick and holland who had been engaged with colonel westbury and wounded by him was found not guilty by his peers before whom he was tried under the presidence of the lord steward lord somers ); and the principal the lord mohun being found guilty of the manslaughter which indeed was forced upon him and of which he repented most sincerely pleaded his clergy and so was discharged without any penalty <\s>
<s> the widow of the slain nobleman as it was told us in prison showed an extraordinary spirit and though she had to wait for ten years before her son was old enough to compass it declared she would have revenge of her husband's murderer <\s>
<s> so much and suddenly had grief anger and misfortune appeared to change her <\s>
<s> but fortune good or ill as i take it does not change men and women <\s>
<s> it but develops their characters <\s>
<s> as there are a thousand thoughts lying within a man that he does not know till he takes up the pen to write so the heart is a secret even to him or her who has it in his own breast <\s>
<s> who hath not found himself surprised into revenge or action or passion for good or evil whereof the seeds lay within him latent and unsuspected until the occasion called them forth <\s>
<s> with the death of her lord a change seemed to come over the whole conduct and mind of lady castlewood but of this we shall speak in the right season and anon <\s>
<s> the lords being tried then before their peers at westminster according to their privilege being brought from the tower with state processions and barges and accompanied by lieutenants and axe men the commoners engaged in that melancholy fray took their trial at newgate as became them and being all found guilty pleaded likewise their benefit of clergy <\s>
<s> the sentence as we all know in these cases is that the culprit lies a year in prison or during the king's pleasure and is burned in the hand or only stamped with a cold iron or this part of the punishment is altogether remitted at the grace of the sovereign <\s>
<s> so harry esmond found himself a criminal and a prisoner at two and twenty years old as for the two colonels his comrades they took the matter very lightly <\s>
<s> duelling was a part of their business and they could not in honor refuse any invitations of that sort <\s>
<s> but the case was different with mr <\s>
<s> his life was changed by that stroke of the sword which destroyed his kind patron's <\s>
<s> as he lay in prison old dr <\s>
<s> tusher fell ill and died and lady castlewood appointed thomas tusher to the vacant living about the filling of which she had a thousand times fondly talked to harry esmond how they never should part how he should educate her boy how to be a country clergyman like saintly george herbert or pious dr <\s>
<s> ken was the happiest and greatest lot in life how if he were obstinately bent on it though for her part she owned rather to holding queen bess's opinion that a bishop should have no wife and if not a bishop why a clergyman she would find a good wife for harry esmond and so on with a hundred pretty prospects told by fireside evenings in fond prattle as the children played about the hall <\s>
<s> all these plans were overthrown now <\s>
<s> thomas tusher wrote to esmond as he lay in prison announcing that his patroness had conferred upon him the living his reverend father had held for many years that she never after the tragical events which had occurred whereof tom spoke with a very edifying horror could see in the revered tusher's pulpit or at her son's table the man who was answerable for the father's life that her ladyship bade him to say that she prayed for her kinsman's repentance and his worldly happiness that he was free to command her aid for any scheme of life which he might propose to himself but that on this side of the grave she would see him no more <\s>
<s> and tusher for his own part added that harry should have his prayers as a friend of his youth and commended him whilst he was in prison to read certain works of theology which his reverence pronounced to be very wholesome for sinners in his lamentable condition <\s>
<s> and this was the return for a life of devotion this the end of years of affectionate intercourse and passionate fidelity <\s>
<s> harry would have died for his patron and was held as little better than his murderer he had sacrificed she did not know how much for his mistress and she threw him aside he had endowed her family with all they had and she talked about giving him alms as to a menial <\s>
<s> the grief for his patron's loss the pains of his own present position and doubts as to the future all these were forgotten under the sense of the consummate outrage which he had to endure and overpowered by the superior pang of that torture <\s>
<s> he writ back a letter to mr <\s>
<s> tusher from his prison congratulating his reverence upon his appointment to the living of castlewood sarcastically bidding him to follow in the footsteps of his admirable father whose gown had descended upon him thanking her ladyship for her offer of alms which he said he should trust not to need and beseeching her to remember that if ever her determination should change towards him he would be ready to give her proofs of a fidelity which had never wavered and which ought never to have been questioned by that house <\s>
<s> and if we meet no more or only as strangers in this world mr <\s>
<s> esmond concluded a sentence against the cruelty and injustice of which i disdain to appeal hereafter she will know who was faithful to her and whether she had any cause to suspect the love and devotion of her kinsman and servant <\s>
<s> after the sending of this letter the poor young fellow's mind was more at ease than it had been previously <\s>
<s> the blow had been struck and he had borne it <\s>
<s> his cruel goddess had shaken her wings and fled and left him alone and friendless but virtute sua <\s>
<s> and he had to bear him up at once the sense of his right and the feeling of his wrongs his honor and his misfortune <\s>
<s> as i have seen men waking and running to arms at a sudden trumpet before emergency a manly heart leaps up resolute meets the threatening danger with undaunted countenance and whether conquered or conquering faces it always <\s>
<s> no man knows his strength or his weakness till occasion proves them <\s>
<s> if there be some thoughts and actions of his life from the memory of which a man shrinks with shame sure there are some which he may be proud to own and remember forgiven injuries conquered temptations now and then and difficulties vanquished by endurance <\s>
<s> it was these thoughts regarding the living far more than any great poignancy of grief respecting the dead which affected harry esmond whilst in prison after his trial but it may be imagined that he could take no comrade of misfortune into the confidence of his feelings and they thought it was remorse and sorrow for his patron's loss which affected the young man in error of which opinion he chose to leave them <\s>
<s> as a companion he was so moody and silent that the two officers his fellow sufferers left him to himself mostly liked little very likely what they knew of him consoled themselves with dice cards and the bottle and whiled away their own captivity in their own way <\s>
<s> it seemed to esmond as if he lived years in that prison and was changed and aged when he came out of it <\s>
<s> at certain periods of life we live years of emotion in a few weeks and look back on those times as on great gaps between the old life and the new <\s>
<s> you do not know how much you suffer in those critical maladies of the heart until the disease is over and you look back on it afterwards <\s>
<s> during the time the suffering is at least sufferable <\s>
<s> the day passes in more or less of pain and the night wears away somehow <\s>
<s> tis only in after days that we see what the danger has been as a man out a hunting or riding for his life looks at a leap and wonders how he should have survived the taking of it <\s>
<s> o dark months of grief and rage <\s>
<s> of wrong and cruel endurance <\s>
<s> he is old now who recalls you <\s>
<s> long ago he has forgiven and blest the soft hand that wounded him but the mark is there and the wound is cicatrized only no time tears caresses or repentance can obliterate the scar <\s>
<s> we are indocile to put up with grief however <\s>
<s> reficimus rates quassas we tempt the ocean again and again and try upon new ventures <\s>
<s> esmond thought of his early time as a novitiate and of this past trial as an initiation before entering into life as our young indians undergo tortures silently before they pass to the rank of warriors in the tribe <\s>
<s> the officers meanwhile who were not let into the secret of the grief which was gnawing at the side of their silent young friend and being accustomed to such transactions in which one comrade or another was daily paying the forfeit of the sword did not of course bemoan themselves very inconsolably about the fate of their late companion in arms <\s>
<s> this one told stories of former adventures of love or war or pleasure in which poor frank esmond had been engaged t'other recollected how a constable had been bilked or a tavern bully beaten whilst my lord's poor widow was sitting at his tomb worshipping him as an actual saint and spotless hero so the visitors said who had news of lady castlewood and westbury and macartney had pretty nearly had all the town to come and see them <\s>
<s> the duel its fatal termination the trial of the two peers and the three commoners concerned had caused the greatest excitement in the town <\s>
<s> the prints and news letters were full of them <\s>
<s> the three gentlemen in newgate were almost as much crowded as the bishops in the tower or a highwayman before execution <\s>
<s> we were allowed to live in the governor's house as hath been said both before trial and after condemnation waiting the king's pleasure nor was the real cause of the fatal quarrel known so closely had my lord and the two other persons who knew it kept the secret but every one imagined that the origin of the meeting was a gambling dispute <\s>
<s> except fresh air the prisoners had upon payment most things they could desire <\s>
<s> interest was made that they should not mix with the vulgar convicts whose ribald choruses and loud laughter and curses could be heard from their own part of the prison where they and the miserable debtors were confined pell mell <\s>
<s> i come to the end of my captivity but not of my trouble <\s>
<s> among the company which came to visit the two officers was an old acquaintance of harry esmond that gentleman of the guards namely who had been so kind to harry when captain westbury's troop had been quartered at castlewood more than seven years before <\s>
<s> dick the scholar was no longer dick the trooper now but captain steele of lucas's fusiliers and secretary to my lord cutts that famous officer of king william's the bravest and most beloved man of the english army <\s>
<s> the two jolly prisoners had been drinking with a party of friends for our cellar and that of the keepers of newgate too were supplied with endless hampers of burgundy and champagne that the friends of the colonels sent in ); and harry having no wish for their drink or their conversation being too feeble in health for the one and too sad in spirits for the other was sitting apart in his little room reading such books as he had one evening when honest colonel westbury flushed with liquor and always good humored in and out of his cups came laughing into harry's closet and said ho young killjoy <\s>
<s> here's a friend come to see thee he'll pray with thee or he'll drink with thee or he'll drink and pray turn about <\s>
<s> dick my christian hero here's the little scholar of castlewood <\s>
<s> dick came up and kissed esmond on both cheeks imparting a strong perfume of burnt sack along with his caress to the young man <\s>
<s> is this the little man that used to talk latin and fetch our bowls <\s>
<s> how tall thou art grown <\s>
<s> i protest i should have known thee anywhere <\s>
<s> and so you have turned ruffian and fighter and wanted to measure swords with mohun did you <\s>
<s> i protest that mohun said at the guard dinner yesterday where there was a pretty company of us that the young fellow wanted to fight him and was the better man of the two <\s>
<s> i wish we could have tried and proved it mr <\s>
<s> steele says esmond thinking of his dead benefactor and his eyes filling with tears <\s>
<s> with the exception of that one cruel letter which he had from his mistress mr <\s>
<s> esmond heard nothing from her and she seemed determined to execute her resolve of parting from him and disowning him <\s>
<s> but he had news of her such as it was which mr <\s>
<s> steele assiduously brought him from the prince's and princess's court where our honest captain had been advanced to the post of gentleman waiter <\s>
<s> when off duty there captain dick often came to console his friends in captivity a good nature and a friendly disposition towards all who were in ill fortune no doubt prompting him to make his visits and good fellowship and good wine to prolong them <\s>
<s> faith says westbury the little scholar was the first to begin the quarrel i mind me of it now at lockit's <\s>
<s> i always hated that fellow mohun <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the quarrel betwixt him and poor frank <\s>
<s> i would wager twas a woman <\s>
<s> twas a quarrel about play on my word about play harry said <\s>
<s> my poor lord lost great sums to his guest at castlewood <\s>
<s> angry words passed between them and though lord castlewood was the kindest and most pliable soul alive his spirit was very high and hence that meeting which has brought us all here says mr <\s>
<s> esmond resolved never to acknowledge that there had ever been any other cause but cards for the duel <\s>
<s> i do not like to use bad words of a nobleman says westbury but if my lord mohun were a commoner i would say twas a pity he was not hanged <\s>
<s> he was familiar with dice and women at a time other boys are at school being birched he was as wicked as the oldest rake years ere he had done growing and handled a sword and a foil and a bloody one too before he ever used a razor <\s>
<s> he held poor will mountford in talk that night when bloody dick hill ran him through <\s>
<s> he will come to a bad end will that young lord and no end is bad enough for him says honest mr <\s>
