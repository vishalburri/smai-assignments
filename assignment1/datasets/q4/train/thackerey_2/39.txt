<s> we knew that her pride was awfully humbled and punished by this sudden and terrible blow she wanted no teaching of ours to point out the sad moral of her story <\s>
<s> her fond mother could give but her prayers and her kinsman his faithful friendship and patience to the unhappy stricken creature and it was only by hints and a word or two uttered months afterwards that beatrix showed she understood their silent commiseration and on her part was secretly thankful for their forbearance <\s>
<s> the people about the court said there was that in her manner which frightened away scoffing and condolence she was above their triumph and their pity and acted her part in that dreadful tragedy greatly and courageously so that those who liked her least were yet forced to admire her <\s>
<s> we who watched her after her disaster could not but respect the indomitable courage and majestic calm with which she bore it <\s>
<s> i would rather see her tears than her pride her mother said who was accustomed to bear her sorrows in a very different way and to receive them as the stroke of god with an awful submission and meekness <\s>
<s> but beatrix's nature was different to that tender parent's she seemed to accept her grief and to defy it nor would she allow it i believe not even in private and in her own chamber to extort from her the confession of even a tear of humiliation or a cry of pain <\s>

<s> during that well founded panic the whigs had lest the queen should forsake their hanoverian prince bound by oaths and treaties as she was to him and recall her brother who was allied to her by yet stronger ties of nature and duty the prince of savoy and the boldest of that party of the whigs were for bringing the young duke of cambridge over in spite of the queen and the outcry of her tory servants arguing that the electoral prince a peer and prince of the blood royal of this realm too and in the line of succession to the crown had a right to sit in the parliament whereof he was a member and to dwell in the country which he one day was to govern <\s>

<s> an invader with an army of frenchmen behind him englishmen of spirit would resist to the death and drive back to the shores whence he came but a prince alone armed with his right only and relying on the loyalty of his people was sure many of his friends argued of welcome at least of safety among us <\s>

<s> esmond has no right to mention he found himself engaged the year after that miserable death of duke hamilton which deprived the prince of his most courageous ally in this country <\s>
<s> dean atterbury was one of the friends whom esmond may mention as the brave bishop is now beyond exile and persecution and to him and one or two more the colonel opened himself of a scheme of his own that backed by a little resolution on the prince's part could not fail of bringing about the accomplishment of their dearest wishes <\s>
<s> my young lord viscount castlewood had not come to england to keep his majority and had now been absent from the country for several years <\s>
<s> the year when his sister was to be married and duke hamilton died my lord was kept at bruxelles by his wife's lying in <\s>
<s> the gentle clotilda could not bear her husband out of her sight perhaps she mistrusted the young scapegrace should he ever get loose from her leading strings and she kept him by her side to nurse the baby and administer posset to the gossips <\s>
<s> many a laugh poor beatrix had had about frank's uxoriousness his mother would have gone to clotilda when her time was coming but that the mother in law was already in possession and the negotiations for poor beatrix's marriage were begun <\s>
<s> a few months after the horrid catastrophe in hyde park my mistress and her daughter retired to castlewood where my lord it was expected would soon join them <\s>

<s> the fond heart of his mother was pained by this long absence <\s>

<s> just as frank's poor mother had made all things ready for lord castlewood's reception and was eagerly expecting her son it was by colonel esmond's means that the kind lady was disappointed of her longing and obliged to defer once more the darling hope of her heart <\s>
<s> esmond took horses to castlewood <\s>
<s> he had not seen its ancient gray towers and well remembered woods for nearly fourteen years and since he rode thence with my lord to whom his mistress with her young children by her side waved an adieu <\s>
<s> what ages seemed to have passed since then what years of action and passion of care love hope disaster <\s>
<s> the children were grown up now and had stories of their own <\s>
<s> as for esmond he felt to be a hundred years old his dear mistress only seemed unchanged she looked and welcomed him quite as of old <\s>
<s> there was the fountain in the court babbling its familiar music the old hall and its furniture the carved chair my late lord used the very flagon he drank from <\s>

<s> esmond passed a part of that first night at castlewood lying awake for many hours as the clock kept tolling in tones so well remembered looking back as all men will that revisit their home of childhood over the great gulf of time and surveying himself on the distant bank yonder a sad little melancholy boy with his lord still alive his dear mistress a girl yet her children sporting around her <\s>
<s> years ago a boy on that very bed when she had blessed him and called him her knight he had made a vow to be faithful and never desert her dear service <\s>
<s> had he kept that fond boyish promise <\s>
<s> yes before heaven yes praise be to god <\s>
<s> his life had been hers his blood his fortune his name his whole heart ever since had been hers and her children's <\s>
<s> all night long he was dreaming his boyhood over again and waking fitfully he half fancied he heard father holt calling to him from the next chamber and that he was coming in and out of from the mysterious window <\s>
<s> esmond rose up before the dawn passed into the next room where the air was heavy with the odor of the wall flowers looked into the brazier where the papers had been burnt into the old presses where holt's books and papers had been kept and tried the spring and whether the window worked still <\s>
<s> the spring had not been touched for years but yielded at length and the whole fabric of the window sank down <\s>
<s> he lifted it and it relapsed into its frame no one had ever passed thence since holt used it sixteen years ago <\s>
<s> esmond remembered his poor lord saying on the last day of his life that holt used to come in and out of the house like a ghost and knew that the father liked these mysteries and practised such secret disguises entrances and exits this was the way the ghost came and went his pupil had always conjectured <\s>
<s> esmond closed the casement up again as the dawn was rising over castlewood village he could hear the clinking at the blacksmith's forge yonder among the trees across the green and past the river on which a mist still lay sleeping <\s>
<s> next esmond opened that long cupboard over the woodwork of the mantel piece big enough to hold a man and in which mr <\s>
<s> holt used to keep sundry secret properties of his <\s>
<s> the two swords he remembered so well as a boy lay actually there still and esmond took them out and wiped them with a strange curiosity of emotion <\s>
<s> there were a bundle of papers here too which no doubt had been left at holt's last visit to the place in my lord viscount's life that very day when the priest had been arrested and taken to hexham castle <\s>
<s> esmond made free with these papers and found treasonable matter of king william's reign the names of charnock and perkins sir john fenwick and sir john friend rookwood and lodwick lords montgomery and allesbury clarendon and yarmouth that had all been engaged in plots against the usurper a letter from the duke of berwick too and one from the king at st <\s>
<s> germains offering to confer upon his trusty and well beloved francis viscount castlewood the titles of earl and marquis of esmond bestowed by patent royal and in the fourth year of his reign upon thomas viscount castlewood and the heirs male of his body in default of which issue the ranks and dignities were to pass to francis aforesaid <\s>
<s> this was the paper whereof my lord had spoken which holt showed him the very day he was arrested and for an answer to which he would come back in a week's time <\s>
<s> i put these papers hastily into the crypt whence i had taken them being interrupted by a tapping of a light finger at the ring of the chamber door twas my kind mistress with her face full of love and welcome <\s>
<s> she too had passed the night wakefuly no doubt but neither asked the other how the hours had been spent <\s>
<s> there are things we divine without speaking and know though they happen out of our sight <\s>
<s> this fond lady hath told me that she knew both days when i was wounded abroad <\s>
<s> who shall say how far sympathy reaches and how truly love can prophesy <\s>
<s> i looked into your room was all she said the bed was vacant the little old bed <\s>
<s> i knew i should find you here <\s>
<s> and tender and blushing faintly with a benediction in her eyes the gentle creature kissed him <\s>
<s> they walked out hand in hand through the old court and to the terrace walk where the grass was glistening with dew and the birds in the green woods above were singing their delicious choruses under the blushing morning sky <\s>
<s> how well all things were remembered <\s>
<s> the ancient towers and gables of the hall darkling against the east the purple shadows on the green slopes the quaint devices and carvings of the dial the forest crowned heights the fair yellow plain cheerful with crops and corn the shining river rolling through it towards the pearly hills beyond all these were before us along with a thousand beautiful memories of our youth beautiful and sad but as real and vivid in our minds as that fair and always remembered scene our eyes beheld once more <\s>
<s> the memory sleeps but wakens again i often think how it shall be when after the last sleep of death the reveillee shall arouse us for ever and the past in one flash of self consciousness rush back like the soul revivified <\s>
<s> the house would not be up for some hours yet it was july and the dawn was only just awake and here esmond opened himself to his mistress of the business he had in hand and what part frank was to play in it <\s>
<s> he knew he could confide anything to her and that the fond soul would die rather than reveal it and bidding her keep the secret from all he laid it entirely before his mistress always as staunch a little loyalist as any in the kingdom and indeed was quite sure that any plan of his was secure of her applause and sympathy <\s>
<s> never was such a glorious scheme to her partial mind never such a devoted knight to execute it <\s>
<s> an hour or two may have passed whilst they were having their colloquy <\s>
<s> beatrix came out to them just as their talk was over her tall beautiful form robed in sable which she wore without ostentation ever since last year's catastrophe sweeping over the green terrace and casting its shadows before her across the grass <\s>
<s> she made us one of her grand curtsies smiling and called us the young people <\s>
<s> she was older paler and more majestic than in the year before her mother seemed the youngest of the two <\s>
<s> she never once spoke of her grief lady castlewood told esmond or alluded save by a quiet word or two to the death of her hopes <\s>
<s> when beatrix came back to castlewood she took to visiting all the cottages and all the sick <\s>
<s> she set up a school of children and taught singing to some of them <\s>
<s> we had a pair of beautiful old organs in castlewood church on which she played admirably so that the music there became to be known in the country for many miles round and no doubt people came to see the fair organist as well as to hear her <\s>
<s> parson tusher and his wife were established at the vicarage but his wife had brought him no children wherewith tom might meet his enemies at the gate <\s>
<s> honest tom took care not to have many such his great shovel hat was in his hand for everybody <\s>
<s> he was profuse of bows and compliments <\s>
<s> he behaved to esmond as if the colonel had been a commander in chief he dined at the hall that day being sunday and would not partake of pudding except under extreme pressure <\s>
<s> he deplored my lord's perversion but drank his lordship's health very devoutly and an hour before at church sent the colonel to sleep with a long learned and refreshing sermon <\s>
<s> esmond's visit home was but for two days the business he had in hand calling him away and out of the country <\s>
<s> ere he went he saw beatrix but once alone and then she summoned him out of the long tapestry room where he and his mistress were sitting quite as in old times into the adjoining chamber that had been viscountess isabel's sleeping apartment and where esmond perfectly well remembered seeing the old lady sitting up in the bed in her night rail that morning when the troop of guard came to fetch her <\s>
<s> the most beautiful woman in england lay in that bed now whereof the great damask hangings were scarce faded since esmond saw them last <\s>
<s> here stood beatrix in her black robes holding a box in her hand twas that which esmond had given her before her marriage stamped with a coronet which the disappointed girl was never to wear and containing his aunt's legacy of diamonds <\s>
<s> you had best take these with you harry says she i have no need of diamonds any more <\s>
