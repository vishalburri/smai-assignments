<s> at least if women are slaves there no one sees them answered the lady <\s>
<s> they don't work in street gangs with the public to jeer them and if they suffer suffer in private <\s>
<s> here comes my lord home from hunting <\s>
<s> take away the books <\s>
<s> my lord does not love to see them <\s>
<s> lessons are over for to day mr <\s>
<s> and with a curtsy and a smile she would end this sort of colloquy <\s>
<s> tutor as my lady called esmond had now business enough on his hands in castlewood house <\s>
<s> he had three pupils his lady and her two children at whose lessons she would always be present besides writing my lord's letters and arranging his accompts for him when these could be got from esmond's indolent patron <\s>
<s> of the pupils the two young people were but lazy scholars and as my lady would admit no discipline such as was then in use my lord's son only learned what he liked which was but little and never to his life's end could be got to construe more than six lines of virgil <\s>
<s> mistress beatrix chattered french prettily from a very early age and sang sweetly but this was from her mother's teaching not harry esmond's who could scarce distinguish between green sleeves and lillibullero although he had no greater delight in life than to hear the ladies sing <\s>
<s> he sees them now will he ever forget them as they used to sit together of the summer evenings the two golden heads over the page the child's little hand and the mother's beating the time with their voices rising and falling in unison <\s>
<s> but if the children were careless twas a wonder how eagerly the mother learnt from her young tutor and taught him too <\s>
<s> the happiest instinctive faculty was this lady's a faculty for discerning latent beauties and hidden graces of books especially books of poetry as in a walk she would spy out field flowers and make posies of them such as no other hand could <\s>
<s> she was a critic not by reason but by feeling the sweetest commentator of those books they read together and the happiest hours of young esmond's life perhaps were those passed in the company of this kind mistress and her children <\s>
<s> these happy days were to end soon however and it was by the lady castlewood's own decree that they were brought to a conclusion <\s>
<s> it happened about christmas time harry esmond being now past sixteen years of age that his old comrade adversary and friend tom tusher returned from his school in london a fair well grown and sturdy lad who was about to enter college with an exhibition from his school and a prospect of after promotion in the church <\s>
<s> tom tusher's talk was of nothing but cambridge now and the boys who were good friends examined each other eagerly about their progress in books <\s>
<s> tom had learned some greek and hebrew besides latin in which he was pretty well skilled and also had given himself to mathematical studies under his father's guidance who was a proficient in those sciences of which esmond knew nothing nor could he write latin so well as tom though he could talk it better having been taught by his dear friend the jesuit father for whose memory the lad ever retained the warmest affection reading his books keeping his swords clean in the little crypt where the father had shown them to esmond on the night of his visit and often of a night sitting in the chaplain's room which he inhabited over his books his verses and rubbish with which the lad occupied himself he would look up at the window thinking he wished it might open and let in the good father <\s>
<s> he had come and passed away like a dream but for the swords and books harry might almost think the father was an imagination of his mind and for two letters which had come to him one from abroad full of advice and affection another soon after he had been confirmed by the bishop of hexton in which father holt deplored his falling away <\s>
<s> but harry esmond felt so confident now of his being in the right and of his own powers as a casuist that he thought he was able to face the father himself in argument and possibly convert him <\s>
<s> to work upon the faith of her young pupil esmond's kind mistress sent to the library of her father the dean who had been distinguished in the disputes of the late king's reign and an old soldier now had hung up his weapons of controversy <\s>
<s> these he took down from his shelves willingly for young esmond whom he benefited by his own personal advice and instruction <\s>
<s> it did not require much persuasion to induce the boy to worship with his beloved mistress <\s>
<s> and the good old nonjuring dean flattered himself with a conversion which in truth was owing to a much gentler and fairer persuader <\s>
<s> under her ladyship's kind eyes my lord's being sealed in sleep pretty generally esmond read many volumes of the works of the famous british divines of the last age and was familiar with wake and sherlock with stillingfleet and patrick <\s>
<s> his mistress never tired to listen or to read to pursue the texts with fond comments to urge those points which her fancy dwelt on most or her reason deemed most important <\s>
<s> since the death of her father the dean this lady hath admitted a certain latitude of theological reading which her orthodox father would never have allowed his favorite writers appealing more to reason and antiquity than to the passions or imaginations of their readers so that the works of bishop taylor nay those of mr <\s>
<s> law have in reality found more favor with my lady castlewood than the severer volumes of our great english schoolmen <\s>
<s> in later life at the university esmond reopened the controversy and pursued it in a very different manner when his patrons had determined for him that he was to embrace the ecclesiastical life <\s>
<s> but though his mistress's heart was in this calling his own never was much <\s>
<s> after that first fervor of simple devotion which his beloved jesuit priest had inspired in him speculative theology took but little hold upon the young man's mind <\s>
<s> when his early credulity was disturbed and his saints and virgins taken out of his worship to rank little higher than the divinities of olympus his belief became acquiescence rather than ardor and he made his mind up to assume the cassock and bands as another man does to wear a breastplate and jack boots or to mount a merchant's desk for a livelihood and from obedience and necessity rather than from choice <\s>
<s> there were scores of such men in mr <\s>
<s> esmond's time at the universities who were going to the church with no better calling than his <\s>
<s> when thomas tusher was gone a feeling of no small depression and disquiet fell upon young esmond of which though he did not complain his kind mistress must have divined the cause for soon after she showed not only that she understood the reason of harry's melancholy but could provide a remedy for it <\s>
<s> her habit was thus to watch unobservedly those to whom duty or affection bound her and to prevent their designs or to fulfil them when she had the power <\s>
<s> it was this lady's disposition to think kindnesses and devise silent bounties and to scheme benevolence for those about her <\s>
<s> we take such goodness for the most part as if it was our due the marys who bring ointment for our feet get but little thanks <\s>
<s> some of us never feel this devotion at all or are moved by it to gratitude or acknowledgment others only recall it years after when the days are past in which those sweet kindnesses were spent on us and we offer back our return for the debt by a poor tardy payment of tears <\s>
<s> then forgotten tones of love recur to us and kind glances shine out of the past oh so bright and clear oh so longed after because they are out of reach as holiday music from withinside a prison wall or sunshine seen through the bars more prized because unattainable more bright because of the contrast of present darkness and solitude whence there is no escape <\s>
<s> all the notice then which lady castlewood seemed to take of harry esmond's melancholy upon tom tusher's departure was by a gayety unusual to her to attempt to dispel his gloom <\s>
<s> she made his three scholars herself being the chief one more cheerful than ever they had been before and more docile too all of them learning and reading much more than they had been accustomed to do <\s>
<s> for who knows said the lady what may happen and whether we may be able to keep such a learned tutor long <\s>
<s> frank esmond said he for his part did not want to learn any more and cousin harry might shut up his book whenever he liked if he would come out a fishing and little beatrix declared she would send for tom tusher and he would be glad enough to come to castlewood if harry chose to go away <\s>
<s> at last comes a messenger from winchester one day bearer of a letter with a great black seal from the dean there to say that his sister was dead and had left her fortune of 2,000 l <\s>
<s> among her six nieces the dean's daughters and many a time since has harry esmond recalled the flushed face and eager look wherewith after this intelligence his kind lady regarded him <\s>
<s> she did not pretend to any grief about the deceased relative from whom she and her family had been many years parted <\s>
<s> when my lord heard of the news he also did not make any very long face <\s>
<s> the money will come very handy to furnish the music room and the cellar which is getting low and buy your ladyship a coach and a couple of horses that will do indifferent to ride or for the coach <\s>
<s> and beatrix you shall have a spinnet and frank you shall have a little horse from hexton fair and harry you shall have five pounds to buy some books said my lord who was generous with his own and indeed with other folk's money <\s>
<s> i wish your aunt would die once a year rachel we could spend your money and all your sisters too <\s>
<s> i have but one aunt and and i have another use for the money my lord says my lady turning very red <\s>
<s> another use my dear and what do you know about money <\s>
<s> and what the devil is there that i don't give you which you want <\s>
<s> i intend to give this money can't you fancy how my lord <\s>
<s> my lord swore one of his large oaths that he did not know in the least what she meant <\s>
<s> i intend it for harry esmond to go to college <\s>
<s> cousin harry says my lady you mustn't stay longer in this dull place but make a name to yourself and for us too harry <\s>
<s> d n it harry's well enough here says my lord for a moment looking rather sulky <\s>
<s> is harry going away <\s>
<s> you don't mean to say you will go away <\s>
<s> cry out frank and beatrix at one breath <\s>
<s> but he will come back and this will always be his home cries my lady with blue eyes looking a celestial kindness and his scholars will always love him won't they <\s>
<s> by g d rachel you're a good woman <\s>
<s> says my lord seizing my lady's hand at which she blushed very much and shrank back putting her children before her <\s>
<s> i wish you joy my kinsman he continued giving harry esmond a hearty slap on the shoulder <\s>
<s> i won't balk your luck <\s>
<s> go to cambridge boy and when tusher dies you shall have the living here if you are not better provided by that time <\s>
<s> we'll furnish the dining room and buy the horses another year <\s>
<s> i'll give thee a nag out of the stable take any one except my hack and the bay gelding and the coach horses and god speed thee my boy <\s>
<s> have the sorrel harry tis a good one <\s>
<s> father says tis the best in the stable says little frank clapping his hands and jumping up <\s>
<s> let's come and see him in the stable <\s>
<s> and the other in his delight and eagerness was for leaving the room that instant to arrange about his journey <\s>
<s> the lady castlewood looked after him with sad penetrating glances <\s>
<s> he wishes to be gone already my lord said she to her husband <\s>
<s> the young man hung back abashed <\s>
<s> indeed i would stay for ever if your ladyship bade me he said <\s>
<s> and thou wouldst be a fool for thy pains kinsman said my lord <\s>
<s> go and see the world <\s>
<s> sow thy wild oats and take the best luck that fate sends thee <\s>
<s> i wish i were a boy again that i might go to college and taste the trumpington ale <\s>
<s> ours indeed is but a dull home cries my lady with a little of sadness and maybe of satire in her voice an old glum house half ruined and the rest only half furnished a woman and two children are but poor company for men that are accustomed to better <\s>
<s> we are only fit to be your worship's handmaids and your pleasures must of necessity lie elsewhere than at home <\s>
<s> curse me rachel if i know now whether thou art in earnest or not said my lord <\s>
<s> in earnest my lord <\s>
<s> says she still clinging by one of her children <\s>
<s> is there much subject here for joke <\s>
<s> and she made him a grand curtsy and giving a stately look to harry esmond which seemed to say remember you understand me though he does not she left the room with her children <\s>
<s> since she found out that confounded hexton business my lord said and be hanged to them that told her she has not been the same woman <\s>
<s> she who used to be as humble as a milkmaid is as proud as a princess says my lord <\s>
<s> take my counsel harry esmond and keep clear of women <\s>
<s> since i have had anything to do with the jades they have given me nothing but disgust <\s>
<s> i had a wife at tangier with whom as she couldn't speak a word of my language you'd have thought i might lead a quiet life <\s>
<s> but she tried to poison me because she was jealous of a jew girl <\s>
<s> there was your aunt for aunt she is aunt jezebel a pretty life your father led with her <\s>
<s> and here's my lady <\s>
<s> when i saw her on a pillion riding behind the dean her father she looked and was such a baby that a sixpenny doll might have pleased her <\s>
<s> and now you see what she is hands off highty tighty high and mighty an empress couldn't be grander <\s>
