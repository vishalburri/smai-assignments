<s> we do not say you are too free with his majesty <\s>

<s> and again she looked towards the colonel <\s>
<s> we all felt a shock as she uttered those two or three french words her manner was exactly imitated from that of our foreign guest <\s>
<s> you had not learned to speak french a month ago beatrix says her mother sadly nor to speak ill of your father <\s>

<s> if you respected your mother a little more frank said trix you would do yourself no hurt <\s>
<s> i am no child says she turning round on him we have lived very well these five years without the benefit of your advice or example and i intend to take neither now <\s>
<s> why does not the head of the house speak <\s>

<s> when his chaplain has done singing the psalms will his lordship deliver the sermon <\s>

<s> you show yourself a very apt scholar madam says the colonel and turning to his mistress did your guest use these words in your ladyship's hearing or was it to beatrix in private that he was pleased to impart his opinion regarding my tiresome sermon <\s>
<s> have you seen him alone <\s>
<s> cries my lord starting up with an oath by god have you seen him alone <\s>
<s> were he here you wouldn't dare so to insult me no you would not dare <\s>
<s> keep your oaths my lord for your wife we are not used here to such language <\s>
<s> till you came there used to be kindness between me and mamma and i cared for her when you never did when you were away for years with your horses and your mistress and your popish wife <\s>
<s> by says my lord rapping out another oath clotilda is an angel how dare you say a word against clotilda <\s>
<s> colonel esmond could not refrain from a smile to see how easy frank's attack was drawn off by that feint i fancy clotilda is not the subject in hand says mr <\s>
<s> esmond rather scornfully her ladyship is at paris a hundred leagues off preparing baby linen <\s>
<s> it is about my lord castlewood's sister and not his wife the question is <\s>
<s> he is not my lord castlewood says beatrix and he knows he is not he is colonel francis esmond's son and no more and he wears a false title and he lives on another man's land and he knows it <\s>
<s> here was another desperate sally of the poor beleaguered garrison and an alerte in another quarter <\s>
<s> again i beg your pardon says esmond <\s>
<s> if there are no proofs of my claim i have no claim <\s>
<s> if my father acknowledged no heir yours was his lawful successor and my lord castlewood hath as good a right to his rank and small estate as any man in england <\s>
<s> but that again is not the question as you know very well let us bring our talk back to it as you will have me meddle in it <\s>
<s> the quarrels of her ministers before her face at the council board the pricks of conscience very likely the importunities of her ministers and constant turmoil and agitation round about her had weakened and irritated the princess extremely her strength was giving way under these continual trials of her temper and from day to day it was expected she must come to a speedy end of them <\s>
<s> just before viscount castlewood and his companion came from france her majesty was taken ill <\s>
<s> anthony's fire broke out on the royal legs there was no hurry for the presentation of the young lord at court or that person who should appear under his name and my lord viscount's wound breaking out opportunely he was kept conveniently in his chamber until such time as his physician would allow him to bend his knee before the queen <\s>
<s> at the commencement of july that influential lady with whom it has been mentioned that our party had relations came frequently to visit her young friend the maid of honor at kensington and my lord viscount the real or supposititious who was an invalid at lady castlewood's house <\s>
<s> on the 27th day of july the lady in question who held the most intimate post about the queen came in her chair from the palace hard by bringing to the little party in kensington square intelligence of the very highest importance <\s>
<s> the final blow had been struck and my lord of oxford and mortimer was no longer treasurer <\s>
<s> the staff was as yet given to no successor though my lord bolingbroke would undoubtedly be the man <\s>
<s> and now the time was come the queen's abigail said and now my lord castlewood ought to be presented to the sovereign <\s>
<s> after that scene which lord castlewood witnessed and described to his cousin who passed such a miserable night of mortification and jealousy as he thought over the transaction no doubt the three persons who were set by nature as protectors over beatrix came to the same conclusion that she must be removed from the presence of a man whose desires towards her were expressed only too clearly and who was no more scrupulous in seeking to gratify them than his father had been before him <\s>
<s> i suppose esmond's mistress her son and the colonel himself had been all secretly debating this matter in their minds for when frank broke out in his blunt way with i think beatrix had best be anywhere but here lady castlewood said i thank you frank i have thought so too and mr <\s>
<s> esmond though he only remarked that it was not for him to speak showed plainly by the delight on his countenance how very agreeable that proposal was to him <\s>
<s> one sees that you think with us henry says the viscountess with ever so little of sarcasm in her tone beatrix is best out of this house whilst we have our guest in it and as soon as this morning's business is done she ought to quit london <\s>
<s> asked colonel esmond not knowing what had been arranged though in fact the stroke next in importance to that of bringing the prince and of having him acknowledged by the queen was now being performed at the very moment we three were conversing together <\s>
<s> the court lady with whom our plan was concerted and who was a chief agent in it the court physician and the bishop of rochester who were the other two most active participators in our plan had held many councils in our house at kensington and elsewhere as to the means best to be adopted for presenting our young adventurer to his sister the queen <\s>
<s> the simple and easy plan proposed by colonel esmond had been agreed to by all parties which was that on some rather private day when there were not many persons about the court the prince should appear there as my lord castlewood should be greeted by his sister in waiting and led by that other lady into the closet of the queen <\s>
<s> and according to her majesty's health or humor and the circumstances that might arise during the interview it was to be left to the discretion of those present at it and to the prince himself whether he should declare that it was the queen's own brother or the brother of beatrix esmond who kissed her royal hand <\s>
<s> and this plan being determined on we were all waiting in very much anxiety for the day and signal of execution <\s>
<s> two mornings after that supper it being the 27th day of july the bishop of rochester breakfasting with lady castlewood and her family and the meal scarce over doctor a s coach drove up to our house at kensington and the doctor appeared amongst the party there enlivening a rather gloomy company for the mother and daughter had had words in the morning in respect to the transactions of that supper and other adventures perhaps and on the day succeeding <\s>
<s> beatrix's haughty spirit brooked remonstrances from no superior much less from her mother the gentlest of creatures whom the girl commanded rather than obeyed <\s>
<s> and feeling she was wrong and that by a thousand coquetries which she could no more help exercising on every man that came near her than the sun can help shining on great and small she had provoked the prince's dangerous admiration and allured him to the expression of it she was only the more wilful and imperious the more she felt her error <\s>
<s> to this party the prince being served with chocolate in his bedchamber where he lay late sleeping away the fumes of his wine the doctor came and by the urgent and startling nature of his news dissipated instantly that private and minor unpleasantry under which the family of castlewood was laboring <\s>
<s> he asked for the guest the guest was above in his own apartment he bade monsieur baptiste go up to his master instantly and requested that my lord viscount castlewood would straightway put his uniform on and come away in the doctor's coach now at the door <\s>
<s> he then informed madam beatrix what her part of the comedy was to be in half an hour says he her majesty and her favorite lady will take the air in the cedar walk behind the new banqueting house <\s>
<s> her majesty will be drawn in a garden chair madam beatrix esmond and her brother my lord viscount castlewood will be walking in the private garden here is lady masham's key and will come unawares upon the royal party <\s>
<s> the man that draws the chair will retire and leave the queen the favorite and the maid of honor and her brother together mistress beatrix will present her brother and then and then my lord bishop will pray for the result of the interview and his scots clerk will say amen <\s>
<s> quick put on your hood madam beatrix why doth not his majesty come down <\s>
<s> such another chance may not present itself for months again <\s>
<s> the prince was late and lazy and indeed had all but lost that chance through his indolence <\s>
