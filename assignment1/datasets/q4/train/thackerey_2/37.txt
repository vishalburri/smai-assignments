<s> there was one comrade of esmond's an honest little irish lieutenant of handyside's who owed so much money to a camp sutler that he began to make love to the man's daughter intending to pay his debt that way and at the battle of malplaquet flying away from the debt and lady too he rushed so desperately on the french lines that he got his company and came a captain out of the action and had to marry the sutler's daughter after all who brought him his cancelled debt to her father as poor roger's fortune <\s>
<s> to run out of the reach of bill and marriage he ran on the enemy's pikes and as these did not kill him he was thrown back upon t'other horn of his dilemma <\s>
<s> our great duke at the same battle was fighting not the french but the tories in england and risking his life and the army's not for his country but for his pay and places and for fear of his wife at home that only being in life whom he dreaded <\s>
<s> i have asked about men in my own company new drafts of poor country boys were perpetually coming over to us during the wars and brought from the ploughshare to the sword and found that a half of them under the flags were driven thither on account of a woman one fellow was jilted by his mistress and took the shilling in despair another jilted the girl and fled from her and the parish to the tents where the law could not disturb him <\s>
<s> why go on particularizing <\s>
<s> what can the sons of adam and eve expect but to continue in that course of love and trouble their father and mother set out on <\s>
<s> i am drawing nigh to the end of that period of my history when i was acquainted with the great world of england and europe my years are past the hebrew poet's limit and i say unto thee all my troubles and joys too for that matter have come from a woman as thine will when thy destined course begins <\s>
<s> twas a woman that made a soldier of me that set me intriguing afterwards i believe i would have spun smocks for her had she so bidden me what strength i had in my head i would have given her hath not every man in his degree had his omphale and delilah <\s>
<s> mine befooled me on the banks of the thames and in dear old england thou mayest find thine own by rappahannock <\s>
<s> to please that woman then i tried to distinguish myself as a soldier and afterwards as a wit and a politician as to please another i would have put on a black cassock and a pair of bands and had done so but that a superior fate intervened to defeat that project <\s>
<s> and i say i think the world is like captain esmond's company i spoke of anon and could you see every man's career in life you would find a woman clogging him or clinging round his march and stopping him or cheering him and goading him or beckoning him out of her chariot so that he goes up to her and leaves the race to be run without him or bringing him the apple and saying eat or fetching him the daggers and whispering kill <\s>
<s> yonder lies duncan and a crown and an opportunity <\s>
<s> your grandfather fought with more effect as a politician than as a wit and having private animosities and grievances of his own and his general's against the great duke in command of the army and more information on military matters than most writers who had never seen beyond the fire of a tobacco pipe at wills's he was enabled to do good service for that cause which he embarked in and for mr <\s>
<s> john and his party <\s>
<s> but he disdained the abuse in which some of the tory writers indulged for instance dr <\s>
<s> swift who actually chose to doubt the duke of marlborough's courage and was pleased to hint that his grace's military capacity was doubtful nor were esmond's performances worse for the effect they were intended to produce though no doubt they could not injure the duke of marlborough nearly so much in the public eyes as the malignant attacks of swift did which were carefully directed so as to blacken and degrade him because they were writ openly and fairly by mr <\s>
<s> esmond who made no disguise of them who was now out of the army and who never attacked the prodigious courage and talents only the selfishness and rapacity of the chief <\s>
<s> the colonel then having writ a paper for one of the tory journals called the post boy a letter upon bouchain that the town talked about for two whole days when the appearance of an italian singer supplied a fresh subject for conversation and having business at the exchange where mistress beatrix wanted a pair of gloves or a fan very likely esmond went to correct his paper and was sitting at the printer's when the famous doctor swift came in his irish fellow with him that used to walk before his chair and bawled out his master's name with great dignity <\s>
<s> esmond was waiting for the printer too whose wife had gone to the tavern to fetch him and was meantime engaged in drawing a picture of a soldier on horseback for a dirty little pretty boy of the printer's wife whom she had left behind her <\s>
<s> i presume you are the editor of the post boy sir <\s>
<s> says the doctor in a grating voice that had an irish twang and he looked at the colonel from under his two bushy eyebrows with a pair of very clear blue eyes <\s>
<s> his complexion was muddy his figure rather fat his chin double <\s>
<s> he wore a shabby cassock and a shabby hat over his black wig and he pulled out a great gold watch at which he looks very fierce <\s>
<s> i am but a contributor doctor swift says esmond with the little boy still on his knee <\s>
<s> he was sitting with his back in the window so that the doctor could not see him <\s>
<s> who told you i was dr <\s>
<s> says the doctor eying the other very haughtily <\s>
<s> your reverence's valet bawled out your name says the colonel <\s>
<s> i should judge you brought him from ireland <\s>
<s> and pray sir what right have you to judge whether my servant came from ireland or no <\s>
<s> i want to speak with your employer mr <\s>
<s> i'll thank ye go fetch him <\s>
<s> where's your papa tommy <\s>
<s> asks the colonel of the child a smutty little wretch in a frock <\s>
<s> instead of answering the child begins to cry the doctor's appearance had no doubt frightened the poor little imp <\s>
<s> send that squalling little brat about his business and do what i bid ye sir says the doctor <\s>
<s> i must finish the picture first for tommy says the colonel laughing <\s>
<s> here tommy will you have your pandour with whiskers or without <\s>
<s> whisters says tommy quite intent on the picture <\s>
<s> who the devil are ye sir <\s>
<s> cries the doctor are ye a printer's man or are ye not <\s>
