<s> or friar bacon who invented gunpowder and set the thames on fire <\s>
<s> swift turned quite red almost purple <\s>
<s> i did not intend any offence sir says he <\s>
<s> i dare say sir you offended without meaning says the other dryly <\s>
<s> who are ye sir <\s>

<s> you are one of the pack of grub street scribblers that my friend mr <\s>

<s> how dare ye sir speak to me in this tone <\s>
<s> cries the doctor in a great fume <\s>
<s> i beg your honor's humble pardon if i have offended your honor says esmond in a tone of great humility <\s>
<s> rather than be sent to the compter or be put in the pillory there's nothing i wouldn't do <\s>
<s> leach the printer's lady told me to mind tommy whilst she went for her husband to the tavern and i daren't leave the child lest he should fall into the fire but if your reverence will hold him i take the little beast <\s>
<s> says the doctor starting back <\s>
<s> i am engaged to your betters fellow <\s>
<s> leach that when he makes an appointment with dr <\s>
<s> swift he had best keep it do ye hear <\s>
<s> and keep a respectful tongue in your head sir when you address a person like me <\s>
<s> i'm but a poor broken down soldier says the colonel and i've seen better days though i am forced now to turn my hand to writing <\s>
<s> we can't help our fate sir <\s>
<s> you're the person that mr <\s>
<s> leach hath spoken to me of i presume <\s>
<s> have the goodness to speak civilly when you are spoken to and tell leach to call at my lodgings in bury street and bring the papers with him to night at ten o'clock <\s>
<s> and the next time you see me you'll know me and be civil mr <\s>
<s> poor kemp who had been a lieutenant at the beginning of the war and fallen into misfortune was the writer of the post boy and now took honest mr <\s>
<s> leach's pay in place of her majesty's <\s>
<s> esmond had seen this gentleman and a very ingenious hardworking honest fellow he was toiling to give bread to a great family and watching up many a long winter night to keep the wolf from his door <\s>
<s> john who had liberty always on his tongue had just sent a dozen of the opposition writers into prison and one actually into the pillory for what he called libels but libels not half so violent as those writ on our side <\s>
<s> with regard to this very piece of tyranny esmond had remonstrated strongly with the secretary who laughed and said the rascals were served quite right and told esmond a joke of swift's regarding the matter <\s>
<s> nay more this irishman when st <\s>
<s> john was about to pardon a poor wretch condemned to death for rape absolutely prevented the secretary from exercising this act of good nature and boasted that he had had the man hanged and great as the doctor's genius might be and splendid his ability esmond for one would affect no love for him and never desired to make his acquaintance <\s>
<s> the doctor was at court every sunday assiduously enough a place the colonel frequented but rarely though he had a great inducement to go there in the person of a fair maid of honor of her majesty's and the airs and patronage mr <\s>
<s> swift gave himself forgetting gentlemen of his country whom he knew perfectly his loud talk at once insolent and servile nay perhaps his very intimacy with lord treasurer and the secretary who indulged all his freaks and called him jonathan you may be sure were remarked by many a person of whom the proud priest himself took no note during that time of his vanity and triumph <\s>
<s> twas but three days after the 15th of november 1712 esmond minds him well of the date that he went by invitation to dine with his general the foot of whose table he used to take on these festive occasions as he had done at many a board hard and plentiful during the campaign <\s>
<s> this was a great feast and of the latter sort the honest old gentleman loved to treat his friends splendidly his grace of ormonde before he joined his army as generalissimo my lord viscount bolingbroke one of her majesty's secretaries of state my lord orkney that had served with us abroad being of the party <\s>
<s> his grace of hamilton master of the ordnance and in whose honor the feast had been given upon his approaching departure as ambassador to paris had sent an excuse to general webb at two o'clock but an hour before the dinner nothing but the most immediate business his grace said should have prevented him having the pleasure of drinking a parting glass to the health of general webb <\s>
<s> his absence disappointed esmond's old chief who suffered much from his wounds besides and though the company was grand it was rather gloomy <\s>
<s> john came last and brought a friend with him i'm sure says my general bowing very politely my table hath always a place for dr <\s>
<s> esmond went up to the doctor with a bow and a smile i gave dr <\s>
<s> swift's message says he to the printer i hope he brought your pamphlet to your lodgings in time <\s>
<s> indeed poor leach had come to his house very soon after the doctor left it being brought away rather tipsy from the tavern by his thrifty wife and he talked of cousin swift in a maudlin way though of course mr <\s>
<s> esmond did not allude to this relationship <\s>
<s> the doctor scowled blushed and was much confused and said scarce a word during the whole of dinner <\s>
<s> a very little stone will sometimes knock down these goliaths of wit and this one was often discomfited when met by a man of any spirit he took his place sulkily put water in his wine that the others drank plentifully and scarce said a word <\s>
<s> the talk was about the affairs of the day or rather about persons than affairs my lady marlborough's fury her daughters in old clothes and mob caps looking out from their windows and seeing the company pass to the drawing room the gentleman usher's horror when the prince of savoy was introduced to her majesty in a tie wig no man out of a full bottomed periwig ever having kissed the royal hand before about the mohawks and the damage they were doing rushing through the town killing and murdering <\s>
<s> some one said the ill omened face of mohun had been seen at the theatre the night before and macartney and meredith with him <\s>
<s> meant to be a feast the meeting in spite of drink and talk was as dismal as a funeral <\s>
<s> every topic started subsided into gloom <\s>
<s> his grace of ormonde went away because the conversation got upon denain where we had been defeated in the last campaign <\s>
<s> esmond's general was affected at the allusion to this action too for his comrade of wynendael the count of nassau woudenbourg had been slain there <\s>
<s> swift when esmond pledged him said he drank no wine and took his hat from the peg and went away beckoning my lord bolingbroke to follow him but the other bade him take his chariot and save his coach hire he had to speak with colonel esmond and when the rest of the company withdrew to cards these two remained behind in the dark <\s>
<s> bolingbroke always spoke freely when he had drunk freely <\s>
<s> his enemies could get any secret out of him in that condition women were even employed to ply him and take his words down <\s>
<s> i have heard that my lord stair three years after when the secretary fled to france and became the pretender's minister got all the information he wanted by putting female spies over st <\s>
<s> john in his cups <\s>
<s> he spoke freely now jonathan knows nothing of this for certain though he suspects it and by george webb will take an archbishopric and jonathan a no damme jonathan will take an arch bishopric from james i warrant me gladly enough <\s>
<s> your duke hath the string of the whole matter in his hand the secretary went on <\s>
<s> we have that which will force marlborough to keep his distance and he goes out of london in a fortnight <\s>
