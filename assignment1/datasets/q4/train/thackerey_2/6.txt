<s> far be it from me to do so cried the doctor <\s>
<s> heaven grant i may be mistaken in the girl and in you sir who have a truly precocious genius but that is not the point at issue at present <\s>
<s> it appears that the small pox broke out in the little boy at the three castles that it was on him when you visited the ale house for your own reasons and that you sat with the child for some time and immediately afterwards with my young lord <\s>

<s> this is all very true sir said lady esmond looking at the young man <\s>

<s> there is no use my lord she said frank was on his knee as he was making pictures and was running constantly from henry to me <\s>
<s> the evil is done if any <\s>
<s> not with me damme cried my lord <\s>
<s> i've been smoking and he lighted his pipe again with a coal and it keeps off infection and as the disease is in the village plague take it i would have you leave it <\s>
<s> we'll go to morrow to walcote my lady <\s>
<s> i have no fear said my lady i may have had it as an infant it broke out in our house then and when four of my sisters had it at home two years before our marriage i escaped it and two of my dear sisters died <\s>
<s> i won't run the risk said my lord i'm as bold as any man but i'll not bear that <\s>
<s> take beatrix with you and go said my lady <\s>
<s> for us the mischief is done and tucker can wait upon us who has had the disease <\s>
<s> you take care to choose em ugly enough said my lord at which her ladyship hung down her head and looked foolish and my lord calling away tusher bade him come to the oak parlor and have a pipe <\s>
<s> the doctor made a low bow to her ladyship of which salaams he was profuse and walked off on his creaking square toes after his patron <\s>
<s> when the lady and the young man were alone there was a silence of some moments during which he stood at the fire looking rather vacantly at the dying embers whilst her ladyship busied herself with the tambour frame and needles <\s>
<s> i am sorry she said after a pause in a hard dry voice i repeat i am sorry that i showed myself so ungrateful for the safety of my son <\s>
<s> it was not at all my wish that you should leave us i am sure unless you found pleasure elsewhere <\s>
<s> but you must perceive mr <\s>
<s> esmond that at your age and with your tastes it is impossible that you can continue to stay upon the intimate footing in which you have been in this family <\s>
<s> you have wished to go to the university and i think tis quite as well that you should be sent thither <\s>
<s> i did not press this matter thinking you a child as you are indeed in years quite a child and i should never have thought of treating you otherwise until until these circumstances came to light <\s>
<s> and i shall beg my lord to despatch you as quick as possible and will go on with frank's learning as well as i can i owe my father thanks for a little grounding and you i'm sure for much that you have taught me and and i wish you a good night mr <\s>
<s> and with this she dropped a stately curtsy and taking her candle went away through the tapestry door which led to her apartments <\s>
<s> esmond stood by the fireplace blankly staring after her <\s>
<s> indeed he scarce seemed to see until she was gone and then her image was impressed upon him and remained for ever fixed upon his memory <\s>
<s> he saw her retreating the taper lighting up her marble face her scarlet lip quivering and her shining golden hair <\s>
<s> he went to his own room and to bed where he tried to read as his custom was but he never knew what he was reading until afterwards he remembered the appearance of the letters of the book it was in montaigne's essays and the events of the day passed before him that is of the last hour of the day for as for the morning and the poor milkmaid yonder he never so much as once thought <\s>
<s> and he could not get to sleep until daylight and woke with a violent headache and quite unrefreshed <\s>
<s> he had brought the contagion with him from the three castles sure enough and was presently laid up with the smallpox which spared the hall no more than it did the cottage <\s>

<s> when harry esmond passed through the crisis of that malady and returned to health again he found that little frank esmond had also suffered and rallied after the disease and the lady his mother was down with it with a couple more of the household <\s>
<s> it was a providence for which we all ought to be thankful doctor tusher said that my lady and her son were spared while death carried off the poor domestics of the house and rebuked harry for asking in his simple way for which we ought to be thankful that the servants were killed or the gentlefolks were saved <\s>
<s> nor could young esmond agree in the doctor's vehement protestations to my lady when he visited her during her convalescence that the malady had not in the least impaired her charms and had not been churl enough to injure the fair features of the viscountess of castlewood whereas in spite of these fine speeches harry thought that her ladyship's beauty was very much injured by the small pox <\s>
<s> when the marks of the disease cleared away they did not it is true leave furrows or scars on her face except one perhaps on her forehead over her left eyebrow ); but the delicacy of her rosy color and complexion was gone her eyes had lost their brilliancy her hair fell and her face looked older <\s>
<s> it was as if a coarse hand had rubbed off the delicate tints of that sweet picture and brought it as one has seen unskilful painting cleaners do to the dead color <\s>
<s> also it must be owned that for a year or two after the malady her ladyship's nose was swollen and redder <\s>
