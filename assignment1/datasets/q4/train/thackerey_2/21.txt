<s> my lady only said i hope you will tell none of these silly stories elsewhere than at home francis <\s>
<s> tis true on my word continues frank look at harry scowling mother and see how beatrix blushes as red as the silver clocked stockings <\s>
<s> i think we had best leave the gentlemen to their wine and their talk says mistress beatrix rising up with the air of a young queen tossing her rustling flowing draperies about her and quitting the room followed by her mother <\s>
<s> lady castlewood again looked at esmond as she stooped down and kissed frank <\s>
<s> do not tell those silly stories child she said do not drink much wine sir harry never loved to drink wine <\s>
<s> this might have been my life he was thinking this might have been my duty from now till old age <\s>
<s> well were it not a pleasant one to be with these dear friends and part from em no more <\s>
<s> until until the destined lover comes and takes away pretty beatrix and the best part of tom tusher's exposition which may have been very learned and eloquent was quite lost to poor harry by this vision of the destined lover who put the preacher out <\s>
<s> all the while of the prayers beatrix knelt a little way before harry esmond <\s>
<s> the red stockings were changed for a pair of gray and black shoes in which her feet looked to the full as pretty <\s>
<s> all the roses of spring could not vie with the brightness of her complexion esmond thought he had never seen anything like the sunny lustre of her eyes <\s>
<s> my lady viscountess looked fatigued as if with watching and her face was pale <\s>
<s> miss beatrix remarked these signs of indisposition in her mother and deplored them <\s>
<s> i am an old woman says my lady with a kind smile i cannot hope to look as young as you do my dear <\s>
<s> she'll never look as good as you do if she lives till she's a hundred says my lord taking his mother by the waist and kissing her hand <\s>
<s> do i look very wicked cousin <\s>
<s> says beatrix turning full round on esmond with her pretty face so close under his chin that the soft perfumed hair touched it <\s>
<s> she laid her finger tips on his sleeve as she spoke and he put his other hand over hers <\s>
<s> i'm like your looking glass says he and that can't flatter you <\s>
<s> he means that you are always looking at him my dear says her mother archly <\s>
<s> beatrix ran away from esmond at this and flew to her mamma whom she kissed stopping my lady's mouth with her pretty hand <\s>
<s> and harry is very good to look at says my lady with her fond eyes regarding the young man <\s>
<s> if tis good to see a happy face says he you see that <\s>
<s> my lady said amen with a sigh and harry thought the memory of her dear lord rose up and rebuked her back again into sadness for her face lost the smile and resumed its look of melancholy <\s>
<s> why harry how fine we look in our scarlet and silver and our black periwig cries my lord <\s>
<s> mother i am tired of my own hair <\s>
<s> when shall i have a peruke <\s>
<s> where did you get your steenkirk harry <\s>
<s> it's some of my lady dowager's lace says harry she gave me this and a number of other fine things <\s>
<s> my lady dowager isn't such a bad woman my lord continued <\s>
<s> she's not so so red as she's painted says miss beatrix <\s>
<s> her brother broke into a laugh <\s>
<s> i'll tell her you said so by the lord trix i will he cries out <\s>
<s> she'll know that you hadn't the wit to say it my lord says miss beatrix <\s>
<s> we won't quarrel the first day harry's here will we mother <\s>
<s> said the young lord <\s>
<s> we'll see if we can get on to the new year without a fight <\s>
<s> have some of this christmas pie <\s>
<s> and here comes the tankard no it's pincot with the tea <\s>
<s> will the captain choose a dish <\s>
<s> i say harry my lord goes on i'll show thee my horses after breakfast and we'll go a bird netting to night and on monday there's a cock match at winchester do you love cock fighting harry between the gentlemen of sussex and the gentlemen of hampshire at ten pound the battle and fifty pound the odd battle to show one and twenty cocks <\s>
<s> and what will you do beatrix to amuse our kinsman <\s>
<s> i'll listen to him says beatrix <\s>
<s> i am sure he has a hundred things to tell us <\s>
<s> and i'm jealous already of the spanish ladies <\s>
<s> was that a beautiful nun at cadiz that you rescued from the soldiers <\s>
<s> your man talked of it last night in the kitchen and mrs <\s>
<s> betty told me this morning as she combed my hair <\s>
<s> and he says you must be in love for you sat on deck all night and scribbled verses all day in your tablebook <\s>
<s> harry thought if he had wanted a subject for verses yesterday to day he had found one and not all the lindamiras and ardelias of the poets were half so beautiful as this young creature but he did not say so though some one did for him <\s>
<s> this was his dear lady who after the meal was over and the young people were gone began talking of her children with mr <\s>
<s> esmond and of the characters of one and the other and of her hopes and fears for both of them <\s>
<s> tis not while they are at home she said and in their mother's nest i fear for them 'tis when they are gone into the world whither i shall not be able to follow them <\s>
<s> beatrix will begin her service next year <\s>
<s> you may have heard a rumor about about my lord blandford <\s>
<s> they were both children and it is but idle talk <\s>
<s> i know my kinswoman would never let him make such a poor marriage as our beatrix would be <\s>
<s> there's scarce a princess in europe that she thinks is good enough for him or for her ambition <\s>
<s> there's not a princess in europe to compare with her says esmond <\s>
<s> no perhaps not answered my lady <\s>
<s> she is most beautiful isn't she <\s>
<s> tis not a mother's partiality that deceives me <\s>
<s> i marked you yesterday when she came down the stair and read it in your face <\s>
<s> we look when you don't fancy us looking and see better than you think dear harry and just now when they spoke about your poems you writ pretty lines when you were but a boy you thought beatrix was a pretty subject for verse did not you harry <\s>
<s> the gentleman could only blush for a reply and so she is nor are you the first her pretty face has captivated <\s>
<s> such a pair of bright eyes as hers learn their power very soon and use it very early <\s>
<s> and looking at him keenly with hers the fair widow left him <\s>
<s> and so it is a pair of bright eyes with a dozen glances suffice to subdue a man to enslave him and inflame him to make him even forget they dazzle him so that the past becomes straightway dim to him and he so prizes them that he would give all his life to possess em <\s>
<s> what is the fond love of dearest friends compared to this treasure <\s>
<s> is memory as strong as expectancy <\s>
<s> i have looked at royal diamonds in the jewel rooms in europe and thought how wars have been made about em mogul sovereigns deposed and strangled for them or ransomed with them millions expended to buy them and daring lives lost in digging out the little shining toys that i value no more than the button in my hat <\s>
<s> and so there are other glittering baubles of rare water too for which men have been set to kill and quarrel ever since mankind began and which last but for a score of years when their sparkle is over <\s>
<s> where are those jewels now that beamed under cleopatra's forehead or shone in the sockets of helen <\s>
<s> the second day after esmond's coming to walcote tom tusher had leave to take a holiday and went off in his very best gown and bands to court the young woman whom his reverence desired to marry and who was not a viscount's widow as it turned out but a brewer's relict at southampton with a couple of thousand pounds to her fortune for honest tom's heart was under such excellent control that venus herself without a portion would never have caused it to flutter <\s>
<s> so he rode away on his heavy paced gelding to pursue his jog trot loves leaving esmond to the society of his dear mistress and her daughter and with his young lord for a companion who was charmed not only to see an old friend but to have the tutor and his latin books put out of the way <\s>
<s> the boy talked of things and people and not a little about himself in his frank artless way <\s>
<s> twas easy to see that he and his sister had the better of their fond mother for the first place in whose affections though they fought constantly and though the kind lady persisted that she loved both equally twas not difficult to understand that frank was his mother's darling and favorite <\s>
<s> he ruled the whole household always excepting rebellious beatrix not less now than when he was a child marshalling the village boys in playing at soldiers and caning them lustily too like the sturdiest corporal <\s>
<s> as for tom tusher his reverence treated the young lord with that politeness and deference which he always showed for a great man whatever his age or his stature was <\s>
<s> indeed with respect to this young one it was impossible not to love him so frank and winning were his manners his beauty his gayety the ring of his laughter and the delightful tone of his voice <\s>
<s> wherever he went he charmed and domineered <\s>
<s> i think his old grandfather the dean and the grim old housekeeper mrs <\s>
<s> pincot were as much his slaves as his mother was and as for esmond he found himself presently submitting to a certain fascination the boy had and slaving it like the rest of the family <\s>
<s> the pleasure which he had in frank's mere company and converse exceeded that which he ever enjoyed in the society of any other man however delightful in talk or famous for wit <\s>
<s> his presence brought sunshine into a room his laugh his prattle his noble beauty and brightness of look cheered and charmed indescribably <\s>
<s> at the least tale of sorrow his hands were in his purse and he was eager with sympathy and bounty <\s>
