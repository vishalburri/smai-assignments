<s> it was a market day and the country people were all assembled with their baskets of poultry eggs and such things the postilion had no sooner lashed the man who would have taken hold of his horse but a great cabbage came whirling like a bombshell into the carriage at which my lord laughed more for it knocked my lady's fan out of her hand and plumped into father holt's stomach <\s>
<s> then came a shower of carrots and potatoes <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake be still <\s>
<s> holt we are not ten paces from the bell archway where they can shut the gates on us and keep out this canaille <\s>
<s> the little page was outside the coach on the step and a fellow in the crowd aimed a potato at him and hit him in the eye at which the poor little wretch set up a shout the man laughed a great big saddler's apprentice of the town <\s>
<s> you d little yelling popish bastard he said and stooped to pick up another the crowd had gathered quite between the horses and the inn door by this time and the coach was brought to a dead stand still <\s>
<s> my lord jumped as briskly as a boy out of the door on his side of the coach squeezing little harry behind it had hold of the potato thrower's collar in an instant and the next moment the brute's heels were in the air and he fell on the stones with a thump <\s>
<s> says he you pack of screaming blackguards <\s>
<s> how dare you attack children and insult women <\s>
<s> fling another shot at that carriage you sneaking pigskin cobbler and by the lord i'll send my rapier through you <\s>
<s> some of the mob cried huzzah my lord <\s>
<s> for they knew him and the saddler's man was a known bruiser near twice as big as my lord viscount <\s>
<s> make way there says he he spoke in a high shrill voice but with a great air of authority <\s>
<s> make way and let her ladyship's carriage pass <\s>
<s> the men that were between the coach and the gate of the bell actually did make way and the horses went in my lord walking after them with his hat on his head <\s>
<s> as he was going in at the gate through which the coach had just rolled another cry begins of no popery no papists <\s>
<s> my lord turns round and faces them once more <\s>
<s> god save the king <\s>
<s> says he at the highest pitch of his voice <\s>
<s> who dares abuse the king's religion <\s>
<s> you you d d psalm singing cobbler as sure as i'm a magistrate of this county i'll commit you <\s>
<s> the fellow shrank back and my lord retreated with all the honors of the day <\s>
<s> but when the little flurry caused by the scene was over and the flush passed off his face he relapsed into his usual languor trifled with his little dog and yawned when my lady spoke to him <\s>
<s> this mob was one of many thousands that were going about the country at that time huzzahing for the acquittal of the seven bishops who had been tried just then and about whom little harry esmond at that time knew scarce anything <\s>
<s> it was assizes at hexton and there was a great meeting of the gentry at the bell and my lord's people had their new liveries on and harry a little suit of blue and silver which he wore upon occasions of state and the gentlefolks came round and talked to my lord and a judge in a red gown who seemed a very great personage especially complimented him and my lady who was mighty grand <\s>
<s> harry remembers her train borne up by her gentlewoman <\s>
<s> there was an assembly and ball at the great room at the bell and other young gentlemen of the county families looked on as he did <\s>
<s> one of them jeered him for his black eye which was swelled by the potato and another called him a bastard on which he and harry fell to fisticuffs <\s>
<s> my lord's cousin colonel esmond of walcote was there and separated the two lads a great tall gentleman with a handsome good natured face <\s>
<s> the boy did not know how nearly in after life he should be allied to colonel esmond and how much kindness he should have to owe him <\s>
<s> there was little love between the two families <\s>
<s> my lady used not to spare colonel esmond in talking of him for reasons which have been hinted already but about which at his tender age henry esmond could be expected to know nothing <\s>
<s> very soon afterwards my lord and lady went to london with mr <\s>
<s> holt leaving however the page behind them <\s>
<s> the little man had the great house of castlewood to himself or between him and the housekeeper mrs <\s>
<s> worksop an old lady who was a kinswoman of the family in some distant way and a protestant but a staunch tory and king's man as all the esmonds were <\s>
<s> he used to go to school to dr <\s>
<s> tusher when he was at home though the doctor was much occupied too <\s>
<s> there was a great stir and commotion everywhere even in the little quiet village of castlewood whither a party of people came from the town who would have broken castlewood chapel windows but the village people turned out and even old sieveright the republican blacksmith along with them for my lady though she was a papist and had many odd ways was kind to the tenantry and there was always a plenty of beef and blankets and medicine for the poor at castlewood hall <\s>
<s> a kingdom was changing hands whilst my lord and lady were away <\s>
<s> king james was flying the dutchmen were coming awful stories about them and the prince of orange used old mrs <\s>
<s> worksop to tell to the idle little page <\s>
<s> he liked the solitude of the great house very well he had all the play books to read and no father holt to whip him and a hundred childish pursuits and pastimes without doors and within which made this time very pleasant <\s>
<s> my superiors are engaged in plots for the restoration of king james ii <\s>
<s> not having been able to sleep for thinking of some lines for eels which he had placed the night before the lad was lying in his little bed waiting for the hour when the gate would be open and he and his comrade john lockwood the porter's son might go to the pond and see what fortune had brought them <\s>
<s> at daybreak john was to awaken him but his own eagerness for the sport had served as a reveillez long since so long that it seemed to him as if the day never would come <\s>
<s> it might have been four o'clock when he heard the door of the opposite chamber the chaplain's room open and the voice of a man coughing in the passage <\s>
<s> harry jumped up thinking for certain it was a robber or hoping perhaps for a ghost and flinging open his own door saw before him the chaplain's door open and a light inside and a figure standing in the doorway in the midst of a great smoke which issued from the room <\s>
<s> cried out the boy who was of a good spirit <\s>
<s> whispered the other tis i my boy <\s>
<s> and holding his hand out harry had no difficulty in recognizing his master and friend father holt <\s>
<s> a curtain was over the window of the chaplain's room that looked to the court and harry saw that the smoke came from a great flame of papers which were burning in a brazier when he entered the chaplain's room <\s>
<s> after giving a hasty greeting and blessing to the lad who was charmed to see his tutor the father continued the burning of his papers drawing them from a cupboard over the mantel piece wall which harry had never seen before <\s>
<s> father holt laughed seeing the lad's attention fixed at once on this hole <\s>
<s> that is right harry he said faithful little famuli see all and say nothing <\s>
<s> you are faithful i know <\s>
<s> i know i would go to the stake for you said harry <\s>
<s> i don't want your head said the father patting it kindly all you have to do is to hold your tongue <\s>
<s> let us burn these papers and say nothing to anybody <\s>
<s> should you like to read them <\s>
<s> harry esmond blushed and held down his head he had looked as the fact was and without thinking at the paper before him and though he had seen it could not understand a word of it the letters being quite clear enough but quite without meaning <\s>
<s> they burned the papers beating down the ashes in a brazier so that scarce any traces of them remained <\s>
<s> harry had been accustomed to see father holt in more dresses than one it not being safe or worth the danger for popish ecclesiastics to wear their proper dress and he was in consequence in no wise astonished that the priest should now appear before him in a riding dress with large buff leather boots and a feather to his hat plain but such as gentlemen wore <\s>
<s> you know the secret of the cupboard said he laughing and must be prepared for other mysteries and he opened but not a secret cupboard this time only a wardrobe which he usually kept locked and from which he now took out two or three dresses and perruques of different colors and a couple of swords of a pretty make father holt was an expert practitioner with the small sword and every day whilst he was at home he and his pupil practised this exercise in which the lad became a very great proficient a military coat and cloak and a farmer's smock and placed them in the large hole over the mantel piece from which the papers had been taken <\s>
<s> if they miss the cupboard he said they will not find these if they find them they'll tell no tales except that father holt wore more suits of clothes than one <\s>
<s> you know what deceivers we are harry <\s>
<s> harry was alarmed at the notion that his friend was about to leave him but no the priest said i may very likely come back with my lord in a few days <\s>
<s> we are to be tolerated we are not to be persecuted <\s>
<s> but they may take a fancy to pay a visit at castlewood ere our return and as gentlemen of my cloth are suspected they might choose to examine my papers which concern nobody at least not them <\s>
<s> and to this day whether the papers in cipher related to politics or to the affairs of that mysterious society whereof father holt was a member his pupil harry esmond remains in entire ignorance <\s>
<s> the rest of his goods his small wardrobe c <\s>
<s> holt left untouched on his shelves and in his cupboard taking down with a laugh however and flinging into the brazier where he only half burned them some theological treatises which he had been writing against the english divines <\s>
<s> and now said he henry my son you may testify with a safe conscience that you saw me burning latin sermons the last time i was here before i went away to london and it will be daybreak directly and i must be away before lockwood is stirring <\s>
<s> will not lockwood let you out sir <\s>
<s> holt laughed he was never more gay or good humored than when in the midst of action or danger <\s>
<s> lockwood knows nothing of my being here mind you he said nor would you you little wretch <\s>
<s> had you slept better <\s>
<s> you must forget that i have been here and now farewell <\s>
<s> close the door and go to your own room and don't come out till stay why should you not know one secret more <\s>
<s> i know you will never betray me <\s>
<s> in the chaplain's room were two windows the one looking into the court facing westwards to the fountain the other a small casement strongly barred and looking on to the green in front of the hall <\s>
<s> this window was too high to reach from the ground but mounting on a buffet which stood beneath it father holt showed me how by pressing on the base of the window the whole framework of lead glass and iron stanchions descended into a cavity worked below from which it could be drawn and restored to its usual place from without a broken pane being purposely open to admit the hand which was to work upon the spring of the machine <\s>
<s> when i am gone father holt said you may push away the buffet so that no one may fancy that an exit has been made that way lock the door place the key where shall we put the key under chrysostom on the book shelf and if any ask for it say i keep it there and told you where to find it if you had need to go to my room <\s>
<s> the descent is easy down the wall into the ditch and so once more farewell until i see thee again my dear son <\s>
<s> and with this the intrepid father mounted the buffet with great agility and briskness stepped across the window lifting up the bars and framework again from the other side and only leaving room for harry esmond to stand on tiptoe and kiss his hand before the casement closed the bars fixing as firmly as ever seemingly in the stone arch overhead <\s>
<s> when father holt next arrived at castlewood it was by the public gate on horseback and he never so much as alluded to the existence of the private issue to harry except when he had need of a private messenger from within for which end no doubt he had instructed his young pupil in the means of quitting the hall <\s>
<s> esmond young as he was would have died sooner than betray his friend and master as mr <\s>
<s> holt well knew for he had tried the boy more than once putting temptations in his way to see whether he would yield to them and confess afterwards or whether he would resist them as he did sometimes or whether he would lie which he never did <\s>
<s> holt instructing the boy on this point however that if to keep silence is not to lie as it certainly is not yet silence is after all equivalent to a negation and therefore a downright no in the interest of justice or your friend and in reply to a question that may be prejudicial to either is not criminal but on the contrary praiseworthy and as lawful a way as the other of eluding a wrongful demand <\s>
<s> for instance says he suppose a good citizen who had seen his majesty take refuge there had been asked is king charles up that oak tree <\s>
<s> his duty would have been not to say yes so that the cromwellians should seize the king and murder him like his father but no his majesty being private in the tree and therefore not to be seen there by loyal eyes all which instruction in religion and morals as well as in the rudiments of the tongues and sciences the boy took eagerly and with gratitude from his tutor <\s>
<s> when then holt was gone and told harry not to see him it was as if he had never been <\s>
<s> and he had this answer pat when he came to be questioned a few days after <\s>
<s> the prince of orange was then at salisbury as young esmond learned from seeing doctor tusher in his best cassock though the roads were muddy and he never was known to wear his silk only his stuff one a horseback with a great orange cockade in his broad leafed hat and nahum his clerk ornamented with a like decoration <\s>
<s> the doctor was walking up and down in front of his parsonage when little esmond saw him and heard him say he was going to pay his duty to his highness the prince as he mounted his pad and rode away with nahum behind <\s>
<s> the village people had orange cockades too and his friend the blacksmith's laughing daughter pinned one into harry's old hat which he tore out indignantly when they bade him to cry god save the prince of orange and the protestant religion <\s>
<s> but the people only laughed for they liked the boy in the village where his solitary condition moved the general pity and where he found friendly welcomes and faces in many houses <\s>
<s> father holt had many friends there too for he not only would fight the blacksmith at theology never losing his temper but laughing the whole time in his pleasant way but he cured him of an ague with quinquina and was always ready with a kind word for any man that asked it so that they said in the village twas a pity the two were papists <\s>
<s> the director and the vicar of castlewood agreed very well indeed the former was a perfectly bred gentleman and it was the latter's business to agree with everybody <\s>
<s> doctor tusher and the lady's maid his spouse had a boy who was about the age of little esmond and there was such a friendship between the lads as propinquity and tolerable kindness and good humor on either side would be pretty sure to occasion <\s>
