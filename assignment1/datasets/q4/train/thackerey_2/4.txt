<s> tusher was away at salisbury that there came a troop of dragoons with orange scarfs and quartered in castlewood and some of them came up to the hall where they took possession robbing nothing however beyond the hen house and the beer cellar and only insisting upon going through the house and looking for papers <\s>
<s> the first room they asked to look at was father holt's room of which harry esmond brought the key and they opened the drawers and the cupboards and tossed over the papers and clothes but found nothing except his books and clothes and the vestments in a box by themselves with which the dragoons made merry to harry esmond's horror <\s>
<s> and to the questions which the gentleman put to harry he replied that father holt was a very kind man to him and a very learned man and harry supposed would tell him none of his secrets if he had any <\s>
<s> he was about eleven years old at this time and looked as innocent as boys of his age <\s>
<s> the family were away more than six months and when they returned they were in the deepest state of dejection for king james had been banished the prince of orange was on the throne and the direst persecutions of those of the catholic faith were apprehended by my lady who said she did not believe that there was a word of truth in the promises of toleration that dutch monster made or in a single word the perjured wretch said <\s>
<s> my lord and lady were in a manner prisoners in their own house so her ladyship gave the little page to know who was by this time growing of an age to understand what was passing about him and something of the characters of the people he lived with <\s>
<s> we are prisoners says she in everything but chains we are prisoners <\s>
<s> let them come let them consign me to dungeons or strike off my head from this poor little throat and she clasped it in her long fingers <\s>
<s> the blood of the esmonds will always flow freely for their kings <\s>
<s> we are not like the churchills the judases who kiss their master and betray him <\s>
<s> we know how to suffer how even to forgive in the royal cause no doubt it was to that fatal business of losing the place of groom of the posset to which her ladyship alluded as she did half a dozen times in the day <\s>
<s> let the tyrant of orange bring his rack and his odious dutch tortures the beast <\s>
<s> i spit upon him and defy him <\s>
<s> cheerfully will i lay this head upon the block cheerfully will i accompany my lord to the scaffold we will cry god save king james <\s>
<s> with our dying breath and smile in the face of the executioner <\s>
<s> and she told her page a hundred times at least of the particulars of the last interview which she had with his majesty <\s>
<s> i flung myself before my liege's feet she said at salisbury <\s>
<s> i devoted myself my husband my house to his cause <\s>
<s> perhaps he remembered old times when isabella esmond was young and fair perhaps he recalled the day when twas not i that knelt at least he spoke to me with a voice that reminded me of days gone by <\s>
<s> said his majesty you should go to the prince of orange if you want anything <\s>
<s> no sire i replied i would not kneel to a usurper the esmond that would have served your majesty will never be groom to a traitor's posset <\s>
<s> the royal exile smiled even in the midst of his misfortune he deigned to raise me with words of consolation <\s>
<s> the viscount my husband himself could not be angry at the august salute with which he honored me <\s>
<s> the public misfortune had the effect of making my lord and his lady better friends than they ever had been since their courtship <\s>
<s> my lord viscount had shown both loyalty and spirit when these were rare qualities in the dispirited party about the king and the praise he got elevated him not a little in his wife's good opinion and perhaps in his own <\s>
<s> he wakened up from the listless and supine life which he had been leading was always riding to and fro in consultation with this friend or that of the king's the page of course knowing little of his doings but remarking only his greater cheerfulness and altered demeanor <\s>
<s> father holt came to the hall constantly but officiated no longer openly as chaplain he was always fetching and carrying strangers military and ecclesiastic harry knew the latter though they came in all sorts of disguises were continually arriving and departing <\s>
<s> my lord made long absences and sudden reappearances using sometimes the means of exit which father holt had employed though how often the little window in the chaplain's room let in or let out my lord and his friends harry could not tell <\s>
<s> he stoutly kept his promise to the father of not prying and if at midnight from his little room he heard noises of persons stirring in the next chamber he turned round to the wall and hid his curiosity under his pillow until it fell asleep <\s>
<s> of course he could not help remarking that the priest's journeys were constant and understanding by a hundred signs that some active though secret business employed him what this was may pretty well be guessed by what soon happened to my lord <\s>
<s> no garrison or watch was put into castlewood when my lord came back but a guard was in the village and one or other of them was always on the green keeping a look out on our great gate and those who went out and in <\s>
<s> lockwood said that at night especially every person who came in or went out was watched by the outlying sentries <\s>
<s> twas lucky that we had a gate which their worships knew nothing about <\s>
<s> my lord and father holt must have made constant journeys at night once or twice little harry acted as their messenger and discreet little aide de camp <\s>
<s> he remembers he was bidden to go into the village with his fishing rod enter certain houses ask for a drink of water and tell the good man there would be a horse market at newbury next thursday and so carry the same message on to the next house on his list <\s>
<s> he did not know what the message meant at the time nor what was happening which may as well however for clearness sake be explained here <\s>
<s> the prince of orange being gone to ireland where the king was ready to meet him with a great army it was determined that a great rising of his majesty's party should take place in this country and my lord was to head the force in our county <\s>
<s> of late he had taken a greater lead in affairs than before having the indefatigable mr <\s>
<s> holt at his elbow and my lady viscountess strongly urging him on and my lord sark being in the tower a prisoner and sir wilmot crawley of queen's crawley having gone over to the prince of orange's side my lord became the most considerable person in our part of the county for the affairs of the king <\s>
<s> it was arranged that the regiment of scots grays and dragoons then quartered at newbury should declare for the king on a certain day when likewise the gentry affected to his majesty's cause were to come in with their tenants and adherents to newbury march upon the dutch troops at reading under ginckel and these overthrown and their indomitable little master away in ireland twas thought that our side might move on london itself and a confident victory was predicted for the king <\s>
<s> as these great matters were in agitation my lord lost his listless manner and seemed to gain health my lady did not scold him mr <\s>
<s> holt came to and fro busy always and little harry longed to have been a few inches taller that he might draw a sword in this good cause <\s>
<s> one day it must have been about the month of july 1690 my lord in a great horseman's coat under which harry could see the shining of a steel breastplate he had on called little harry to him put the hair off the child's forehead and kissed him and bade god bless him in such an affectionate way as he never had used before <\s>
<s> father holt blessed him too and then they took leave of my lady viscountess who came from her apartment with a pocket handkerchief to her eyes and her gentlewoman and mrs <\s>
<s> you are going to to ride says she <\s>
<s> oh that i might come too but in my situation i am forbidden horse exercise <\s>
<s> we kiss my lady marchioness's hand says mr <\s>
<s> my lord god speed you <\s>
<s> she said stepping up and embracing my lord in a grand manner <\s>
<s> holt i ask your blessing and she knelt down for that whilst mrs <\s>
<s> tusher tossed her head up <\s>
<s> holt gave the same benediction to the little page who went down and held my lord's stirrups for him to mount there were two servants waiting there too and they rode out of castlewood gate <\s>
<s> as they crossed the bridge harry could see an officer in scarlet ride up touching his hat and address my lord <\s>
<s> the party stopped and came to some parley or discussion which presently ended my lord putting his horse into a canter after taking off his hat and making a bow to the officer who rode alongside him step for step the trooper accompanying him falling back and riding with my lord's two men <\s>
<s> they cantered over the green and behind the elms my lord waving his hand harry thought and so they disappeared <\s>
<s> that evening we had a great panic the cow boy coming at milking time riding one of our horses which he had found grazing at the outer park wall <\s>
<s> all night my lady viscountess was in a very quiet and subdued mood <\s>
<s> she scarce found fault with anybody she played at cards for six hours little page esmond went to sleep <\s>
<s> he prayed for my lord and the good cause before closing his eyes <\s>
<s> it was quite in the gray of the morning when the porter's bell rang and old lockwood waking up let in one of my lord's servants who had gone with him in the morning and who returned with a melancholy story <\s>
<s> the officer who rode up to my lord had it appeared said to him that it was his duty to inform his lordship that he was not under arrest but under surveillance and to request him not to ride abroad that day <\s>
<s> my lord replied that riding was good for his health that if the captain chose to accompany him he was welcome and it was then that he made a bow and they cantered away together <\s>
<s> when he came on to wansey down my lord all of a sudden pulled up and the party came to a halt at the cross way <\s>
<s> sir says he to the officer we are four to two will you be so kind as to take that road and leave me go mine <\s>
<s> your road is mine my lord says the officer <\s>
<s> then says my lord but he had no time to say more for the officer drawing a pistol snapped it at his lordship as at the same moment father holt drawing a pistol shot the officer through the head <\s>
<s> it was done and the man dead in an instant of time <\s>
<s> the orderly gazing at the officer looked seared for a moment and galloped away for his life <\s>
<s> cries out father holt sending another shot after the trooper but the two servants were too much surprised to use their pieces and my lord calling to them to hold their hands the fellow got away <\s>
<s> holt qui pensait a tout says blaise gets off his horse examines the pockets of the dead officer for papers gives his money to us two and says the wine is drawn m <\s>
<s> le marquis why did he say marquis to m <\s>
<s> le vicomte we must drink it <\s>
<s> the poor gentleman's horse was a better one than that i rode blaise continues mr <\s>
<s> holt bids me get on him and so i gave a cut to whitefoot and she trotted home <\s>
<s> we rode on towards newbury we heard firing towards midday at two o'clock a horseman comes up to us as we were giving our cattle water at an inn and says all is done <\s>
<s> the ecossais declared an hour too soon general ginckel was down upon them <\s>
<s> the whole thing was at an end <\s>
<s> and we've shot an officer on duty and let his orderly escape says my lord <\s>
<s> holt writing two lines on his table book one for my lady and one for you master harry you must go back to castlewood and deliver these and behold me <\s>
<s> and he gave harry the two papers <\s>
<s> he read that to himself which only said burn the papers in the cupboard burn this <\s>
<s> you know nothing about anything <\s>
<s> harry read this ran up stairs to his mistress's apartment where her gentlewoman slept near to the door made her bring a light and wake my lady into whose hands he gave the paper <\s>
<s> she was a wonderful object to look at in her night attire nor had harry ever seen the like <\s>
<s> as soon as she had the paper in her hand harry stepped back to the chaplain's room opened the secret cupboard over the fireplace burned all the papers in it and as he had seen the priest do before took down one of his reverence's manuscript sermons and half burnt that in the brazier <\s>
<s> by the time the papers were quite destroyed it was daylight <\s>
<s> harry ran back to his mistress again <\s>
<s> her gentlewoman ushered him again into her ladyship's chamber she told him from behind her nuptial curtains to bid the coach be got ready and that she would ride away anon <\s>
<s> but the mysteries of her ladyship's toilet were as awfully long on this day as on any other and long after the coach was ready my lady was still attiring herself <\s>
<s> and just as the viscountess stepped forth from her room ready for departure young john lockwood comes running up from the village with news that a lawyer three officers and twenty or four and twenty soldiers were marching thence upon the house <\s>
<s> john had but two minutes the start of them and ere he had well told his story the troop rode into our court yard <\s>
<s> the issue of the plots the death of thomas third viscount of castlewood and the imprisonment of his viscountess <\s>
<s> at first my lady was for dying like mary queen of scots to whom she fancied she bore a resemblance in beauty and stroking her scraggy neck said they will find isabel of castlewood is equal to her fate <\s>
<s> her gentlewoman victoire persuaded her that her prudent course was as she could not fly to receive the troops as though she suspected nothing and that her chamber was the best place wherein to await them <\s>
<s> so her black japan casket which harry was to carry to the coach was taken back to her ladyship's chamber whither the maid and mistress retired <\s>
<s> victoire came out presently bidding the page to say her ladyship was ill confined to her bed with the rheumatism <\s>
<s> by this time the soldiers had reached castlewood <\s>
