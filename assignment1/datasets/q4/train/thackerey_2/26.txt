<s> i venture to promise the verses shall lose nothing by my reading and then sir we shall see whether lord halifax has a right to complain that his friend's pension is no longer paid <\s>
<s> and without more ado the courtier in lace seized the manuscript pages placed them in his breast with his ruffled hand over his heart executed a most gracious wave of the hat with the disengaged hand and smiled and bowed out of the room leaving an odor of pomander behind him <\s>
<s> does not the chamber look quite dark <\s>
<s> i have heard of you says mr <\s>
<s> addison with a smile as indeed everybody about town had heard that unlucky story about esmond's dowager aunt and the duchess <\s>
<s> we were going to the george to take a bottle before the play says steele wilt thou be one joe <\s>
<s> addison said his own lodgings were hard by where he was still rich enough to give a good bottle of wine to his friends and invited the two gentlemen to his apartment in the haymarket whither we accordingly went <\s>
<s> i shall get credit with my landlady says he with a smile when she sees two such fine gentlemen as you come up my stair <\s>
<s> and he politely made his visitors welcome to his apartment which was indeed but a shabby one though no grandee of the land could receive his guests with a more perfect and courtly grace than this gentleman <\s>
<s> a frugal dinner consisting of a slice of meat and a penny loaf was awaiting the owner of the lodgings <\s>
<s> my wine is better than my meat says mr <\s>
<s> addison my lord halifax sent me the burgundy <\s>
<s> and he set a bottle and glasses before his friends and ate his simple dinner in a very few minutes after which the three fell to and began to drink <\s>
<s> you see says mr <\s>
<s> addison pointing to his writing table whereon was a map of the action at hochstedt and several other gazettes and pamphlets relating to the battle that i too am busy about your affairs captain <\s>
<s> i am engaged as a poetical gazetteer to say truth and am writing a poem on the campaign <\s>
<s> so esmond at the request of his host told him what he knew about the famous battle drew the river on the table aliquo mero and with the aid of some bits of tobacco pipe showed the advance of the left wing where he had been engaged <\s>
<s> a sheet or two of the verses lay already on the table beside our bottles and glasses and dick having plentifully refreshed himself from the latter took up the pages of manuscript writ out with scarce a blot or correction in the author's slim neat handwriting and began to read therefrom with great emphasis and volubility <\s>
<s> at pauses of the verse the enthusiastic reader stopped and fired off a great salvo of applause <\s>
<s> esmond smiled at the enthusiasm of addison's friend <\s>
<s> you are like the german burghers says he and the princes on the mozelle when our army came to a halt they always sent a deputation to compliment the chief and fired a salute with all their artillery from their walls <\s>
<s> and drunk the great chiefs health afterward did not they <\s>
<s> says captain steele gayly filling up a bumper he never was tardy at that sort of acknowledgment of a friend's merit <\s>
<s> and the duke since you will have me act his grace's part says mr <\s>
<s> addison with a smile and something of a blush pledged his friends in return <\s>
<s> most serene elector of covent garden i drink to your highness's health and he filled himself a glass <\s>
<s> joseph required scarce more pressing than dick to that sort of amusement but the wine never seemed at all to fluster mr <\s>
<s> addison's brains it only unloosed his tongue whereas captain steele's head and speech were quite overcome by a single bottle <\s>
<s> no matter what the verses were and to say truth mr <\s>
<s> esmond found some of them more than indifferent dick's enthusiasm for his chief never faltered and in every line from addison's pen steele found a master stroke <\s>
<s> by the time dick had come to that part of the poem wherein the bard describes as blandly as though he were recording a dance at the opera or a harmless bout of bucolic cudgelling at a village fair that bloody and ruthless part of our campaign with the remembrance whereof every soldier who bore a part in it must sicken with shame when we were ordered to ravage and lay waste the elector's country and with fire and murder slaughter and crime a great part of his dominions was overrun when dick came to the lines in vengeance roused the soldier fills his hand with sword and fire and ravages the land in crackling flames a thousand harvests burn a thousand villages to ashes turn <\s>
<s> to the thick woods the woolly flocks retreat and mixed with bellowing herds confusedly bleat <\s>
<s> their trembling lords the common shade partake and cries of infants found in every brake <\s>
<s> the listening soldier fixed in sorrow stands loth to obey his leader's just commands <\s>
<s> the leader grieves by generous pity swayed to see his just commands so well obeyed by this time wine and friendship had brought poor dick to a perfectly maudlin state and he hiccupped out the last line with a tenderness that set one of his auditors a laughing <\s>
<s> i admire the license of your poets says esmond to mr <\s>
<s> dick after reading of the verses was fain to go off insisting on kissing his two dear friends before his departure and reeling away with his periwig over his eyes i admire your art the murder of the campaign is done to military music like a battle at the opera and the virgins shriek in harmony as our victorious grenadiers march into their villages <\s>
<s> do you know what a scene it was by this time perhaps the wine had warmed mr <\s>
<s> esmond's head too what a triumph you are celebrating <\s>
<s> what scenes of shame and horror were enacted over which the commander's genius presided as calm as though he didn't belong to our sphere <\s>
<s> you talk of the listening soldier fixed in sorrow the leader's grief swayed by generous pity to my belief the leader cared no more for bleating flocks than he did for infants cries and many of our ruffians butchered one or the other with equal alacrity <\s>
<s> i was ashamed of my trade when i saw those horrors perpetrated which came under every man's eyes <\s>
<s> you hew out of your polished verses a stately image of smiling victory i tell you tis an uncouth distorted savage idol hideous bloody and barbarous <\s>
<s> the rites performed before it are shocking to think of <\s>
<s> you great poets should show it as it is ugly and horrible not beautiful and serene <\s>
<s> oh sir had you made the campaign believe me you never would have sung it so <\s>
<s> during this little outbreak mr <\s>
<s> addison was listening smoking out of his long pipe and smiling very placidly <\s>
<s> what would you have <\s>
<s> in our polished days and according to the rules of art tis impossible that the muse should depict tortures or begrime her hands with the horrors of war <\s>
<s> these are indicated rather than described as in the greek tragedies that i dare say you have read and sure there can be no more elegant specimens of composition agamemnon is slain or medea's children destroyed away from the scene the chorus occupying the stage and singing of the action to pathetic music <\s>
<s> something of this i attempt my dear sir in my humble way tis a panegyric i mean to write and not a satire <\s>
<s> were i to sing as you would have me the town would tear the poet in pieces and burn his book by the hands of the common hangman <\s>
<s> do you not use tobacco <\s>
<s> of all the weeds grown on earth sure the nicotian is the most soothing and salutary <\s>
<s> we must paint our great duke mr <\s>
<s> addison went on not as a man which no doubt he is with weaknesses like the rest of us but as a hero <\s>
<s> tis in a triumph not a battle that your humble servant is riding his sleek pegasus <\s>
<s> we college poets trot you know on very easy nags it hath been time out of mind part of the poet's profession to celebrate the actions of heroes in verse and to sing the deeds which you men of war perform <\s>
<s> i must follow the rules of my art and the composition of such a strain as this must be harmonious and majestic not familiar or too near the vulgar truth <\s>
<s> si parva licet if virgil could invoke the divine augustus a humbler poet from the banks of the isis may celebrate a victory and a conqueror of our own nation in whose triumphs every briton has a share and whose glory and genius contributes to every citizen's individual honor <\s>
<s> when hath there been since our henrys and edwards days such a great feat of arms as that from which you yourself have brought away marks of distinction <\s>
<s> if tis in my power to sing that song worthily i will do so and be thankful to my muse <\s>
<s> if i fail as a poet as a briton at least i will show my loyalty and fling up my cap and huzzah for the conqueror rheni pacator et istri omnis in hoc uno variis discordia cessit ordinibus laetatur eques plauditque senator votaque patricio certant plebeia favori there were as brave men on that field says mr <\s>
<s> esmond who never could be made to love the duke of marlborough nor to forget those stories which he used to hear in his youth regarding that great chiefs selfishness and treachery there were men at blenheim as good as the leader whom neither knights nor senators applauded nor voices plebeian or patrician favored and who lie there forgotten under the clods <\s>
<s> what poet is there to sing them <\s>
<s> to sing the gallant souls of heroes sent to hades <\s>
<s> addison with a smile <\s>
<s> would you celebrate them all <\s>
<s> if i may venture to question anything in such an admirable work the catalogue of the ships in homer hath always appeared to me as somewhat wearisome what had the poem been supposing the writer had chronicled the names of captains lieutenants rank and file <\s>
<s> one of the greatest of a great man's qualities is success tis the result of all the others tis a latent power in him which compels the favor of the gods and subjugates fortune <\s>
<s> of all his gifts i admire that one in the great marlborough <\s>
<s> every man is brave <\s>
<s> but in being victorious as he is i fancy there is something divine <\s>
<s> in presence of the occasion the great soul of the leader shines out and the god is confessed <\s>
<s> death itself respects him and passes by him to lay others low <\s>
<s> war and carnage flee before him to ravage other parts of the field as hector from before the divine achilles <\s>
<s> you say he hath no pity no more have the gods who are above it and superhuman <\s>
<s> the fainting battle gathers strength at his aspect and wherever he rides victory charges with him <\s>
<s> a couple of days after when mr <\s>
<s> esmond revisited his poetic friend he found this thought struck out in the fervor of conversation improved and shaped into those famous lines which are in truth the noblest in the poem of the campaign <\s>
<s> as the two gentlemen sat engaged in talk mr <\s>
<s> addison solacing himself with his customary pipe the little maid servant that waited on his lodging came up preceding a gentleman in fine laced clothes that had evidently been figuring at court or a great man's levee <\s>
<s> the courtier coughed a little at the smoke of the pipe and looked round the room curiously which was shabby enough as was the owner in his worn snuff colored suit and plain tie wig <\s>
<s> how goes on the magnum opus mr <\s>
<s> says the court gentleman on looking down at the papers that were on the table <\s>
<s> we were but now over it says addison the greatest courtier in the land could not have a more splendid politeness or greater dignity of manner <\s>
<s> here is the plan says he on the table hac ibat simois here ran the little river nebel hic est sigeia tellus here are tallard's quarters at the bowl of this pipe at the attack of which captain esmond was present <\s>
<s> i have the honor to introduce him to mr <\s>
<s> esmond was but now depicting aliquo proelia mixta mero when you came in <\s>
<s> in truth the two gentlemen had been so engaged when the visitor arrived and addison in his smiling way speaking of mr <\s>
<s> webb colonel of esmond's regiment who commanded a brigade in the action and greatly distinguished himself there was lamenting that he could find never a suitable rhyme for webb otherwise the brigade should have had a place in the poet's verses <\s>
<s> and for you you are but a lieutenant says addison and the muse can't occupy herself with any gentleman under the rank of a field officer <\s>
<s> boyle was all impatient to hear saying that my lord treasurer and my lord halifax were equally anxious and addison blushing began reading of his verses and i suspect knew their weak parts as well as the most critical hearer <\s>
<s> when he came to the lines describing the angel that inspired repulsed battalions to engage and taught the doubtful battle where to rage he read with great animation looking at esmond as much as to say you know where that simile came from from our talk and our bottle of burgundy the other day <\s>
<s> the poet's two hearers were caught with enthusiasm and applauded the verses with all their might <\s>
<s> the gentleman of the court sprang up in great delight <\s>
<s> not a word more my dear sir says he <\s>
<s> trust me with the papers i'll defend them with my life <\s>
<s> let me read them over to my lord treasurer whom i am appointed to see in half an hour <\s>
<s> i venture to promise the verses shall lose nothing by my reading and then sir we shall see whether lord halifax has a right to complain that his friend's pension is no longer paid <\s>
<s> and without more ado the courtier in lace seized the manuscript pages placed them in his breast with his ruffled hand over his heart executed a most gracious wave of the hat with the disengaged hand and smiled and bowed out of the room leaving an odor of pomander behind him <\s>
<s> does not the chamber look quite dark <\s>
