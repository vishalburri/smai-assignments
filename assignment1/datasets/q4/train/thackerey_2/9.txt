<s> tis needless in these memoirs to go at any length into the particulars of harry esmond's college career <\s>
<s> it was like that of a hundred young gentlemen of that day <\s>
<s> but he had the ill fortune to be older by a couple of years than most of his fellow students and by his previous solitary mode of bringing up the circumstances of his life and the peculiar thoughtfulness and melancholy that had naturally engendered he was in a great measure cut off from the society of comrades who were much younger and higher spirited than he <\s>
<s> his tutor who had bowed down to the ground as he walked my lord over the college grass plats changed his behavior as soon as the nobleman's back was turned and was at least harry thought so harsh and overbearing <\s>
<s> when the lads used to assemble in their greges in hall harry found himself alone in the midst of that little flock of boys they raised a great laugh at him when he was set on to read latin which he did with the foreign pronunciation taught to him by his old master the jesuit than which he knew no other <\s>
<s> bridge the tutor made him the object of clumsy jokes in which he was fond of indulging <\s>
<s> the young man's spirit was chafed and his vanity mortified and he found himself for some time as lonely in this place as ever he had been at castlewood whither he longed to return <\s>
<s> his birth was a source of shame to him and he fancied a hundred slights and sneers from young and old who no doubt had treated him better had he met them himself more frankly <\s>
<s> and as he looks back in calmer days upon this period of his life which he thought so unhappy he can see that his own pride and vanity caused no small part of the mortifications which he attributed to other's ill will <\s>
<s> the world deals good naturedly with good natured people and i never knew a sulky misanthropist who quarrelled with it but it was he and not it that was in the wrong <\s>
<s> tom tusher gave harry plenty of good advice on this subject for tom had both good sense and good humor but mr <\s>
<s> harry chose to treat his senior with a great deal of superfluous disdain and absurd scorn and would by no means part from his darling injuries in which very likely no man believed but himself <\s>
<s> as for honest doctor bridge the tutor found after a few trials of wit with the pupil that the young man was an ugly subject for wit and that the laugh was often turned against him <\s>
<s> this did not make tutor and pupil any better friends but had so far an advantage for esmond that mr <\s>
<s> bridge was induced to leave him alone and so long as he kept his chapels and did the college exercises required of him bridge was content not to see harry's glum face in his class and to leave him to read and sulk for himself in his own chamber <\s>
<s> a poem or two in latin and english which were pronounced to have some merit and a latin oration for mr <\s>
<s> esmond could write that language better than pronounce it got him a little reputation both with the authorities of the university and amongst the young men with whom he began to pass for more than he was worth <\s>
<s> a few victories over their common enemy mr <\s>
<s> bridge made them incline towards him and look upon him as the champion of their order against the seniors <\s>
<s> such of the lads as he took into his confidence found him not so gloomy and haughty as his appearance led them to believe and don dismallo as he was called became presently a person of some little importance in his college and was as he believes set down by the seniors there as rather a dangerous character <\s>
<s> don dismallo was a staunch young jacobite like the rest of his family gave himself many absurd airs of loyalty used to invite young friends to burgundy and give the king's health on king james's birthday wore black on the day of his abdication fasted on the anniversary of king william's coronation and performed a thousand absurd antics of which he smiles now to think <\s>
<s> these follies caused many remonstrances on tom tusher's part who was always a friend to the powers that be as esmond was always in opposition to them <\s>
<s> tom was a whig while esmond was a tory <\s>
<s> tom never missed a lecture and capped the proctor with the profoundest of bows <\s>
<s> no wonder he sighed over harry's insubordinate courses and was angry when the others laughed at him <\s>
<s> but that harry was known to have my lord viscount's protection tom no doubt would have broken with him altogether <\s>
<s> but honest tom never gave up a comrade as long as he was the friend of a great man <\s>
<s> this was not out of scheming on tom's part but a natural inclination towards the great <\s>
<s> twas no hypocrisy in him to flatter but the bent of his mind which was always perfectly good humored obliging and servile <\s>
<s> harry had very liberal allowances for his dear mistress of castlewood not only regularly supplied him but the dowager of chelsey made her donation annual and received esmond at her house near london every christmas but in spite of these benefactions esmond was constantly poor whilst twas a wonder with how small a stipend from his father tom tusher contrived to make a good figure <\s>
<s> tis true that harry both spent gave and lent his money very freely which thomas never did <\s>
<s> i think he was like the famous duke of marlborough in this instance who getting a present of fifty pieces when a young man from some foolish woman who fell in love with his good looks showed the money to cadogan in a drawer scores of years after where it had lain ever since he had sold his beardless honor to procure it <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that tom ever let out his good looks so profitably for nature had not endowed him with any particular charms of person and he ever was a pattern of moral behavior losing no opportunity of giving the very best advice to his younger comrade with which article to do him justice he parted very freely <\s>
<s> not but that he was a merry fellow too in his way he loved a joke if by good fortune he understood it and took his share generously of a bottle if another paid for it and especially if there was a young lord in company to drink it <\s>
<s> in these cases there was not a harder drinker in the university than mr <\s>
<s> tusher could be and it was edifying to behold him fresh shaved and with smug face singing out amen <\s>
<s> at early chapel in the morning <\s>
<s> in his reading poor harry permitted himself to go a gadding after all the nine muses and so very likely had but little favor from any one of them whereas tom tusher who had no more turn for poetry than a ploughboy nevertheless by a dogged perseverance and obsequiousness in courting the divine calliope got himself a prize and some credit in the university and a fellowship at his college as a reward for his scholarship <\s>
<s> in this time of mr <\s>
