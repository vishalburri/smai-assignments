<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> if my lady did not speak of her griefs to harry esmond my lord was by no means reserved when in his cups and spoke his mind very freely bidding harry in his coarse way and with his blunt language beware of all women as cheats jades jilts and using other unmistakable monosyllables in speaking of them <\s>
<s> indeed twas the fashion of the day as i must own and there's not a writer of my time of any note with the exception of poor dick steele that does not speak of a woman as of a slave and scorn and use her as such <\s>

<s> when he left her she began to think for herself and her thoughts were not in his favor <\s>
<s> after the illumination when the love lamp is put out that anon we spoke of and by the common daylight we look at the picture what a daub it looks <\s>

<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> tusher was a cross old plague and they did not like to learn from him at all and papa did not care about them learning and laughed when they were at their books but mamma liked them to learn and taught them and i don't think papa is fond of mamma said miss beatrix with her great eyes <\s>

<s> if my lady did not speak of her griefs to harry esmond my lord was by no means reserved when in his cups and spoke his mind very freely bidding harry in his coarse way and with his blunt language beware of all women as cheats jades jilts and using other unmistakable monosyllables in speaking of them <\s>
<s> indeed twas the fashion of the day as i must own and there's not a writer of my time of any note with the exception of poor dick steele that does not speak of a woman as of a slave and scorn and use her as such <\s>

<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> it may be that he made the ill will which he imagined came from them by his own behavior which as he looks back on it in after life he now sees was morose and haughty <\s>
<s> at any rate he was as tenderly grateful for kindness as he was susceptible of slight and wrong and lonely as he was generally yet had one or two very warm friendships for his companions of those days <\s>

<s> tusher was a cross old plague and they did not like to learn from him at all and papa did not care about them learning and laughed when they were at their books but mamma liked them to learn and taught them and i don't think papa is fond of mamma said miss beatrix with her great eyes <\s>

<s> if my lady did not speak of her griefs to harry esmond my lord was by no means reserved when in his cups and spoke his mind very freely bidding harry in his coarse way and with his blunt language beware of all women as cheats jades jilts and using other unmistakable monosyllables in speaking of them <\s>
<s> indeed twas the fashion of the day as i must own and there's not a writer of my time of any note with the exception of poor dick steele that does not speak of a woman as of a slave and scorn and use her as such <\s>

<s> when he left her she began to think for herself and her thoughts were not in his favor <\s>
<s> after the illumination when the love lamp is put out that anon we spoke of and by the common daylight we look at the picture what a daub it looks <\s>

<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> many gentlemen came to stop with papa and papa had gotten a new game from london a french game called a billiard that the french king played it very well and the dowager lady castlewood had sent miss beatrix a present and papa had gotten a new chaise with two little horses which he drove himself beside the coach which mamma went in and dr <\s>
<s> tusher was a cross old plague and they did not like to learn from him at all and papa did not care about them learning and laughed when they were at their books but mamma liked them to learn and taught them and i don't think papa is fond of mamma said miss beatrix with her great eyes <\s>
<s> she had come quite close up to harry esmond by the time this prattle took place and was on his knee and had examined all the points of his dress and all the good or bad features of his homely face <\s>
<s> you shouldn't say that papa is not fond of mamma said the boy at this confession <\s>
<s> mamma never said so and mamma forbade you to say it miss beatrix <\s>

<s> who does not know of eyes lighted by love once where the flame shines no more of lamps extinguished once properly trimmed and tended <\s>
<s> every man has such in his house <\s>
<s> such mementoes make our splendidest chambers look blank and sad such faces seen in a day cast a gloom upon our sunshine <\s>
<s> so oaths mutually sworn and invocations of heaven and priestly ceremonies and fond belief and love so fond and faithful that it never doubted but that it should live for ever are all of no avail towards making love eternal it dies in spite of the banns and the priest and i have often thought there should be a visitation of the sick for it and a funeral service and an extreme unction and an abi in pace <\s>
<s> it has its course like all mortal things its beginning progress and decay <\s>

<s> not all the priests of hymen not all the incantations to the gods can make it whole <\s>
<s> waking up from dreams books and visions of college honors in which for two years harry esmond had been immersed he found himself instantly on his return home in the midst of this actual tragedy of life which absorbed and interested him more than all his tutor had taught him <\s>
<s> the persons whom he loved best in the world and to whom he owed most were living unhappily together <\s>
<s> the gentlest and kindest of women was suffering ill usage and shedding tears in secret the man who made her wretched by neglect if not by violence was harry's benefactor and patron <\s>
<s> in houses where in place of that sacred inmost flame of love there is discord at the centre the whole household becomes hypocritical and each lies to his neighbor <\s>

<s> and wiseacres call this a proper regard of morals and point out baucis and philemon as examples of a good life <\s>
<s> if my lady did not speak of her griefs to harry esmond my lord was by no means reserved when in his cups and spoke his mind very freely bidding harry in his coarse way and with his blunt language beware of all women as cheats jades jilts and using other unmistakable monosyllables in speaking of them <\s>
<s> indeed twas the fashion of the day as i must own and there's not a writer of my time of any note with the exception of poor dick steele that does not speak of a woman as of a slave and scorn and use her as such <\s>
<s> gay every one of em sing in this key each according to his nature and politeness and louder and fouler than all in abuse is dr <\s>
<s> swift who spoke of them as he treated them worst of all <\s>
<s> much of the quarrels and hatred which arise between married people come in my mind from the husband's rage and revolt at discovering that his slave and bedfellow who is to minister to all his wishes and is church sworn to honor and obey him is his superior and that he and not she ought to be the subordinate of the twain and in these controversies i think lay the cause of my lord's anger against his lady <\s>
<s> when he left her she began to think for herself and her thoughts were not in his favor <\s>
<s> after the illumination when the love lamp is put out that anon we spoke of and by the common daylight we look at the picture what a daub it looks <\s>
<s> what a clumsy effigy <\s>
<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>
<s> so the lamp was out in castlewood hall and the lord and lady there saw each other as they were <\s>
<s> with her illness and altered beauty my lord's fire for his wife disappeared with his selfishness and faithlessness her foolish fiction of love and reverence was rent away <\s>

<s> not all the marriage oaths sworn before all the parsons cardinals ministers muftis and rabbins in the world can bind to that monstrous allegiance <\s>
<s> this couple was living apart then the woman happy to be allowed to love and tend her children who were never of her own good will away from her and thankful to have saved such treasures as these out of the wreck in which the better part of her heart went down <\s>
<s> these young ones had had no instructors save their mother and doctor tusher for their theology occasionally and had made more progress than might have been expected under a tutor so indulgent and fond as lady castlewood <\s>
<s> beatrix could sing and dance like a nymph <\s>

<s> she put on a new ribbon to welcome harry esmond made eyes at him and directed her young smiles at him not a little to the amusement of the young man and the joy of her father who laughed his great laugh and encouraged her in her thousand antics <\s>
<s> lady castlewood watched the child gravely and sadly the little one was pert in her replies to her mother yet eager in her protestations of love and promises of amendment and as ready to cry after a little quarrel brought on by her own giddiness until she had won back her mamma's favor as she was to risk the kind lady's displeasure by fresh outbreaks of restless vanity <\s>
<s> esmond's life he got the little reading which he ever could boast of and passed a good part of his days greedily devouring all the books on which he could lay hand <\s>
<s> in this desultory way the works of most of the english french and italian poets came under his eyes and he had a smattering of the spanish tongue likewise besides the ancient languages of which at least of latin he was a tolerable master <\s>
<s> then about midway in his university career he fell to reading for the profession to which worldly prudence rather than inclination called him and was perfectly bewildered in theological controversy <\s>
<s> in the course of his reading which was neither pursued with that seriousness or that devout mind which such a study requires the youth found himself at the end of one month a papist and was about to proclaim his faith the next month a protestant with chillingworth and the third a sceptic with hobbes and bayle <\s>
<s> whereas honest tom tusher never permitted his mind to stray out of the prescribed university path accepted the thirty nine articles with all his heart and would have signed and sworn to other nine and thirty with entire obedience <\s>

<s> tom professed himself albeit a high churchman a strong king william's man whereas harry brought his family tory politics to college with him to which he must add a dangerous admiration for oliver cromwell whose side or king james's by turns he often chose to take in the disputes which the young gentlemen used to hold in each other's rooms where they debated on the state of the nation crowned and deposed kings and toasted past and present heroes and beauties in flagons of college ale <\s>
<s> thus either from the circumstances of his birth or the natural melancholy of his disposition esmond came to live very much by himself during his stay at the university having neither ambition enough to distinguish himself in the college career nor caring to mingle with the mere pleasures and boyish frolics of the students who were for the most part two or three years younger than he <\s>
<s> he fancied that the gentlemen of the common room of his college slighted him on account of his birth and hence kept aloof from their society <\s>
<s> it may be that he made the ill will which he imagined came from them by his own behavior which as he looks back on it in after life he now sees was morose and haughty <\s>
<s> at any rate he was as tenderly grateful for kindness as he was susceptible of slight and wrong and lonely as he was generally yet had one or two very warm friendships for his companions of those days <\s>

<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>

<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>
<s> so the lamp was out in castlewood hall and the lord and lady there saw each other as they were <\s>
<s> with her illness and altered beauty my lord's fire for his wife disappeared with his selfishness and faithlessness her foolish fiction of love and reverence was rent away <\s>
<s> love who is to love what is base and unlovely <\s>
<s> respect who is to respect what is gross and sensual <\s>
<s> not all the marriage oaths sworn before all the parsons cardinals ministers muftis and rabbins in the world can bind to that monstrous allegiance <\s>
<s> this couple was living apart then the woman happy to be allowed to love and tend her children who were never of her own good will away from her and thankful to have saved such treasures as these out of the wreck in which the better part of her heart went down <\s>
<s> these young ones had had no instructors save their mother and doctor tusher for their theology occasionally and had made more progress than might have been expected under a tutor so indulgent and fond as lady castlewood <\s>
<s> beatrix could sing and dance like a nymph <\s>
<s> her voice was her father's delight after dinner <\s>
<s> she ruled over the house with little imperial ways which her parents coaxed and laughed at <\s>
<s> she had long learned the value of her bright eyes and tried experiments in coquetry in corpore vili upon rustics and country squires until she should prepare to conquer the world and the fashion <\s>
<s> she put on a new ribbon to welcome harry esmond made eyes at him and directed her young smiles at him not a little to the amusement of the young man and the joy of her father who laughed his great laugh and encouraged her in her thousand antics <\s>
<s> lady castlewood watched the child gravely and sadly the little one was pert in her replies to her mother yet eager in her protestations of love and promises of amendment and as ready to cry after a little quarrel brought on by her own giddiness until she had won back her mamma's favor as she was to risk the kind lady's displeasure by fresh outbreaks of restless vanity <\s>
<s> esmond's life he got the little reading which he ever could boast of and passed a good part of his days greedily devouring all the books on which he could lay hand <\s>
<s> in this desultory way the works of most of the english french and italian poets came under his eyes and he had a smattering of the spanish tongue likewise besides the ancient languages of which at least of latin he was a tolerable master <\s>
<s> then about midway in his university career he fell to reading for the profession to which worldly prudence rather than inclination called him and was perfectly bewildered in theological controversy <\s>
<s> in the course of his reading which was neither pursued with that seriousness or that devout mind which such a study requires the youth found himself at the end of one month a papist and was about to proclaim his faith the next month a protestant with chillingworth and the third a sceptic with hobbes and bayle <\s>
<s> whereas honest tom tusher never permitted his mind to stray out of the prescribed university path accepted the thirty nine articles with all his heart and would have signed and sworn to other nine and thirty with entire obedience <\s>
<s> harry's wilfulness in this matter and disorderly thoughts and conversation so shocked and afflicted his senior that there grew up a coldness and estrangement between them so that they became scarce more than mere acquaintances from having been intimate friends when they came to college first <\s>
<s> politics ran high too at the university and here also the young men were at variance <\s>
<s> tom professed himself albeit a high churchman a strong king william's man whereas harry brought his family tory politics to college with him to which he must add a dangerous admiration for oliver cromwell whose side or king james's by turns he often chose to take in the disputes which the young gentlemen used to hold in each other's rooms where they debated on the state of the nation crowned and deposed kings and toasted past and present heroes and beauties in flagons of college ale <\s>
<s> thus either from the circumstances of his birth or the natural melancholy of his disposition esmond came to live very much by himself during his stay at the university having neither ambition enough to distinguish himself in the college career nor caring to mingle with the mere pleasures and boyish frolics of the students who were for the most part two or three years younger than he <\s>
<s> he fancied that the gentlemen of the common room of his college slighted him on account of his birth and hence kept aloof from their society <\s>
<s> it may be that he made the ill will which he imagined came from them by his own behavior which as he looks back on it in after life he now sees was morose and haughty <\s>
<s> at any rate he was as tenderly grateful for kindness as he was susceptible of slight and wrong and lonely as he was generally yet had one or two very warm friendships for his companions of those days <\s>
<s> one of these was a queer gentleman that resided in the university though he was no member of it and was the professor of a science scarce recognized in the common course of college education <\s>
<s> this was a french refugee officer who had been driven out of his native country at the time of the protestant persecutions there and who came to cambridge where he taught the science of the small sword and set up a saloon of arms <\s>
<s> though he declared himself a protestant twas said mr <\s>
<s> moreau was a jesuit in disguise indeed he brought very strong recommendations to the tory party which was pretty strong in that university and very likely was one of the many agents whom king james had in this country <\s>
<s> esmond found this gentleman's conversation very much more agreeable and to his taste than the talk of the college divines in the common room he never wearied of moreau's stories of the wars of turenne and conde in which he had borne a part and being familiar with the french tongue from his youth and in a place where but few spoke it his company became very agreeable to the brave old professor of arms whose favorite pupil he was and who made mr <\s>
<s> esmond a very tolerable proficient in the noble science of escrime <\s>
<s> at the next term esmond was to take his degree of bachelor of arts and afterwards in proper season to assume the cassock and bands which his fond mistress would have him wear <\s>
<s> tom tusher himself was a parson and a fellow of his college by this time and harry felt that he would very gladly cede his right to the living of castlewood to tom and that his own calling was in no way to the pulpit <\s>
<s> but as he was bound before all things in the world to his dear mistress at home and knew that a refusal on his part would grieve her he determined to give her no hint of his unwillingness to the clerical office and it was in this unsatisfactory mood of mind that he went to spend the last vacation he should have at castlewood before he took orders <\s>
<s> i come home for a holiday to castlewood and find a skeleton in the house <\s>
<s> at his third long vacation esmond came as usual to castlewood always feeling an eager thrill of pleasure when he found himself once more in the house where he had passed so many years and beheld the kind familiar eyes of his mistress looking upon him <\s>
<s> she and her children out of whose company she scarce ever saw him came to greet him <\s>
<s> miss beatrix was grown so tall that harry did not quite know whether he might kiss her or no and she blushed and held back when he offered that salutation though she took it and even courted it when they were alone <\s>
<s> the young lord was shooting up to be like his gallant father in look though with his mother's kind eyes the lady of castlewood herself seemed grown too since harry saw her in her look more stately in her person fuller in her face still as ever most tender and friendly a greater air of command and decision than had appeared in that guileless sweet countenance which harry remembered so gratefully <\s>
<s> the tone of her voice was so much deeper and sadder when she spoke and welcomed him that it quite startled esmond who looked up at her surprised as she spoke when she withdrew her eyes from him nor did she ever look at him afterwards when his own eyes were gazing upon her <\s>
<s> a something hinting at grief and secret and filling his mind with alarm undefinable seemed to speak with that low thrilling voice of hers and look out of those clear sad eyes <\s>
<s> her greeting to esmond was so cold that it almost pained the lad who would have liked to fall on his knees and kiss the skirt of her robe so fond and ardent was his respect and regard for her and he faltered in answering the questions which she hesitating on her side began to put to him <\s>
<s> was he happy at cambridge <\s>
<s> did he study too hard <\s>
<s> he had grown very tall and looked very well <\s>
<s> he has got a moustache <\s>
<s> cries out master esmond <\s>
<s> why does he not wear a peruke like my lord mohun <\s>
<s> my lord says that nobody wears their own hair <\s>
<s> i believe you will have to occupy your old chamber says my lady <\s>
<s> i hope the housekeeper has got it ready <\s>
<s> why mamma you have been there ten times these three days yourself <\s>
<s> and she cut some flowers which you planted in my garden do you remember ever so many years ago <\s>
<s> when i was quite a little girl cries out miss beatrix on tiptoe <\s>
<s> and mamma put them in your window <\s>
<s> i remember when you grew well after you were ill that you used to like roses said the lady blushing like one of them <\s>
<s> they all conducted harry esmond to his chamber the children running before harry walking by his mistress hand in hand <\s>
<s> the old room had been ornamented and beautified not a little to receive him <\s>
<s> the flowers were in the window in a china vase and there was a fine new counterpane on the bed which chatterbox beatrix said mamma had made too <\s>
<s> a fire was crackling on the hearth although it was june <\s>
<s> my lady thought the room wanted warming everything was done to make him happy and welcome and you are not to be a page any longer but a gentleman and kinsman and to walk with papa and mamma said the children <\s>
<s> and as soon as his dear mistress and children had left him to himself it was with a heart overflowing with love and gratefulness that he flung himself down on his knees by the side of the little bed and asked a blessing upon those who were so kind to him <\s>
<s> the children who are always house tell tales soon made him acquainted with the little history of the house and family <\s>
<s> papa had been to london twice <\s>
<s> papa often went away now <\s>
<s> papa had taken beatrix to westlands where she was taller than sir george harper's second daughter though she was two years older <\s>
<s> papa had taken beatrix and frank both to bellminster where frank had got the better of lord bellminster's son in a boxing match my lord laughing told harry afterwards <\s>
<s> many gentlemen came to stop with papa and papa had gotten a new game from london a french game called a billiard that the french king played it very well and the dowager lady castlewood had sent miss beatrix a present and papa had gotten a new chaise with two little horses which he drove himself beside the coach which mamma went in and dr <\s>
<s> tusher was a cross old plague and they did not like to learn from him at all and papa did not care about them learning and laughed when they were at their books but mamma liked them to learn and taught them and i don't think papa is fond of mamma said miss beatrix with her great eyes <\s>
<s> she had come quite close up to harry esmond by the time this prattle took place and was on his knee and had examined all the points of his dress and all the good or bad features of his homely face <\s>
<s> you shouldn't say that papa is not fond of mamma said the boy at this confession <\s>
<s> mamma never said so and mamma forbade you to say it miss beatrix <\s>
<s> twas this no doubt that accounted for the sadness in lady castlewood's eyes and the plaintive vibrations of her voice <\s>
<s> who does not know of eyes lighted by love once where the flame shines no more of lamps extinguished once properly trimmed and tended <\s>
<s> every man has such in his house <\s>
<s> such mementoes make our splendidest chambers look blank and sad such faces seen in a day cast a gloom upon our sunshine <\s>
<s> so oaths mutually sworn and invocations of heaven and priestly ceremonies and fond belief and love so fond and faithful that it never doubted but that it should live for ever are all of no avail towards making love eternal it dies in spite of the banns and the priest and i have often thought there should be a visitation of the sick for it and a funeral service and an extreme unction and an abi in pace <\s>
<s> it has its course like all mortal things its beginning progress and decay <\s>
<s> it buds and it blooms out into sunshine and it withers and ends <\s>
<s> strephon and chloe languish apart join in a rapture and presently you hear that chloe is crying and strephon has broken his crook across her back <\s>
<s> can you mend it so as to show no marks of rupture <\s>
<s> not all the priests of hymen not all the incantations to the gods can make it whole <\s>
<s> waking up from dreams books and visions of college honors in which for two years harry esmond had been immersed he found himself instantly on his return home in the midst of this actual tragedy of life which absorbed and interested him more than all his tutor had taught him <\s>
<s> the persons whom he loved best in the world and to whom he owed most were living unhappily together <\s>
<s> the gentlest and kindest of women was suffering ill usage and shedding tears in secret the man who made her wretched by neglect if not by violence was harry's benefactor and patron <\s>
<s> in houses where in place of that sacred inmost flame of love there is discord at the centre the whole household becomes hypocritical and each lies to his neighbor <\s>
<s> the husband or it may be the wife lies when the visitor comes in and wears a grin of reconciliation or politeness before him <\s>
<s> the wife lies indeed her business is to do that and to smile however much she is beaten swallows her tears and lies to her lord and master lies in bidding little jackey respect dear papa lies in assuring grandpapa that she is perfectly happy <\s>
<s> the servants lie wearing grave faces behind their master's chair and pretending to be unconscious of the fighting and so from morning till bedtime life is passed in falsehood <\s>
<s> and wiseacres call this a proper regard of morals and point out baucis and philemon as examples of a good life <\s>
<s> if my lady did not speak of her griefs to harry esmond my lord was by no means reserved when in his cups and spoke his mind very freely bidding harry in his coarse way and with his blunt language beware of all women as cheats jades jilts and using other unmistakable monosyllables in speaking of them <\s>
<s> indeed twas the fashion of the day as i must own and there's not a writer of my time of any note with the exception of poor dick steele that does not speak of a woman as of a slave and scorn and use her as such <\s>
<s> gay every one of em sing in this key each according to his nature and politeness and louder and fouler than all in abuse is dr <\s>
<s> swift who spoke of them as he treated them worst of all <\s>
<s> much of the quarrels and hatred which arise between married people come in my mind from the husband's rage and revolt at discovering that his slave and bedfellow who is to minister to all his wishes and is church sworn to honor and obey him is his superior and that he and not she ought to be the subordinate of the twain and in these controversies i think lay the cause of my lord's anger against his lady <\s>
<s> when he left her she began to think for herself and her thoughts were not in his favor <\s>
<s> after the illumination when the love lamp is put out that anon we spoke of and by the common daylight we look at the picture what a daub it looks <\s>
<s> what a clumsy effigy <\s>
<s> how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you <\s>
<s> and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honor a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humor should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory <\s>
