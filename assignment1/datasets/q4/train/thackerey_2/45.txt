<s> out of the window of the tavern and looking over the garden wall you can see the green before kensington palace the palace gate round which the ministers coaches were standing and the barrack building <\s>
<s> as we were looking out from this window in gloomy discourse we heard presently trumpets blowing and some of us ran to the window of the front room looking into the high street of kensington and saw a regiment of horse coming <\s>
<s> it's ormonde's guards says one <\s>
<s> no by god it's argyle's old regiment <\s>
<s> says my general clapping down his crutch <\s>
<s> it was indeed argyle's regiment that was brought from westminster and that took the place of the regiment at kensington on which we could rely <\s>
<s> says one of the generals there present you were born under an unlucky star i begin to think that there's no mr <\s>
<s> tis not the peerage i care for for our name is so ancient and famous that merely to be called lord lydiard would do me no good but tis the chance you promised me of fighting marlborough <\s>
<s> as we were talking castlewood entered the room with a disturbed air <\s>
<s> george coming at last <\s>
<s> damn him look here <\s>
<s> says castlewood holding out a paper <\s>
<s> i found it in the book the what you call it eikum basilikum that villain martin put it there he said his young mistress bade him <\s>
<s> it was directed to me but it was meant for him i know and i broke the seal and read it <\s>
<s> the whole assembly of officers seemed to swim away before esmond's eyes as he read the paper all that was written on it was beatrix esmond is sent away to prison to castlewood where she will pray for happier days <\s>
<s> can you guess where he is <\s>
<s> yes says colonel esmond <\s>
<s> he knew full well frank knew full well our instinct told whither that traitor had fled <\s>
<s> he had courage to turn to the company and say gentlemen i fear very much that mr <\s>
<s> george will not be here to day something hath happened and and i very much fear some accident may befall him which must keep him out of the way <\s>
<s> having had your noon's draught you had best pay the reckoning and go home there can be no game where there is no one to play it <\s>
<s> some of the gentlemen went away without a word others called to pay their duty to her majesty and ask for her health <\s>
<s> the little army disappeared into the darkness out of which it had been called there had been no writings no paper to implicate any man <\s>
<s> the worthy prelate came out from the conference with an air of great satisfaction he was a man full of resources and of a most assured fidelity and possessed of genius and a hundred good qualities but captious and of a most jealous temper that could not help exulting at the downfall of any favorite and he was pleased in spite of himself to hear that the esmond ministry was at an end <\s>
<s> i have soothed your guest says he coming out to the two gentlemen and the widow who had been made acquainted with somewhat of the dispute of the night before <\s>
<s> by the version we gave her the prince was only made to exhibit anger because we doubted of his intentions in respect to beatrix and to leave us because we questioned his honor but i think all things considered tis as well he should leave this house and then my lady castlewood says the bishop my pretty beatrix may come back to it <\s>
<s> she is quite as well at home at castlewood esmond's mistress said till everything is over <\s>
<s> you shall have your title esmond that i promise you says the good bishop assuming the airs of a prime minister <\s>
<s> the prince hath expressed himself most nobly in regard of the little difference of last night and i promise you he hath listened to my sermon as well as to that of other folks says the doctor archly he hath every great and generous quality with perhaps a weakness for the sex which belongs to his family and hath been known in scores of popular sovereigns from king david downwards <\s>
<s> my lord my lord <\s>
<s> breaks out lady esmond the levity with which you speak of such conduct towards our sex shocks me and what you call weakness i call deplorable sin <\s>
<s> sin it is my dear creature says the bishop with a shrug taking snuff but consider what a sinner king solomon was and in spite of a thousand of wives too <\s>
<s> enough of this my lord says lady castlewood with a fine blush and walked out of the room very stately <\s>
<s> the prince entered it presently with a smile on his face and if he felt any offence against us on the previous night at present exhibited none <\s>
<s> he offered a hand to each gentleman with great courtesy <\s>
<s> if all your bishops preach so well as doctor atterbury <\s>
<s> says he i don't know gentlemen what may happen to me <\s>
<s> i spoke very hastily my lords last night and ask pardon of both of you <\s>
<s> but i must not stay any longer says he giving umbrage to good friends or keeping pretty girls away from their homes <\s>
<s> my lord bishop hath found a safe place for me hard by at a curate's house whom the bishop can trust and whose wife is so ugly as to be beyond all danger we will decamp into those new quarters and i leave you thanking you for a hundred kindnesses here <\s>
<s> where is my hostess that i may bid her farewell to welcome her in a house of my own soon i trust where my friends shall have no cause to quarrel with me <\s>
<s> lady castlewood arrived presently blushing with great grace and tears filling her eyes as the prince graciously saluted her <\s>
<s> she looked so charming and young that the doctor in his bantering way could not help speaking of her beauty to the prince whose compliment made her blush and look more charming still <\s>
<s> a great scheme and who balked it <\s>
<s> as characters written with a secret ink come out with the application of fire and disappear again and leave the paper white as soon as it is cool a hundred names of men high in repute and favoring the prince's cause that were writ in our private lists would have been visible enough on the great roll of the conspiracy had it ever been laid open under the sun <\s>
<s> what crowds would have pressed forward and subscribed their names and protested their loyalty when the danger was over <\s>
<s> what a number of whigs now high in place and creatures of the all powerful minister scorned mr <\s>
<s> if ever a match was gained by the manliness and decision of a few at a moment of danger if ever one was lost by the treachery and imbecility of those that had the cards in their hands and might have played them it was in that momentous game which was enacted in the next three days and of which the noblest crown in the world was the stake <\s>
<s> from the conduct of my lord bolingbroke those who were interested in the scheme we had in hand saw pretty well that he was not to be trusted <\s>
<s> should the prince prevail it was his lordship's gracious intention to declare for him should the hanoverian party bring in their sovereign who more ready to go on his knee and cry god save king george <\s>
<s> and he betrayed the one prince and the other but exactly at the wrong time <\s>
<s> when he should have struck for king james he faltered and coquetted with the whigs and having committed himself by the most monstrous professions of devotion which the elector rightly scorned he proved the justness of their contempt for him by flying and taking renegade service with st <\s>
<s> germains just when he should have kept aloof and that court despised him as the manly and resolute men who established the elector in england had before done <\s>
<s> he signed his own name to every accusation of insincerity his enemies made against him and the king and the pretender alike could show proofs of st <\s>
<s> john's treachery under his own hand and seal <\s>
<s> our friends kept a pretty close watch upon his motions as on those of the brave and hearty whig party that made little concealment of theirs <\s>
<s> they would have in the elector and used every means in their power to effect their end <\s>
<s> my lord marlborough was now with them <\s>
<s> his expulsion from power by the tories had thrown that great captain at once on the whig side <\s>
<s> we heard he was coming from antwerp and in fact on the day of the queen's death he once more landed on english shore <\s>
<s> a great part of the army was always with their illustrious leader even the tories in it were indignant at the injustice of the persecution which the whig officers were made to undergo <\s>
<s> the chiefs of these were in london and at the head of them one of the most intrepid men in the world the scots duke of argyle whose conduct on the second day after that to which i have now brought down my history ended as such honesty and bravery deserved to end by establishing the present royal race on the english throne <\s>
<s> meanwhile there was no slight difference of opinion amongst the councillors surrounding the prince as to the plan his highness should pursue <\s>
<s> his female minister at court fancying she saw some amelioration in the queen was for waiting a few days or hours it might be until he could be brought to her bedside and acknowledged as her heir <\s>
<s> esmond was for having him march thither escorted by a couple of troops of horse guards and openly presenting himself to the council <\s>
<s> during the whole of the night of the 29th 30th july the colonel was engaged with gentlemen of the military profession whom tis needless here to name suffice it to say that several of them had exceeding high rank in the army and one of them in especial was a general who when he heard the duke of marlborough was coming on the other side waved his crutch over his head with a huzzah at the idea that he should march out and engage him <\s>
<s> of the three secretaries of state we knew that one was devoted to us <\s>
<s> the governor of the tower was ours the two companies on duty at kensington barrack were safe and we had intelligence very speedy and accurate of all that took place at the palace within <\s>
<s> at noon on the 30th of july a message came to the prince's friends that the committee of council was sitting at kensington palace their graces of ormonde and shrewsbury the archbishop of canterbury and the three secretaries of state being there assembled <\s>
<s> in an hour afterwards hurried news was brought that the two great whig dukes argyle and somerset had broke into the council chamber without a summons and taken their seat at table <\s>
<s> after holding a debate there the whole party proceeded to the chamber of the queen who was lying in great weakness but still sensible and the lords recommended his grace of shrewsbury as the fittest person to take the vacant place of lord treasurer her majesty gave him the staff as all know <\s>
<s> and now writ my messenger from court now or never is the time <\s>
<s> now or never was the time indeed <\s>
<s> in spite of the whig dukes our side had still the majority in the council and esmond to whom the message had been brought the personage at court not being aware that the prince had quitted his lodging in kensington square and esmond's gallant young aide de camp frank castlewood putting on sword and uniform took a brief leave of their dear lady who embraced and blessed them both and went to her chamber to pray for the issue of the great event which was then pending <\s>
<s> castlewood sped to the barrack to give warning to the captain of the guard there and then went to the king's arms tavern at kensington where our friends were assembled having come by parties of twos and threes riding or in coaches and were got together in the upper chamber fifty three of them their servants who had been instructed to bring arms likewise being below in the garden of the tavern where they were served with drink <\s>
