<s> when the army went into winter quarters abroad those of the officers who had interest or money easily got leave of absence and found it much pleasanter to spend their time in pall mall and hyde park than to pass the winter away behind the fortifications of the dreary old flanders towns where the english troops were gathered <\s>
<s> yachts and packets passed daily between the dutch and flemish ports and harwich the roads thence to london and the great inns were crowded with army gentlemen the taverns and ordinaries of the town swarmed with red coats and our great duke's levees at st <\s>

<s> though esmond had been appointed to a lieutenancy in the fusileer regiment of which that celebrated officer brigadier john richmond webb was colonel he had never joined the regiment nor been introduced to its excellent commander though they had made the same campaign together and been engaged in the same battle <\s>
<s> but being aide de camp to general lumley who commanded the division of horse and the army marching to its point of destination on the danube by different routes esmond had not fallen in as yet with his commander and future comrades of the fort and it was in london in golden square where major general webb lodged that captain esmond had the honor of first paying his respects to his friend patron and commander of after days <\s>
<s> those who remember this brilliant and accomplished gentleman may recollect his character upon which he prided himself i think not a little of being the handsomest man in the army a poet who writ a dull copy of verses upon the battle of oudenarde three years after describing webb says to noble danger webb conducts the way his great example all his troops obey before the front the general sternly rides with such an air as mars to battle strides propitious heaven must sure a hero save like paris handsome and like hector brave <\s>
<s> webb thought these verses quite as fine as mr <\s>
<s> addison's on the blenheim campaign and indeed to be hector a la mode de paris was part of this gallant gentleman's ambition <\s>
<s> it would have been difficult to find an officer in the whole army or amongst the splendid courtiers and cavaliers of the maison du roy that fought under vendosme and villeroy in the army opposed to ours who was a more accomplished soldier and perfect gentleman and either braver or better looking <\s>
<s> webb believed of himself what the world said of him and was deeply convinced of his own indisputable genius beauty and valor who has a right to quarrel with him very much <\s>
<s> this self content of his kept him in general good humor of which his friends and dependants got the benefit <\s>
<s> he came of a very ancient wiltshire family which he respected above all families in the world he could prove a lineal descent from king edward the first and his first ancestor roaldus de richmond rode by william the conqueror's side on hastings field <\s>
<s> we were gentlemen esmond he used to say when the churchills were horse boys <\s>
<s> he was a very tall man standing in his pumps six feet three inches in his great jack boots with his tall fair periwig and hat and feather he could not have been less than eight feet high <\s>
<s> i am taller than churchill he would say surveying himself in the glass and i am a better made man and if the women won't like a man that hasn't a wart on his nose faith i can't help myself and churchill has the better of me there <\s>
<s> indeed he was always measuring himself with the duke and always asking his friends to measure them <\s>
<s> and talking in this frank way as he would do over his cups wags would laugh and encourage him friends would be sorry for him schemers and flatterers would egg him on and tale bearers carry the stories to headquarters and widen the difference which already existed there between the great captain and one of the ablest and bravest lieutenants he ever had <\s>
<s> his rancor against the duke was so apparent that one saw it in the first half hour's conversation with general webb and his lady who adored her general and thought him a hundred times taller handsomer and braver than a prodigal nature had made him hated the great duke with such an intensity as it becomes faithful wives to feel against their husbands enemies <\s>
<s> not that my lord duke was so yet mr <\s>
<s> webb had said a thousand things against him which his superior had pardoned and his grace whose spies were everywhere had heard a thousand things more that webb had never said <\s>
<s> but it cost this great man no pains to pardon and he passed over an injury or a benefit alike easily <\s>
<s> should any child of mine take the pains to read these his ancestor's memoirs i would not have him judge of the great duke by what a contemporary has written of him <\s>
<s> no man hath been so immensely lauded and decried as this great statesman and warrior as indeed no man ever deserved better the very greatest praise and the strongest censure <\s>
<s> if the present writer joins with the latter faction very likely a private pique of his own may be the cause of his ill feeling <\s>
<s> this passage in the memoirs of esmond is written on a leaf inserted into the ms <\s>
<s> book and dated 1744 probably after he had heard of the duchess's death <\s>
<s> on presenting himself at the commander in chief's levee his grace had not the least remembrance of general lumley's aide de camp and though he knew esmond's family perfectly well having served with both lords my lord francis and the viscount esmond's father in flanders and in the duke of york's guard the duke of marlborough who was friendly and serviceable to the so styled legitimate representatives of the viscount castlewood took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant who bore their name <\s>
<s> a word of kindness or acknowledgment or a single glance of approbation might have changed esmond's opinion of the great man and instead of a satire which his pen cannot help writing who knows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of panegyric <\s>
<s> we have but to change the point of view and the greatest action looks mean as we turn the perspective glass and a giant appears a pigmy <\s>
<s> you may describe but who can tell whether your sight is clear or not or your means of information accurate <\s>
<s> had the great man said but a word of kindness to the small one as he would have stepped out of his gilt chariot to shake hands with lazarus in rags and sores if he thought lazarus could have been of any service to him no doubt esmond would have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might but my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment and so muscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition <\s>
<s> so it was however that a young gentleman who in the eyes of his family and in his own doubtless was looked upon as a consummate hero found that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than of the smallest drummer in his grace's army <\s>
<s> the dowager at chelsey was furious against this neglect of her family and had a great battle with lady marlborough as lady castlewood insisted on calling the duchess <\s>
<s> her grace was now mistress of the robes to her majesty and one of the greatest personages in this kingdom as her husband was in all europe and the battle between the two ladies took place in the queen's drawing room <\s>
<s> the duchess in reply to my aunt's eager clamor said haughtily that she had done her best for the legitimate branch of the esmonds and could not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family <\s>
<s> says the viscountess in a fury <\s>
<s> there are bastards among the churchills as your grace knows and the duke of berwick is provided for well enough <\s>
<s> madam says the duchess you know whose fault it is that there are no such dukes in the esmond family too and how that little scheme of a certain lady miscarried <\s>
<s> esmond's friend dick steele who was in waiting on the prince heard the controversy between the ladies at court <\s>
<s> and faith says dick i think harry thy kinswoman had the worst of it <\s>
<s> he could not keep the story quiet twas all over the coffee houses ere night it was printed in a news letter before a month was over and the reply of her grace the duchess of m rlb r gh to a popish lady of the court once a favorite of the late k j m s was printed in half a dozen places with a note stating that this duchess when the head of this lady's family came by his death lately in a fatal duel never rested until she got a pension for the orphan heir and widow from her majesty's bounty <\s>
<s> the squabble did not advance poor esmond's promotion much and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show his face at the commander in chief's levees again <\s>
<s> during those eighteen months which had passed since esmond saw his dear mistress her good father the old dean quitted this life firm in his principles to the very last and enjoining his family always to remember that the queen's brother king james the third was their rightful sovereign <\s>
<s> he made a very edifying end as his daughter told esmond and not a little to her surprise after his death for he had lived always very poorly my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than 3,000 l <\s>
<s> behind him which he bequeathed to her <\s>
<s> with this little fortune lady castlewood was enabled when her daughter's turn at court came to come to london where she took a small genteel house at kensington in the neighborhood of the court bringing her children with her and here it was that esmond found his friends <\s>
<s> as for the young lord his university career had ended rather abruptly <\s>
<s> honest tusher his governor had found my young gentleman quite ungovernable <\s>

<s> after the great victory of blenheim the enthusiasm of the army for the duke even of his bitterest personal enemies in it amounted to a sort of rage nay the very officers who cursed him in their hearts were among the most frantic to cheer him <\s>
<s> who could refuse his meed of admiration to such a victory and such a victor <\s>
<s> not he who writes a man may profess to be ever so much a philosopher but he who fought on that day must feel a thrill of pride as he recalls it <\s>
<s> the french right was posted near to the village of blenheim on the danube where the marshal tallard's quarters were their line extending through it may be a league and a half before lutzingen and up to a woody hill round the base of which and acting against the prince of savoy were forty of his squadrons <\s>
<s> here was a village that the frenchmen had burned the wood being in fact a better shelter and easier of guard than any village <\s>
<s> before these two villages and the french lines ran a little stream not more than two foot broad through a marsh that was mostly dried up from the heats of the weather and this stream was the only separation between the two armies ours coming up and ranging themselves in line of battle before the french at six o'clock in the morning so that our line was quite visible to theirs and the whole of this great plain was black and swarming with troops for hours before the cannonading began <\s>
<s> on one side and the other this cannonading lasted many hours <\s>
<s> the french guns being in position in front of their line and doing severe damage among our horse especially and on our right wing of imperialists under the prince of savoy who could neither advance his artillery nor his lines the ground before him being cut up by ditches morasses and very difficult of passage for the guns <\s>
<s> it was past mid day when the attack began on our left where lord cutts commanded the bravest and most beloved officer in the english army <\s>
<s> and now as if to make his experience in war complete our young aide de camp having seen two great armies facing each other in line of battle and had the honor of riding with orders from one end to other of the line came in for a not uncommon accompaniment of military glory and was knocked on the head along with many hundred of brave fellows almost at the very commencement of this famous day of blenheim <\s>
<s> a little after noon the disposition for attack being completed with much delay and difficulty and under a severe fire from the enemy's guns that were better posted and more numerous than ours a body of english and hessians with major general wilkes commanding at the extreme left of our line marched upon blenheim advancing with great gallantry the major general on foot with his officers at the head of the column and marching with his hat off intrepidly in the face of the enemy who was pouring in a tremendous fire from his guns and musketry to which our people were instructed not to reply except with pike and bayonet when they reached the french palisades <\s>
<s> to these wilkes walked intrepidly and struck the woodwork with his sword before our people charged it <\s>
<s> he was shot down at the instant with his colonel major and several officers and our troops cheering and huzzaing and coming on as they did with immense resolution and gallantry were nevertheless stopped by the murderous fire from behind the enemy's defences and then attacked in flank by a furious charge of french horse which swept out of blenheim and cut down our men in great numbers <\s>
<s> three fierce and desperate assaults of our foot were made and repulsed by the enemy so that our columns of foot were quite shattered and fell back scrambling over the little rivulet which we had crossed so resolutely an hour before and pursued by the french cavalry slaughtering us and cutting us down <\s>
<s> and now the conquerors were met by a furious charge of english horse under esmond's general general lumley behind whose squadrons the flying foot found refuge and formed again whilst lumley drove back the french horse charging up to the village of blenheim and the palisades where wilkes and many hundred more gallant englishmen lay in slaughtered heaps <\s>
<s> beyond this moment and of this famous victory mr <\s>
<s> esmond knows nothing for a shot brought down his horse and our young gentleman on it who fell crushed and stunned under the animal and came to his senses he knows not how long after only to lose them again from pain and loss of blood <\s>
<s> a dim sense as of people groaning round about him a wild incoherent thought or two for her who occupied so much of his heart now and that here his career and his hopes and misfortunes were ended he remembers in the course of these hours <\s>
<s> when he woke up it was with a pang of extreme pain his breastplate was taken off his servant was holding his head up the good and faithful lad of hampshire was blubbering over his master whom he found and had thought dead and a surgeon was probing a wound in the shoulder which he must have got at the same moment when his horse was shot and fell over him <\s>
<s> the battle was over at this end of the field by this time the village was in possession of the english its brave defenders prisoners or fled or drowned many of them in the neighboring waters of donau <\s>
<s> but for honest lockwood's faithful search after his master there had no doubt been an end of esmond here and of this his story <\s>
<s> the marauders were out riffling the bodies as they lay on the field and jack had brained one of these gentry with the club end of his musket who had eased esmond of his hat and periwig his purse and fine silver mounted pistols which the dowager gave him and was fumbling in his pockets for further treasure when jack lockwood came up and put an end to the scoundrel's triumph <\s>
<s> my mistress before i went this campaign sent me john lockwood out of walcote who hath ever since remained with me h <\s>
<s> hospitals for our wounded were established at blenheim and here for several weeks esmond lay in very great danger of his life the wound was not very great from which he suffered and the ball extracted by the surgeon on the spot where our young gentleman received it but a fever set in next day as he was lying in hospital and that almost carried him away <\s>
<s> jack lockwood said he talked in the wildest manner during his delirium that he called himself the marquis of esmond and seizing one of the surgeon's assistants who came to dress his wounds swore that he was madam beatrix and that he would make her a duchess if she would but say yes <\s>
<s> he was passing the days in these crazy fancies and vana somnia whilst the army was singing te deum for the victory and those famous festivities were taking place at which our duke now made a prince of the empire was entertained by the king of the romans and his nobility <\s>
<s> his grace went home by berlin and hanover and esmond lost the festivities which took place at those cities and which his general shared in company of the other general officers who travelled with our great captain <\s>
<s> when he could move it was by the duke of wurtemberg's city of stuttgard that he made his way homewards revisiting heidelberg again whence he went to manheim and hence had a tedious but easy water journey down the river of rhine which he had thought a delightful and beautiful voyage indeed but that his heart was longing for home and something far more beautiful and delightful <\s>
<s> as bright and welcome as the eyes almost of his mistress shone the lights of harwich as the packet came in from holland <\s>
<s> it was not many hours ere he esmond was in london of that you may be sure and received with open arms by the old dowager of chelsey who vowed in her jargon of french and english that he had the air noble that his pallor embellished him that he was an amadis and deserved a gloriana and oh <\s>
<s> what was his joy at hearing that his mistress was come into waiting and was now with her majesty at kensington <\s>
<s> esmond had told jack lockwood to get horses and they would ride for winchester that night when he heard this news he countermanded the horses at once his business lay no longer in hants all his hope and desire lay within a couple of miles of him in kensington park wall <\s>

<s> those who remember this brilliant and accomplished gentleman may recollect his character upon which he prided himself i think not a little of being the handsomest man in the army a poet who writ a dull copy of verses upon the battle of oudenarde three years after describing webb says to noble danger webb conducts the way his great example all his troops obey before the front the general sternly rides with such an air as mars to battle strides propitious heaven must sure a hero save like paris handsome and like hector brave <\s>
<s> webb thought these verses quite as fine as mr <\s>
<s> addison's on the blenheim campaign and indeed to be hector a la mode de paris was part of this gallant gentleman's ambition <\s>
<s> it would have been difficult to find an officer in the whole army or amongst the splendid courtiers and cavaliers of the maison du roy that fought under vendosme and villeroy in the army opposed to ours who was a more accomplished soldier and perfect gentleman and either braver or better looking <\s>
<s> webb believed of himself what the world said of him and was deeply convinced of his own indisputable genius beauty and valor who has a right to quarrel with him very much <\s>
<s> this self content of his kept him in general good humor of which his friends and dependants got the benefit <\s>
<s> he came of a very ancient wiltshire family which he respected above all families in the world he could prove a lineal descent from king edward the first and his first ancestor roaldus de richmond rode by william the conqueror's side on hastings field <\s>
<s> we were gentlemen esmond he used to say when the churchills were horse boys <\s>
<s> he was a very tall man standing in his pumps six feet three inches in his great jack boots with his tall fair periwig and hat and feather he could not have been less than eight feet high <\s>
<s> i am taller than churchill he would say surveying himself in the glass and i am a better made man and if the women won't like a man that hasn't a wart on his nose faith i can't help myself and churchill has the better of me there <\s>
<s> indeed he was always measuring himself with the duke and always asking his friends to measure them <\s>
<s> and talking in this frank way as he would do over his cups wags would laugh and encourage him friends would be sorry for him schemers and flatterers would egg him on and tale bearers carry the stories to headquarters and widen the difference which already existed there between the great captain and one of the ablest and bravest lieutenants he ever had <\s>
<s> his rancor against the duke was so apparent that one saw it in the first half hour's conversation with general webb and his lady who adored her general and thought him a hundred times taller handsomer and braver than a prodigal nature had made him hated the great duke with such an intensity as it becomes faithful wives to feel against their husbands enemies <\s>
<s> not that my lord duke was so yet mr <\s>
<s> webb had said a thousand things against him which his superior had pardoned and his grace whose spies were everywhere had heard a thousand things more that webb had never said <\s>
<s> but it cost this great man no pains to pardon and he passed over an injury or a benefit alike easily <\s>
<s> should any child of mine take the pains to read these his ancestor's memoirs i would not have him judge of the great duke by what a contemporary has written of him <\s>
<s> no man hath been so immensely lauded and decried as this great statesman and warrior as indeed no man ever deserved better the very greatest praise and the strongest censure <\s>
<s> if the present writer joins with the latter faction very likely a private pique of his own may be the cause of his ill feeling <\s>
<s> this passage in the memoirs of esmond is written on a leaf inserted into the ms <\s>
<s> book and dated 1744 probably after he had heard of the duchess's death <\s>
<s> on presenting himself at the commander in chief's levee his grace had not the least remembrance of general lumley's aide de camp and though he knew esmond's family perfectly well having served with both lords my lord francis and the viscount esmond's father in flanders and in the duke of york's guard the duke of marlborough who was friendly and serviceable to the so styled legitimate representatives of the viscount castlewood took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant who bore their name <\s>
<s> a word of kindness or acknowledgment or a single glance of approbation might have changed esmond's opinion of the great man and instead of a satire which his pen cannot help writing who knows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of panegyric <\s>
<s> we have but to change the point of view and the greatest action looks mean as we turn the perspective glass and a giant appears a pigmy <\s>
<s> you may describe but who can tell whether your sight is clear or not or your means of information accurate <\s>
<s> had the great man said but a word of kindness to the small one as he would have stepped out of his gilt chariot to shake hands with lazarus in rags and sores if he thought lazarus could have been of any service to him no doubt esmond would have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might but my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment and so muscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition <\s>
<s> so it was however that a young gentleman who in the eyes of his family and in his own doubtless was looked upon as a consummate hero found that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than of the smallest drummer in his grace's army <\s>
<s> the dowager at chelsey was furious against this neglect of her family and had a great battle with lady marlborough as lady castlewood insisted on calling the duchess <\s>
<s> her grace was now mistress of the robes to her majesty and one of the greatest personages in this kingdom as her husband was in all europe and the battle between the two ladies took place in the queen's drawing room <\s>
<s> the duchess in reply to my aunt's eager clamor said haughtily that she had done her best for the legitimate branch of the esmonds and could not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family <\s>
<s> says the viscountess in a fury <\s>
<s> there are bastards among the churchills as your grace knows and the duke of berwick is provided for well enough <\s>
<s> madam says the duchess you know whose fault it is that there are no such dukes in the esmond family too and how that little scheme of a certain lady miscarried <\s>
<s> esmond's friend dick steele who was in waiting on the prince heard the controversy between the ladies at court <\s>
<s> and faith says dick i think harry thy kinswoman had the worst of it <\s>
<s> he could not keep the story quiet twas all over the coffee houses ere night it was printed in a news letter before a month was over and the reply of her grace the duchess of m rlb r gh to a popish lady of the court once a favorite of the late k j m s was printed in half a dozen places with a note stating that this duchess when the head of this lady's family came by his death lately in a fatal duel never rested until she got a pension for the orphan heir and widow from her majesty's bounty <\s>
<s> the squabble did not advance poor esmond's promotion much and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show his face at the commander in chief's levees again <\s>
<s> during those eighteen months which had passed since esmond saw his dear mistress her good father the old dean quitted this life firm in his principles to the very last and enjoining his family always to remember that the queen's brother king james the third was their rightful sovereign <\s>
<s> he made a very edifying end as his daughter told esmond and not a little to her surprise after his death for he had lived always very poorly my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than 3,000 l <\s>
<s> behind him which he bequeathed to her <\s>
<s> with this little fortune lady castlewood was enabled when her daughter's turn at court came to come to london where she took a small genteel house at kensington in the neighborhood of the court bringing her children with her and here it was that esmond found his friends <\s>
<s> as for the young lord his university career had ended rather abruptly <\s>
<s> honest tusher his governor had found my young gentleman quite ungovernable <\s>
<s> why does the stately muse of history that delights in describing the valor of heroes and the grandeur of conquest leave out these scenes so brutal mean and degrading that yet form by far the greater part of the drama of war <\s>
<s> you gentlemen of england who live at home at ease and compliment yourselves in the songs of triumph with which our chieftains are bepraised you pretty maidens that come tumbling down the stairs when the fife and drum call you and huzzah for the british grenadiers do you take account that these items go to make up the amount of the triumph you admire and form part of the duties of the heroes you fondle <\s>
<s> our chief whom england and all europe saving only the frenchmen worshipped almost had this of the godlike in him that he was impassible before victory before danger before defeat <\s>
<s> before the greatest obstacle or the most trivial ceremony before a hundred thousand men drawn in battalia or a peasant slaughtered at the door of his burning hovel before a carouse of drunken german lords or a monarch's court or a cottage table where his plans were laid or an enemy's battery vomiting flame and death and strewing corpses round about him he was always cold calm resolute like fate <\s>
<s> he performed a treason or a court bow he told a falsehood as black as styx as easily as he paid a compliment or spoke about the weather <\s>
<s> he took a mistress and left her he betrayed his benefactor and supported him or would have murdered him with the same calmness always and having no more remorse than clotho when she weaves the thread or lachesis when she cuts it <\s>
<s> in the hour of battle i have heard the prince of savoy's officers say the prince became possessed with a sort of warlike fury his eyes lighted up he rushed hither and thither raging he shrieked curses and encouragement yelling and harking his bloody war dogs on and himself always at the first of the hunt <\s>
<s> our duke was as calm at the mouth of the cannon as at the door of a drawing room <\s>
<s> perhaps he could not have been the great man he was had he had a heart either for love or hatred or pity or fear or regret or remorse <\s>
<s> he achieved the highest deed of daring or deepest calculation of thought as he performed the very meanest action of which a man is capable told a lie or cheated a fond woman or robbed a poor beggar of a halfpenny with a like awful serenity and equal capacity of the highest and lowest acts of our nature <\s>

<s> who could refuse his meed of admiration to such a victory and such a victor <\s>
<s> not he who writes a man may profess to be ever so much a philosopher but he who fought on that day must feel a thrill of pride as he recalls it <\s>
<s> the french right was posted near to the village of blenheim on the danube where the marshal tallard's quarters were their line extending through it may be a league and a half before lutzingen and up to a woody hill round the base of which and acting against the prince of savoy were forty of his squadrons <\s>
<s> here was a village that the frenchmen had burned the wood being in fact a better shelter and easier of guard than any village <\s>
<s> before these two villages and the french lines ran a little stream not more than two foot broad through a marsh that was mostly dried up from the heats of the weather and this stream was the only separation between the two armies ours coming up and ranging themselves in line of battle before the french at six o'clock in the morning so that our line was quite visible to theirs and the whole of this great plain was black and swarming with troops for hours before the cannonading began <\s>
<s> on one side and the other this cannonading lasted many hours <\s>
<s> the french guns being in position in front of their line and doing severe damage among our horse especially and on our right wing of imperialists under the prince of savoy who could neither advance his artillery nor his lines the ground before him being cut up by ditches morasses and very difficult of passage for the guns <\s>
<s> it was past mid day when the attack began on our left where lord cutts commanded the bravest and most beloved officer in the english army <\s>
<s> and now as if to make his experience in war complete our young aide de camp having seen two great armies facing each other in line of battle and had the honor of riding with orders from one end to other of the line came in for a not uncommon accompaniment of military glory and was knocked on the head along with many hundred of brave fellows almost at the very commencement of this famous day of blenheim <\s>
<s> a little after noon the disposition for attack being completed with much delay and difficulty and under a severe fire from the enemy's guns that were better posted and more numerous than ours a body of english and hessians with major general wilkes commanding at the extreme left of our line marched upon blenheim advancing with great gallantry the major general on foot with his officers at the head of the column and marching with his hat off intrepidly in the face of the enemy who was pouring in a tremendous fire from his guns and musketry to which our people were instructed not to reply except with pike and bayonet when they reached the french palisades <\s>
<s> to these wilkes walked intrepidly and struck the woodwork with his sword before our people charged it <\s>
<s> he was shot down at the instant with his colonel major and several officers and our troops cheering and huzzaing and coming on as they did with immense resolution and gallantry were nevertheless stopped by the murderous fire from behind the enemy's defences and then attacked in flank by a furious charge of french horse which swept out of blenheim and cut down our men in great numbers <\s>
<s> three fierce and desperate assaults of our foot were made and repulsed by the enemy so that our columns of foot were quite shattered and fell back scrambling over the little rivulet which we had crossed so resolutely an hour before and pursued by the french cavalry slaughtering us and cutting us down <\s>
<s> and now the conquerors were met by a furious charge of english horse under esmond's general general lumley behind whose squadrons the flying foot found refuge and formed again whilst lumley drove back the french horse charging up to the village of blenheim and the palisades where wilkes and many hundred more gallant englishmen lay in slaughtered heaps <\s>
<s> beyond this moment and of this famous victory mr <\s>
<s> esmond knows nothing for a shot brought down his horse and our young gentleman on it who fell crushed and stunned under the animal and came to his senses he knows not how long after only to lose them again from pain and loss of blood <\s>
<s> a dim sense as of people groaning round about him a wild incoherent thought or two for her who occupied so much of his heart now and that here his career and his hopes and misfortunes were ended he remembers in the course of these hours <\s>
<s> when he woke up it was with a pang of extreme pain his breastplate was taken off his servant was holding his head up the good and faithful lad of hampshire was blubbering over his master whom he found and had thought dead and a surgeon was probing a wound in the shoulder which he must have got at the same moment when his horse was shot and fell over him <\s>
<s> the battle was over at this end of the field by this time the village was in possession of the english its brave defenders prisoners or fled or drowned many of them in the neighboring waters of donau <\s>
<s> but for honest lockwood's faithful search after his master there had no doubt been an end of esmond here and of this his story <\s>
<s> the marauders were out riffling the bodies as they lay on the field and jack had brained one of these gentry with the club end of his musket who had eased esmond of his hat and periwig his purse and fine silver mounted pistols which the dowager gave him and was fumbling in his pockets for further treasure when jack lockwood came up and put an end to the scoundrel's triumph <\s>
<s> my mistress before i went this campaign sent me john lockwood out of walcote who hath ever since remained with me h <\s>
<s> hospitals for our wounded were established at blenheim and here for several weeks esmond lay in very great danger of his life the wound was not very great from which he suffered and the ball extracted by the surgeon on the spot where our young gentleman received it but a fever set in next day as he was lying in hospital and that almost carried him away <\s>
<s> jack lockwood said he talked in the wildest manner during his delirium that he called himself the marquis of esmond and seizing one of the surgeon's assistants who came to dress his wounds swore that he was madam beatrix and that he would make her a duchess if she would but say yes <\s>
<s> he was passing the days in these crazy fancies and vana somnia whilst the army was singing te deum for the victory and those famous festivities were taking place at which our duke now made a prince of the empire was entertained by the king of the romans and his nobility <\s>
<s> his grace went home by berlin and hanover and esmond lost the festivities which took place at those cities and which his general shared in company of the other general officers who travelled with our great captain <\s>
<s> when he could move it was by the duke of wurtemberg's city of stuttgard that he made his way homewards revisiting heidelberg again whence he went to manheim and hence had a tedious but easy water journey down the river of rhine which he had thought a delightful and beautiful voyage indeed but that his heart was longing for home and something far more beautiful and delightful <\s>
<s> as bright and welcome as the eyes almost of his mistress shone the lights of harwich as the packet came in from holland <\s>
<s> it was not many hours ere he esmond was in london of that you may be sure and received with open arms by the old dowager of chelsey who vowed in her jargon of french and english that he had the air noble that his pallor embellished him that he was an amadis and deserved a gloriana and oh <\s>
<s> what was his joy at hearing that his mistress was come into waiting and was now with her majesty at kensington <\s>
<s> esmond had told jack lockwood to get horses and they would ride for winchester that night when he heard this news he countermanded the horses at once his business lay no longer in hants all his hope and desire lay within a couple of miles of him in kensington park wall <\s>
<s> poor harry had never looked in the glass before so eagerly to see whether he had the bel air and his paleness really did become him he never took such pains about the curl of his periwig and the taste of his embroidery and point lace as now before mr <\s>
<s> amadis presented himself to madam gloriana <\s>
<s> was the fire of the french lines half so murderous as the killing glances from her ladyship's eyes <\s>
<s> darts and raptures how beautiful were they <\s>
<s> and as before the blazing sun of morning the moon fades away in the sky almost invisible esmond thought with a blush perhaps of another sweet pale face sad and faint and fading out of sight with its sweet fond gaze of affection such a last look it seemed to cast as eurydice might have given yearning after her lover when fate and pluto summoned her and she passed away into the shades <\s>
<s> an old story about a fool and a woman <\s>
<s> any taste for pleasure which esmond had and he liked to desipere in loco neither more nor less than most young men of his age he could now gratify to the utmost extent and in the best company which the town afforded <\s>
<s> when the army went into winter quarters abroad those of the officers who had interest or money easily got leave of absence and found it much pleasanter to spend their time in pall mall and hyde park than to pass the winter away behind the fortifications of the dreary old flanders towns where the english troops were gathered <\s>
<s> yachts and packets passed daily between the dutch and flemish ports and harwich the roads thence to london and the great inns were crowded with army gentlemen the taverns and ordinaries of the town swarmed with red coats and our great duke's levees at st <\s>

<s> though esmond had been appointed to a lieutenancy in the fusileer regiment of which that celebrated officer brigadier john richmond webb was colonel he had never joined the regiment nor been introduced to its excellent commander though they had made the same campaign together and been engaged in the same battle <\s>

<s> webb thought these verses quite as fine as mr <\s>
<s> addison's on the blenheim campaign and indeed to be hector a la mode de paris was part of this gallant gentleman's ambition <\s>
<s> it would have been difficult to find an officer in the whole army or amongst the splendid courtiers and cavaliers of the maison du roy that fought under vendosme and villeroy in the army opposed to ours who was a more accomplished soldier and perfect gentleman and either braver or better looking <\s>
<s> webb believed of himself what the world said of him and was deeply convinced of his own indisputable genius beauty and valor who has a right to quarrel with him very much <\s>
<s> this self content of his kept him in general good humor of which his friends and dependants got the benefit <\s>
<s> he came of a very ancient wiltshire family which he respected above all families in the world he could prove a lineal descent from king edward the first and his first ancestor roaldus de richmond rode by william the conqueror's side on hastings field <\s>
<s> we were gentlemen esmond he used to say when the churchills were horse boys <\s>
<s> he was a very tall man standing in his pumps six feet three inches in his great jack boots with his tall fair periwig and hat and feather he could not have been less than eight feet high <\s>
<s> i am taller than churchill he would say surveying himself in the glass and i am a better made man and if the women won't like a man that hasn't a wart on his nose faith i can't help myself and churchill has the better of me there <\s>
<s> indeed he was always measuring himself with the duke and always asking his friends to measure them <\s>
<s> and talking in this frank way as he would do over his cups wags would laugh and encourage him friends would be sorry for him schemers and flatterers would egg him on and tale bearers carry the stories to headquarters and widen the difference which already existed there between the great captain and one of the ablest and bravest lieutenants he ever had <\s>
<s> his rancor against the duke was so apparent that one saw it in the first half hour's conversation with general webb and his lady who adored her general and thought him a hundred times taller handsomer and braver than a prodigal nature had made him hated the great duke with such an intensity as it becomes faithful wives to feel against their husbands enemies <\s>
<s> not that my lord duke was so yet mr <\s>
<s> webb had said a thousand things against him which his superior had pardoned and his grace whose spies were everywhere had heard a thousand things more that webb had never said <\s>
<s> but it cost this great man no pains to pardon and he passed over an injury or a benefit alike easily <\s>
<s> should any child of mine take the pains to read these his ancestor's memoirs i would not have him judge of the great duke by what a contemporary has written of him <\s>
<s> no man hath been so immensely lauded and decried as this great statesman and warrior as indeed no man ever deserved better the very greatest praise and the strongest censure <\s>
<s> if the present writer joins with the latter faction very likely a private pique of his own may be the cause of his ill feeling <\s>
<s> this passage in the memoirs of esmond is written on a leaf inserted into the ms <\s>
<s> book and dated 1744 probably after he had heard of the duchess's death <\s>
<s> on presenting himself at the commander in chief's levee his grace had not the least remembrance of general lumley's aide de camp and though he knew esmond's family perfectly well having served with both lords my lord francis and the viscount esmond's father in flanders and in the duke of york's guard the duke of marlborough who was friendly and serviceable to the so styled legitimate representatives of the viscount castlewood took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant who bore their name <\s>
<s> a word of kindness or acknowledgment or a single glance of approbation might have changed esmond's opinion of the great man and instead of a satire which his pen cannot help writing who knows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of panegyric <\s>
<s> we have but to change the point of view and the greatest action looks mean as we turn the perspective glass and a giant appears a pigmy <\s>
<s> you may describe but who can tell whether your sight is clear or not or your means of information accurate <\s>
<s> had the great man said but a word of kindness to the small one as he would have stepped out of his gilt chariot to shake hands with lazarus in rags and sores if he thought lazarus could have been of any service to him no doubt esmond would have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might but my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment and so muscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition <\s>
<s> so it was however that a young gentleman who in the eyes of his family and in his own doubtless was looked upon as a consummate hero found that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than of the smallest drummer in his grace's army <\s>
<s> the dowager at chelsey was furious against this neglect of her family and had a great battle with lady marlborough as lady castlewood insisted on calling the duchess <\s>
<s> her grace was now mistress of the robes to her majesty and one of the greatest personages in this kingdom as her husband was in all europe and the battle between the two ladies took place in the queen's drawing room <\s>
<s> the duchess in reply to my aunt's eager clamor said haughtily that she had done her best for the legitimate branch of the esmonds and could not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family <\s>
<s> says the viscountess in a fury <\s>
<s> there are bastards among the churchills as your grace knows and the duke of berwick is provided for well enough <\s>
<s> madam says the duchess you know whose fault it is that there are no such dukes in the esmond family too and how that little scheme of a certain lady miscarried <\s>
<s> esmond's friend dick steele who was in waiting on the prince heard the controversy between the ladies at court <\s>
<s> and faith says dick i think harry thy kinswoman had the worst of it <\s>
<s> he could not keep the story quiet twas all over the coffee houses ere night it was printed in a news letter before a month was over and the reply of her grace the duchess of m rlb r gh to a popish lady of the court once a favorite of the late k j m s was printed in half a dozen places with a note stating that this duchess when the head of this lady's family came by his death lately in a fatal duel never rested until she got a pension for the orphan heir and widow from her majesty's bounty <\s>
<s> the squabble did not advance poor esmond's promotion much and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show his face at the commander in chief's levees again <\s>
<s> during those eighteen months which had passed since esmond saw his dear mistress her good father the old dean quitted this life firm in his principles to the very last and enjoining his family always to remember that the queen's brother king james the third was their rightful sovereign <\s>
<s> he made a very edifying end as his daughter told esmond and not a little to her surprise after his death for he had lived always very poorly my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than 3,000 l <\s>
<s> behind him which he bequeathed to her <\s>
<s> with this little fortune lady castlewood was enabled when her daughter's turn at court came to come to london where she took a small genteel house at kensington in the neighborhood of the court bringing her children with her and here it was that esmond found his friends <\s>
<s> as for the young lord his university career had ended rather abruptly <\s>
<s> honest tusher his governor had found my young gentleman quite ungovernable <\s>
<s> why does the stately muse of history that delights in describing the valor of heroes and the grandeur of conquest leave out these scenes so brutal mean and degrading that yet form by far the greater part of the drama of war <\s>
<s> you gentlemen of england who live at home at ease and compliment yourselves in the songs of triumph with which our chieftains are bepraised you pretty maidens that come tumbling down the stairs when the fife and drum call you and huzzah for the british grenadiers do you take account that these items go to make up the amount of the triumph you admire and form part of the duties of the heroes you fondle <\s>
<s> our chief whom england and all europe saving only the frenchmen worshipped almost had this of the godlike in him that he was impassible before victory before danger before defeat <\s>
<s> before the greatest obstacle or the most trivial ceremony before a hundred thousand men drawn in battalia or a peasant slaughtered at the door of his burning hovel before a carouse of drunken german lords or a monarch's court or a cottage table where his plans were laid or an enemy's battery vomiting flame and death and strewing corpses round about him he was always cold calm resolute like fate <\s>
<s> he performed a treason or a court bow he told a falsehood as black as styx as easily as he paid a compliment or spoke about the weather <\s>
<s> he took a mistress and left her he betrayed his benefactor and supported him or would have murdered him with the same calmness always and having no more remorse than clotho when she weaves the thread or lachesis when she cuts it <\s>
<s> in the hour of battle i have heard the prince of savoy's officers say the prince became possessed with a sort of warlike fury his eyes lighted up he rushed hither and thither raging he shrieked curses and encouragement yelling and harking his bloody war dogs on and himself always at the first of the hunt <\s>
<s> our duke was as calm at the mouth of the cannon as at the door of a drawing room <\s>
<s> perhaps he could not have been the great man he was had he had a heart either for love or hatred or pity or fear or regret or remorse <\s>
<s> he achieved the highest deed of daring or deepest calculation of thought as he performed the very meanest action of which a man is capable told a lie or cheated a fond woman or robbed a poor beggar of a halfpenny with a like awful serenity and equal capacity of the highest and lowest acts of our nature <\s>
<s> his qualities were pretty well known in the army where there were parties of all politics and of plenty of shrewdness and wit but there existed such a perfect confidence in him as the first captain of the world and such a faith and admiration in his prodigious genius and fortune that the very men whom he notoriously cheated of their pay the chiefs whom he used and injured for he used all men great and small that came near him as his instruments alike and took something of theirs either some quality or some property the blood of a soldier it might be or a jewelled hat or a hundred thousand crowns from a king or a portion out of a starving sentinel's three farthings or when he was young a kiss from a woman and the gold chain off her neck taking all he could from woman or man and having as i have said this of the godlike in him that he could see a hero perish or a sparrow fall with the same amount of sympathy for either <\s>
<s> not that he had no tears he could always order up this reserve at the proper moment to battle he could draw upon tears or smiles alike and whenever need was for using this cheap coin <\s>
<s> he would cringe to a shoeblack as he would flatter a minister or a monarch be haughty be humble threaten repent weep grasp your hand or stab you whenever he saw occasion but yet those of the army who knew him best and had suffered most from him admired him most of all and as he rode along the lines to battle or galloped up in the nick of time to a battalion reeling from before the enemy's charge or shot the fainting men and officers got new courage as they saw the splendid calm of his face and felt that his will made them irresistible <\s>

<s> not he who writes a man may profess to be ever so much a philosopher but he who fought on that day must feel a thrill of pride as he recalls it <\s>

<s> it was past mid day when the attack began on our left where lord cutts commanded the bravest and most beloved officer in the english army <\s>

<s> a little after noon the disposition for attack being completed with much delay and difficulty and under a severe fire from the enemy's guns that were better posted and more numerous than ours a body of english and hessians with major general wilkes commanding at the extreme left of our line marched upon blenheim advancing with great gallantry the major general on foot with his officers at the head of the column and marching with his hat off intrepidly in the face of the enemy who was pouring in a tremendous fire from his guns and musketry to which our people were instructed not to reply except with pike and bayonet when they reached the french palisades <\s>
<s> to these wilkes walked intrepidly and struck the woodwork with his sword before our people charged it <\s>
<s> he was shot down at the instant with his colonel major and several officers and our troops cheering and huzzaing and coming on as they did with immense resolution and gallantry were nevertheless stopped by the murderous fire from behind the enemy's defences and then attacked in flank by a furious charge of french horse which swept out of blenheim and cut down our men in great numbers <\s>
<s> three fierce and desperate assaults of our foot were made and repulsed by the enemy so that our columns of foot were quite shattered and fell back scrambling over the little rivulet which we had crossed so resolutely an hour before and pursued by the french cavalry slaughtering us and cutting us down <\s>
<s> and now the conquerors were met by a furious charge of english horse under esmond's general general lumley behind whose squadrons the flying foot found refuge and formed again whilst lumley drove back the french horse charging up to the village of blenheim and the palisades where wilkes and many hundred more gallant englishmen lay in slaughtered heaps <\s>
<s> beyond this moment and of this famous victory mr <\s>
<s> esmond knows nothing for a shot brought down his horse and our young gentleman on it who fell crushed and stunned under the animal and came to his senses he knows not how long after only to lose them again from pain and loss of blood <\s>
<s> a dim sense as of people groaning round about him a wild incoherent thought or two for her who occupied so much of his heart now and that here his career and his hopes and misfortunes were ended he remembers in the course of these hours <\s>
<s> when he woke up it was with a pang of extreme pain his breastplate was taken off his servant was holding his head up the good and faithful lad of hampshire was blubbering over his master whom he found and had thought dead and a surgeon was probing a wound in the shoulder which he must have got at the same moment when his horse was shot and fell over him <\s>
<s> the battle was over at this end of the field by this time the village was in possession of the english its brave defenders prisoners or fled or drowned many of them in the neighboring waters of donau <\s>
<s> but for honest lockwood's faithful search after his master there had no doubt been an end of esmond here and of this his story <\s>
<s> the marauders were out riffling the bodies as they lay on the field and jack had brained one of these gentry with the club end of his musket who had eased esmond of his hat and periwig his purse and fine silver mounted pistols which the dowager gave him and was fumbling in his pockets for further treasure when jack lockwood came up and put an end to the scoundrel's triumph <\s>
<s> my mistress before i went this campaign sent me john lockwood out of walcote who hath ever since remained with me h <\s>
<s> hospitals for our wounded were established at blenheim and here for several weeks esmond lay in very great danger of his life the wound was not very great from which he suffered and the ball extracted by the surgeon on the spot where our young gentleman received it but a fever set in next day as he was lying in hospital and that almost carried him away <\s>
<s> jack lockwood said he talked in the wildest manner during his delirium that he called himself the marquis of esmond and seizing one of the surgeon's assistants who came to dress his wounds swore that he was madam beatrix and that he would make her a duchess if she would but say yes <\s>
<s> he was passing the days in these crazy fancies and vana somnia whilst the army was singing te deum for the victory and those famous festivities were taking place at which our duke now made a prince of the empire was entertained by the king of the romans and his nobility <\s>
<s> his grace went home by berlin and hanover and esmond lost the festivities which took place at those cities and which his general shared in company of the other general officers who travelled with our great captain <\s>
<s> when he could move it was by the duke of wurtemberg's city of stuttgard that he made his way homewards revisiting heidelberg again whence he went to manheim and hence had a tedious but easy water journey down the river of rhine which he had thought a delightful and beautiful voyage indeed but that his heart was longing for home and something far more beautiful and delightful <\s>
<s> as bright and welcome as the eyes almost of his mistress shone the lights of harwich as the packet came in from holland <\s>
<s> it was not many hours ere he esmond was in london of that you may be sure and received with open arms by the old dowager of chelsey who vowed in her jargon of french and english that he had the air noble that his pallor embellished him that he was an amadis and deserved a gloriana and oh <\s>
<s> what was his joy at hearing that his mistress was come into waiting and was now with her majesty at kensington <\s>
<s> esmond had told jack lockwood to get horses and they would ride for winchester that night when he heard this news he countermanded the horses at once his business lay no longer in hants all his hope and desire lay within a couple of miles of him in kensington park wall <\s>
<s> poor harry had never looked in the glass before so eagerly to see whether he had the bel air and his paleness really did become him he never took such pains about the curl of his periwig and the taste of his embroidery and point lace as now before mr <\s>
<s> amadis presented himself to madam gloriana <\s>
<s> was the fire of the french lines half so murderous as the killing glances from her ladyship's eyes <\s>
<s> darts and raptures how beautiful were they <\s>
<s> and as before the blazing sun of morning the moon fades away in the sky almost invisible esmond thought with a blush perhaps of another sweet pale face sad and faint and fading out of sight with its sweet fond gaze of affection such a last look it seemed to cast as eurydice might have given yearning after her lover when fate and pluto summoned her and she passed away into the shades <\s>
<s> an old story about a fool and a woman <\s>
<s> any taste for pleasure which esmond had and he liked to desipere in loco neither more nor less than most young men of his age he could now gratify to the utmost extent and in the best company which the town afforded <\s>
<s> when the army went into winter quarters abroad those of the officers who had interest or money easily got leave of absence and found it much pleasanter to spend their time in pall mall and hyde park than to pass the winter away behind the fortifications of the dreary old flanders towns where the english troops were gathered <\s>
<s> yachts and packets passed daily between the dutch and flemish ports and harwich the roads thence to london and the great inns were crowded with army gentlemen the taverns and ordinaries of the town swarmed with red coats and our great duke's levees at st <\s>
<s> james's were as thronged as they had been at ghent and brussels where we treated him and he us with the grandeur and ceremony of a sovereign <\s>
<s> though esmond had been appointed to a lieutenancy in the fusileer regiment of which that celebrated officer brigadier john richmond webb was colonel he had never joined the regiment nor been introduced to its excellent commander though they had made the same campaign together and been engaged in the same battle <\s>
<s> but being aide de camp to general lumley who commanded the division of horse and the army marching to its point of destination on the danube by different routes esmond had not fallen in as yet with his commander and future comrades of the fort and it was in london in golden square where major general webb lodged that captain esmond had the honor of first paying his respects to his friend patron and commander of after days <\s>
<s> those who remember this brilliant and accomplished gentleman may recollect his character upon which he prided himself i think not a little of being the handsomest man in the army a poet who writ a dull copy of verses upon the battle of oudenarde three years after describing webb says to noble danger webb conducts the way his great example all his troops obey before the front the general sternly rides with such an air as mars to battle strides propitious heaven must sure a hero save like paris handsome and like hector brave <\s>
<s> webb thought these verses quite as fine as mr <\s>
<s> addison's on the blenheim campaign and indeed to be hector a la mode de paris was part of this gallant gentleman's ambition <\s>
<s> it would have been difficult to find an officer in the whole army or amongst the splendid courtiers and cavaliers of the maison du roy that fought under vendosme and villeroy in the army opposed to ours who was a more accomplished soldier and perfect gentleman and either braver or better looking <\s>

<s> this passage in the memoirs of esmond is written on a leaf inserted into the ms <\s>
<s> book and dated 1744 probably after he had heard of the duchess's death <\s>
<s> on presenting himself at the commander in chief's levee his grace had not the least remembrance of general lumley's aide de camp and though he knew esmond's family perfectly well having served with both lords my lord francis and the viscount esmond's father in flanders and in the duke of york's guard the duke of marlborough who was friendly and serviceable to the so styled legitimate representatives of the viscount castlewood took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant who bore their name <\s>
<s> a word of kindness or acknowledgment or a single glance of approbation might have changed esmond's opinion of the great man and instead of a satire which his pen cannot help writing who knows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of panegyric <\s>
<s> we have but to change the point of view and the greatest action looks mean as we turn the perspective glass and a giant appears a pigmy <\s>
<s> you may describe but who can tell whether your sight is clear or not or your means of information accurate <\s>
<s> had the great man said but a word of kindness to the small one as he would have stepped out of his gilt chariot to shake hands with lazarus in rags and sores if he thought lazarus could have been of any service to him no doubt esmond would have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might but my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment and so muscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition <\s>
<s> so it was however that a young gentleman who in the eyes of his family and in his own doubtless was looked upon as a consummate hero found that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than of the smallest drummer in his grace's army <\s>
<s> the dowager at chelsey was furious against this neglect of her family and had a great battle with lady marlborough as lady castlewood insisted on calling the duchess <\s>
<s> her grace was now mistress of the robes to her majesty and one of the greatest personages in this kingdom as her husband was in all europe and the battle between the two ladies took place in the queen's drawing room <\s>
<s> the duchess in reply to my aunt's eager clamor said haughtily that she had done her best for the legitimate branch of the esmonds and could not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family <\s>
<s> says the viscountess in a fury <\s>
<s> there are bastards among the churchills as your grace knows and the duke of berwick is provided for well enough <\s>
<s> madam says the duchess you know whose fault it is that there are no such dukes in the esmond family too and how that little scheme of a certain lady miscarried <\s>
<s> esmond's friend dick steele who was in waiting on the prince heard the controversy between the ladies at court <\s>
<s> and faith says dick i think harry thy kinswoman had the worst of it <\s>
<s> he could not keep the story quiet twas all over the coffee houses ere night it was printed in a news letter before a month was over and the reply of her grace the duchess of m rlb r gh to a popish lady of the court once a favorite of the late k j m s was printed in half a dozen places with a note stating that this duchess when the head of this lady's family came by his death lately in a fatal duel never rested until she got a pension for the orphan heir and widow from her majesty's bounty <\s>
<s> the squabble did not advance poor esmond's promotion much and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show his face at the commander in chief's levees again <\s>
<s> during those eighteen months which had passed since esmond saw his dear mistress her good father the old dean quitted this life firm in his principles to the very last and enjoining his family always to remember that the queen's brother king james the third was their rightful sovereign <\s>
<s> he made a very edifying end as his daughter told esmond and not a little to her surprise after his death for he had lived always very poorly my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than 3,000 l <\s>
<s> behind him which he bequeathed to her <\s>
<s> with this little fortune lady castlewood was enabled when her daughter's turn at court came to come to london where she took a small genteel house at kensington in the neighborhood of the court bringing her children with her and here it was that esmond found his friends <\s>
<s> as for the young lord his university career had ended rather abruptly <\s>
<s> honest tusher his governor had found my young gentleman quite ungovernable <\s>
<s> why does the stately muse of history that delights in describing the valor of heroes and the grandeur of conquest leave out these scenes so brutal mean and degrading that yet form by far the greater part of the drama of war <\s>
<s> you gentlemen of england who live at home at ease and compliment yourselves in the songs of triumph with which our chieftains are bepraised you pretty maidens that come tumbling down the stairs when the fife and drum call you and huzzah for the british grenadiers do you take account that these items go to make up the amount of the triumph you admire and form part of the duties of the heroes you fondle <\s>
<s> our chief whom england and all europe saving only the frenchmen worshipped almost had this of the godlike in him that he was impassible before victory before danger before defeat <\s>
<s> before the greatest obstacle or the most trivial ceremony before a hundred thousand men drawn in battalia or a peasant slaughtered at the door of his burning hovel before a carouse of drunken german lords or a monarch's court or a cottage table where his plans were laid or an enemy's battery vomiting flame and death and strewing corpses round about him he was always cold calm resolute like fate <\s>
<s> he performed a treason or a court bow he told a falsehood as black as styx as easily as he paid a compliment or spoke about the weather <\s>
<s> he took a mistress and left her he betrayed his benefactor and supported him or would have murdered him with the same calmness always and having no more remorse than clotho when she weaves the thread or lachesis when she cuts it <\s>
<s> in the hour of battle i have heard the prince of savoy's officers say the prince became possessed with a sort of warlike fury his eyes lighted up he rushed hither and thither raging he shrieked curses and encouragement yelling and harking his bloody war dogs on and himself always at the first of the hunt <\s>
<s> our duke was as calm at the mouth of the cannon as at the door of a drawing room <\s>
<s> perhaps he could not have been the great man he was had he had a heart either for love or hatred or pity or fear or regret or remorse <\s>
<s> he achieved the highest deed of daring or deepest calculation of thought as he performed the very meanest action of which a man is capable told a lie or cheated a fond woman or robbed a poor beggar of a halfpenny with a like awful serenity and equal capacity of the highest and lowest acts of our nature <\s>
<s> his qualities were pretty well known in the army where there were parties of all politics and of plenty of shrewdness and wit but there existed such a perfect confidence in him as the first captain of the world and such a faith and admiration in his prodigious genius and fortune that the very men whom he notoriously cheated of their pay the chiefs whom he used and injured for he used all men great and small that came near him as his instruments alike and took something of theirs either some quality or some property the blood of a soldier it might be or a jewelled hat or a hundred thousand crowns from a king or a portion out of a starving sentinel's three farthings or when he was young a kiss from a woman and the gold chain off her neck taking all he could from woman or man and having as i have said this of the godlike in him that he could see a hero perish or a sparrow fall with the same amount of sympathy for either <\s>
<s> not that he had no tears he could always order up this reserve at the proper moment to battle he could draw upon tears or smiles alike and whenever need was for using this cheap coin <\s>
<s> he would cringe to a shoeblack as he would flatter a minister or a monarch be haughty be humble threaten repent weep grasp your hand or stab you whenever he saw occasion but yet those of the army who knew him best and had suffered most from him admired him most of all and as he rode along the lines to battle or galloped up in the nick of time to a battalion reeling from before the enemy's charge or shot the fainting men and officers got new courage as they saw the splendid calm of his face and felt that his will made them irresistible <\s>
<s> after the great victory of blenheim the enthusiasm of the army for the duke even of his bitterest personal enemies in it amounted to a sort of rage nay the very officers who cursed him in their hearts were among the most frantic to cheer him <\s>
<s> who could refuse his meed of admiration to such a victory and such a victor <\s>
<s> not he who writes a man may profess to be ever so much a philosopher but he who fought on that day must feel a thrill of pride as he recalls it <\s>
<s> the french right was posted near to the village of blenheim on the danube where the marshal tallard's quarters were their line extending through it may be a league and a half before lutzingen and up to a woody hill round the base of which and acting against the prince of savoy were forty of his squadrons <\s>
<s> here was a village that the frenchmen had burned the wood being in fact a better shelter and easier of guard than any village <\s>
<s> before these two villages and the french lines ran a little stream not more than two foot broad through a marsh that was mostly dried up from the heats of the weather and this stream was the only separation between the two armies ours coming up and ranging themselves in line of battle before the french at six o'clock in the morning so that our line was quite visible to theirs and the whole of this great plain was black and swarming with troops for hours before the cannonading began <\s>
<s> on one side and the other this cannonading lasted many hours <\s>
<s> the french guns being in position in front of their line and doing severe damage among our horse especially and on our right wing of imperialists under the prince of savoy who could neither advance his artillery nor his lines the ground before him being cut up by ditches morasses and very difficult of passage for the guns <\s>

<s> on presenting himself at the commander in chief's levee his grace had not the least remembrance of general lumley's aide de camp and though he knew esmond's family perfectly well having served with both lords my lord francis and the viscount esmond's father in flanders and in the duke of york's guard the duke of marlborough who was friendly and serviceable to the so styled legitimate representatives of the viscount castlewood took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant who bore their name <\s>
<s> a word of kindness or acknowledgment or a single glance of approbation might have changed esmond's opinion of the great man and instead of a satire which his pen cannot help writing who knows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of panegyric <\s>
<s> we have but to change the point of view and the greatest action looks mean as we turn the perspective glass and a giant appears a pigmy <\s>
<s> you may describe but who can tell whether your sight is clear or not or your means of information accurate <\s>
<s> had the great man said but a word of kindness to the small one as he would have stepped out of his gilt chariot to shake hands with lazarus in rags and sores if he thought lazarus could have been of any service to him no doubt esmond would have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might but my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment and so muscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition <\s>
<s> so it was however that a young gentleman who in the eyes of his family and in his own doubtless was looked upon as a consummate hero found that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than of the smallest drummer in his grace's army <\s>
<s> the dowager at chelsey was furious against this neglect of her family and had a great battle with lady marlborough as lady castlewood insisted on calling the duchess <\s>
<s> her grace was now mistress of the robes to her majesty and one of the greatest personages in this kingdom as her husband was in all europe and the battle between the two ladies took place in the queen's drawing room <\s>
<s> the duchess in reply to my aunt's eager clamor said haughtily that she had done her best for the legitimate branch of the esmonds and could not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family <\s>
<s> says the viscountess in a fury <\s>
<s> there are bastards among the churchills as your grace knows and the duke of berwick is provided for well enough <\s>
<s> madam says the duchess you know whose fault it is that there are no such dukes in the esmond family too and how that little scheme of a certain lady miscarried <\s>
<s> esmond's friend dick steele who was in waiting on the prince heard the controversy between the ladies at court <\s>
<s> and faith says dick i think harry thy kinswoman had the worst of it <\s>
<s> he could not keep the story quiet twas all over the coffee houses ere night it was printed in a news letter before a month was over and the reply of her grace the duchess of m rlb r gh to a popish lady of the court once a favorite of the late k j m s was printed in half a dozen places with a note stating that this duchess when the head of this lady's family came by his death lately in a fatal duel never rested until she got a pension for the orphan heir and widow from her majesty's bounty <\s>
<s> the squabble did not advance poor esmond's promotion much and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show his face at the commander in chief's levees again <\s>
<s> during those eighteen months which had passed since esmond saw his dear mistress her good father the old dean quitted this life firm in his principles to the very last and enjoining his family always to remember that the queen's brother king james the third was their rightful sovereign <\s>
<s> he made a very edifying end as his daughter told esmond and not a little to her surprise after his death for he had lived always very poorly my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than 3,000 l <\s>
<s> behind him which he bequeathed to her <\s>
<s> with this little fortune lady castlewood was enabled when her daughter's turn at court came to come to london where she took a small genteel house at kensington in the neighborhood of the court bringing her children with her and here it was that esmond found his friends <\s>
<s> as for the young lord his university career had ended rather abruptly <\s>
<s> honest tusher his governor had found my young gentleman quite ungovernable <\s>
