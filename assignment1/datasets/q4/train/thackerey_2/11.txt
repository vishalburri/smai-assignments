<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>

<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>

<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>

<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>

<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>

<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>

<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>

<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>

<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>

<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>

<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>

<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>

<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>

<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>

<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>

<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>

<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>

<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>

<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>

<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>

<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>

<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
<s> there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship's rank and the estate out of debt <\s>
<s> and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children <\s>
<s> there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son <\s>
<s> esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty the youths who quitted mother's apron strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes <\s>
<s> but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humor and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child <\s>
<s> not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there <\s>
<s> the children were nothing loth for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough <\s>
<s> but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord <\s>
<s> his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other's will was law nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle <\s>
<s> every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded <\s>
<s> it was harry esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her <\s>
<s> and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood's face it was amusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humor of the elder who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there <\s>
<s> she lauded the children and wished as indeed she well might that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs <\s>
<s> she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix's though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother lady castlewood's was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way <\s>
<s> my lord mohun comes among us for no good <\s>
<s> there had ridden along with this old princess's cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood <\s>
<s> my lord firebrace was but a feeble minded and weak limbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts <\s>
<s> he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk <\s>
<s> and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable <\s>
<s> on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within <\s>
<s> they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver's time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge <\s>
<s> after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day <\s>
<s> all night long over his tobacco pipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more <\s>
<s> at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun's looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him <\s>
<s> indeed lady castlewood said i liked his conversation well enough <\s>
<s> tis more amusing than that of most people i know <\s>
<s> i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied <\s>
<s> your ladyship does not know the world said her husband and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen <\s>
<s> you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen <\s>
<s> begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see said my lord slapping the table <\s>
<s> indeed francis i never thought otherwise answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them <\s>
<s> mohun is the best fellow in england and i'll invite him here just to plague that woman <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry <\s>
<s> that's the way she treats me he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on <\s>
<s> i'm nobody in my own house <\s>
<s> i'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter <\s>
<s> i'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does <\s>
<s> she puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs and i'll swear tells frank and beaty that papa's a reprobate and that they ought to despise me <\s>
<s> indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you harry esmond interposed <\s>
<s> from her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter <\s>
<s> she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early <\s>
<s> the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both <\s>
<s> he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right <\s>
<s> he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles <\s>
<s> he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heir apparent taking after the example of my lord his father <\s>
<s> if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way indeed twas on the day after new year's day and an excess of mince pie and said with some of his usual oaths d n it harry esmond you see how my lady takes on about frank's megrim <\s>
<s> she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once <\s>
<s> she don't care about my head now <\s>
<s> they're like that women are all the same harry all jilts in their hearts <\s>
<s> stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that's handsomer than an old cinder faced bed maker <\s>
<s> it was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply <\s>
<s> the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them <\s>
<s> alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy <\s>
<s> to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all <\s>
<s> harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood's own making and harry divined my lady's his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile <\s>
<s> tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear <\s>
<s> but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so <\s>
<s> the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain <\s>
<s> so into the sad secret of his patron's household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve <\s>
<s> it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william's government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty <\s>
<s> he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband's opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simple hearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him <\s>
<s> so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his self denial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humor <\s>
<s> the year after the revolution and all through king william's life tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets <\s>
<s> but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference <\s>
<s> harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in after life as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises <\s>
<s> the father's companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him <\s>
<s> it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady's father dean armstrong mr <\s>
<s> collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows foot <\s>
<s> tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more <\s>
<s> now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy <\s>
<s> after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men <\s>
<s> my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his father in law from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary <\s>
<s> indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him <\s>
<s> my lord laughed at his wife's objections the standard of virtue did not fit him much <\s>
<s> the last conference which mr <\s>
<s> holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a half hour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet <\s>
<s> after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife's questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering poor children poor children <\s>
<s> in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm <\s>
<s> for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation <\s>
<s> my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him for my lord's infatuation about mrs <\s>
<s> marwood was known only too well <\s>
<s> young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet <\s>
<s> one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favor was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond's life <\s>
<s> a very few months after my lord's coming to castlewood in the winter time the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child's who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident <\s>
<s> but certainly twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face <\s>
<s> ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy good for nothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver and harry became quite as one of the family <\s>
<s> his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life <\s>
<s> and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than from the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member <\s>
<s> tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion even in these young days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't <\s>
<s> my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one <\s>
<s> at the end then of this year 96 it might have been a fortnight after mr <\s>
<s> holt's last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast <\s>
<s> what is it rachel <\s>
<s> says he holding out his empty glass to be filled <\s>
<s> tis the 29th of december says my lady with her fond look of gratitude and my toast is harry and god bless him who saved my boy's life my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room <\s>
<s> what was the matter <\s>
<s> we all knew that some great grief was over him <\s>
<s> whether my lord's prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming to the title <\s>
