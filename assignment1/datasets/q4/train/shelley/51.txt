<s> here he wrote the fragments of marenghi and the woodman and the nightingale which he afterwards threw aside <\s>
<s> at this time shelley suffered greatly in health <\s>
<s> he put himself under the care of a medical man who promised great things and made him endure severe bodily pain without any good results <\s>
<s> constant and poignant physical suffering exhausted him and though he preserved the appearance of cheerfulness and often greatly enjoyed our wanderings in the environs of naples and our excursions on its sunny sea yet many hours were passed when his thoughts shadowed by illness became gloomy and then he escaped to solitude and in verses which he hid from fear of wounding me poured forth morbid but too natural bursts of discontent and sadness <\s>
<s> one looks back with unspeakable regret and gnawing remorse to such periods fancying that had one been more alive to the nature of his feelings and more attentive to soothe them such would not have existed <\s>
<s> and yet enjoying as he appeared to do every sight or influence of earth or sky it was difficult to imagine that any melancholy he showed was aught but the effect of the constant pain to which he was a martyr <\s>
<s> we lived in utter solitude <\s>
<s> and such is often not the nurse of cheerfulness for then at least with those who have been exposed to adversity the mind broods over its sorrows too intently while the society of the enlightened the witty and the wise enables us to forget ourselves by making us the sharers of the thoughts of others which is a portion of the philosophy of happiness <\s>
<s> shelley never liked society in numbers it harassed and wearied him but neither did he like loneliness and usually when alone sheltered himself against memory and reflection in a book <\s>
<s> but with one or two whom he loved he gave way to wild and joyous spirits or in more serious conversation expounded his opinions with vivacity and eloquence <\s>
<s> if an argument arose no man ever argued better <\s>
<s> he was clear logical and earnest in supporting his own views attentive patient and impartial while listening to those on the adverse side <\s>
<s> had not a wall of prejudice been raised at this time between him and his countrymen how many would have sought the acquaintance of one whom to know was to love and to revere <\s>
<s> how many of the more enlightened of his contemporaries have since regretted that they did not seek him <\s>
<s> how very few knew his worth while he lived <\s>
<s> and of those few several were withheld by timidity or envy from declaring their sense of it <\s>
<s> but no man was ever more enthusiastically loved more looked up to as one superior to his fellows in intellectual endowments and moral worth by the few who knew him well and had sufficient nobleness of soul to appreciate his superiority <\s>
<s> his excellence is now acknowledged but even while admitted not duly appreciated <\s>
<s> for who except those who were acquainted with him can imagine his unwearied benevolence his generosity his systematic forbearance <\s>
<s> and still less is his vast superiority in intellectual attainments sufficiently understood his sagacity his clear understanding his learning his prodigious memory <\s>
<s> all these as displayed in conversation were known to few while he lived and are now silent in the tomb ahi orbo mondo ingrato <\s>
