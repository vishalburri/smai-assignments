<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>

<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>

<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>

<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>

<s> note on the witch of atlas by mrs <\s>
<s> we spent the summer of 1820 at the baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa <\s>
<s> these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability <\s>
<s> we made several excursions in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains <\s>
<s> the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright <\s>
<s> during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages <\s>
<s> the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return <\s>
<s> during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested <\s>
<s> the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas <\s>
<s> it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours <\s>
<s> the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him <\s>
<s> even now i believe that i was in the right <\s>
<s> shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing <\s>
<s> he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated <\s>
<s> i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse <\s>
<s> that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right <\s>
<s> the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas <\s>
<s> this is not what i thought life was <\s>
<s> i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen <\s>
<s> in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of others ... and when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass <\s>
<s> i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched <\s>
<s> but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination <\s>
<s> shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet <\s>
<s> such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes <\s>
<s> these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved <\s>
<s> oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant <\s>
<s> a tragedy in two acts translated from the original doric <\s>
<s> choose reform or civil war when through thy streets instead of hare with dogs a consort queen shall hunt a king with hogs riding on the ionian minotaur <\s>
<s> begun at the baths of san giuliano near pisa august 24 1819 published anonymously by j <\s>
<s> johnston cheapside imprint c f <\s>
<s> on a threat of prosecution the publisher surrendered the whole impression seven copies the total number sold excepted <\s>
<s> oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works 1839 but it was included by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley in the second edition of that year <\s>
<s> our text is that of the editio princeps 1820 save in three places where the reading of edition 1820 will be found in the notes advertisement <\s>
<s> this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty <\s>
<s> it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs <\s>
<s> the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind <\s>
<s> no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act <\s>
<s> the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated <\s>
<s> should the remaining portions of this tragedy be found entitled swellfoot in angaria and charite the translator might be tempted to give them to the reading public <\s>
