<s> come be happy sit near me shadow vested misery coy unwilling silent bride mourning in thy robe of pride desolation deified <\s>
<s> come be happy sit near me sad as i may seem to thee i am happier far than thou lady whose imperial brow is endiademed with woe <\s>
<s> we have known each other like a sister and a brother living in the same lone home many years we must live some hours or ages yet to come <\s>
<s> tis an evil lot and yet let us make the best of it if love can live when pleasure dies we two will love till in our eyes this heart's hell seem paradise <\s>
<s> come be happy lie thee down on the fresh grass newly mown where the grasshopper doth sing merrily one joyous thing in a world of sorrowing <\s>
<s> there our tent shall be the willow and mine arm shall be thy pillow sounds and odours sorrowful because they once were sweet shall lull us to slumber deep and dull <\s>
<s> thy frozen pulses flutter with a love thou darest not utter <\s>
<s> thou art murmuring thou art weeping is thine icy bosom leaping while my burning heart lies sleeping <\s>
<s> thy lips are cold round my neck thine arms enfold they are soft but chill and dead and thy tears upon my head burn like points of frozen lead <\s>
<s> hasten to the bridal bed underneath the grave tis spread in darkness may our love be hid oblivion be our coverlid we may rest and none forbid <\s>
<s> clasp me till our hearts be grown like two shadows into one till this dreadful transport may like a vapour fade away in the sleep that lasts alway <\s>
<s> we may dream in that long sleep that we are not those who weep e'en as pleasure dreams of thee life deserting misery thou mayst dream of her with me <\s>

<s> the sun is warm the sky is clear the waves are dancing fast and bright blue isles and snowy mountains wear the purple noon's transparent might the breath of the moist earth is light 5 around its unexpanded buds like many a voice of one delight the winds the birds the ocean floods the city's voice itself is soft like solitude's <\s>
<s> i see the deep's untrampled floor 10 with green and purple seaweeds strown i see the waves upon the shore like light dissolved in star showers thrown i sit upon the sands alone the lightning of the noontide ocean 15 is flashing round me and a tone arises from its measured motion how sweet <\s>
<s> did any heart now share in my emotion <\s>
<s> i have nor hope nor health nor peace within nor calm around 20 nor that content surpassing wealth the sage in meditation found and walked with inward glory crowned nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure <\s>
<s> others i see whom these surround 25 smiling they live and call life pleasure to me that cup has been dealt in another measure <\s>
<s> yet now despair itself is mild even as the winds and waters are i could lie down like a tired child 30 and weep away the life of care which i have borne and yet must bear till death like sleep might steal on me and i might feel in the warm air my cheek grow cold and hear the sea 35 breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony <\s>
<s> some might lament that i were cold as i when this sweet day is gone which my lost heart too soon grown old insults with this untimely moan 40 they might lament for i am one whom men love not and yet regret unlike this day which when the sun shall on its stainless glory set will linger though enjoyed like joy in memory yet <\s>

<s> garnett relics of shelley 1862 a woodman whose rough heart was out of tune i think such hearts yet never came to good hated to hear under the stars or moon one nightingale in an interfluous wood satiate the hungry dark with melody 5 and as a vale is watered by a flood or as the moonlight fills the open sky struggling with darkness as a tuberose peoples some indian dell with scents which lie like clouds above the flower from which they rose 10 the singing of that happy nightingale in this sweet forest from the golden close of evening till the star of dawn may fail was interfused upon the silentness the folded roses and the violets pale 15 heard her within their slumbers the abyss of heaven with all its planets the dull ear of the night cradled earth the loneliness of the circumfluous waters every sphere and every flower and beam and cloud and wave 20 and every wind of the mute atmosphere and every beast stretched in its rugged cave and every bird lulled on its mossy bough and every silver moth fresh from the grave which is its cradle ever from below 25 aspiring like one who loves too fair too far to be consumed within the purest glow of one serene and unapproached star as if it were a lamp of earthly light unconscious as some human lovers are 30 itself how low how high beyond all height the heaven where it would perish and every form that worshipped in the temple of the night was awed into delight and by the charm girt as with an interminable zone 35 whilst that sweet bird whose music was a storm of sound shook forth the dull oblivion out of their dreams harmony became love in every soul but one <\s>
<s> and so this man returned with axe and saw 40 at evening close from killing the tall treen the soul of whom by nature's gentle law was each a wood nymph and kept ever green the pavement and the roof of the wild copse chequering the sunlight of the blue serene 45 with jagged leaves and from the forest tops singing the winds to sleep or weeping oft fast showers of aereal water drops into their mother's bosom sweet and soft nature's pure tears which have no bitterness 50 around the cradles of the birds aloft they spread themselves into the loveliness of fan like leaves and over pallid flowers hang like moist clouds or where high branches kiss make a green space among the silent bowers 55 like a vast fane in a metropolis surrounded by the columns and the towers all overwrought with branch like traceries in which there is religion and the mute persuasion of unkindled melodies 60 odours and gleams and murmurs which the lute of the blind pilot spirit of the blast stirs as it sails now grave and now acute wakening the leaves and waves ere it has passed to such brief unison as on the brain 65 one tone which never can recur has cast one accent never to return again <\s>
<s> the world is full of woodmen who expel love's gentle dryads from the haunts of life and vex the nightingales in every dell <\s>
