<s> thither still the myriads came seeking to quench the agony of the flame which raged like poison through their bursting veins naked they were from torture without shame spotted with nameless scars and lurid blains 3980 childhood and youth and age writhing in savage pains <\s>
<s> it was not thirst but madness <\s>
<s> many saw their own lean image everywhere it went a ghastlier self beside them till the awe of that dread sight to self destruction sent 3985 those shrieking victims some ere life was spent sought with a horrid sympathy to shed contagion on the sound and others rent their matted hair and cried aloud we tread on fire <\s>
<s> the avenging power his hell on earth has spread <\s>
<s> sometimes the living by the dead were hid <\s>
<s> near the great fountain in the public square where corpses made a crumbling pyramid under the sun was heard one stifled prayer for life in the hot silence of the air 3995 and strange twas amid that hideous heap to see some shrouded in their long and golden hair as if not dead but slumbering quietly like forms which sculptors carve then love to agony <\s>
<s> famine had spared the palace of the king 4000 he rioted in festival the while he and his guards and priests but plague did fling one shadow upon all <\s>
<s> famine can smile on him who brings it food and pass with guile of thankful falsehood like a courtier gray 4005 the house dog of the throne but many a mile comes plague a winged wolf who loathes alway the garbage and the scum that strangers make her prey <\s>
<s> so near the throne amid the gorgeous feast sheathed in resplendent arms or loosely dight 4010 to luxury ere the mockery yet had ceased that lingered on his lips the warrior's might was loosened and a new and ghastlier night in dreams of frenzy lapped his eyes he fell headlong or with stiff eyeballs sate upright 4015 among the guests or raving mad did tell strange truths a dying seer of dark oppression's hell <\s>
<s> the princes and the priests were pale with terror that monstrous faith wherewith they ruled mankind fell like a shaft loosed by the bowman's error 4020 on their own hearts they sought and they could find no refuge 'twas the blind who led the blind <\s>
<s> so through the desolate streets to the high fane the many tongued and endless armies wind in sad procession each among the train 4025 to his own idol lifts his supplications vain <\s>
<s> they cried we know our secret pride has scorned thee and thy worship and thy name secure in human power we have defied thy fearful might we bend in fear and shame 4030 before thy presence with the dust we claim kindred be merciful o king of heaven <\s>
<s> most justly have we suffered for thy fame made dim but be at length our sins forgiven ere to despair and death thy worshippers be driven <\s>
<s> o king of glory <\s>
<s> thou alone hast power <\s>
<s> who can resist thy will <\s>
<s> who can restrain thy wrath when on the guilty thou dost shower the shafts of thy revenge a blistering rain <\s>
<s> greatest and best be merciful again <\s>
<s> 4040 have we not stabbed thine enemies and made the earth an altar and the heavens a fane where thou wert worshipped with their blood and laid those hearts in dust which would thy searchless works have weighed <\s>
<s> well didst thou loosen on this impious city 4045 thine angels of revenge recall them now thy worshippers abased here kneel for pity and bind their souls by an immortal vow we swear by thee <\s>
<s> and to our oath do thou give sanction from thine hell of fiends and flame 4050 that we will kill with fire and torments slow the last of those who mocked thy holy name and scorned the sacred laws thy prophets did proclaim <\s>
<s> thus they with trembling limbs and pallid lips worshipped their own hearts image dim and vast 4055 scared by the shade wherewith they would eclipse the light of other minds troubled they passed from the great temple fiercely still and fast the arrows of the plague among them fell and they on one another gazed aghast 4060 and through the hosts contention wild befell as each of his own god the wondrous works did tell <\s>
<s> and oromaze joshua and mahomet moses and buddh zerdusht and brahm and foh a tumult of strange names which never met 4065 before as watchwords of a single woe arose each raging votary gan to throw aloft his armed hands and each did howl our god alone is god and slaughter now would have gone forth when from beneath a cowl 4070 a voice came forth which pierced like ice through every soul <\s>
<s> twas an iberian priest from whom it came a zealous man who led the legioned west with words which faith and pride had steeped in flame to quell the unbelievers a dire guest 4075 even to his friends was he for in his breast did hate and guile lie watchful intertwined twin serpents in one deep and winding nest he loathed all faith beside his own and pined to wreak his fear of heaven in vengeance on mankind <\s>
<s> but more he loathed and hated the clear light of wisdom and free thought and more did fear lest kindled once its beams might pierce the night even where his idol stood for far and near did many a heart in europe leap to hear 4085 that faith and tyranny were trampled down many a pale victim doomed for truth to share the murderer's cell or see with helpless groan the priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own <\s>
<s> he dared not kill the infidels with fire 4090 or steel in europe the slow agonies of legal torture mocked his keen desire so he made truce with those who did despise the expiation and the sacrifice that though detested islam's kindred creed 4095 might crush for him those deadlier enemies for fear of god did in his bosom breed a jealous hate of man an unreposing need <\s>
<s> he cried when we are dead the day of judgement comes and all shall surely know 4100 whose god is god each fearfully shall pay the errors of his faith in endless woe <\s>
<s> but there is sent a mortal vengeance now on earth because an impious race had spurned him whom we all adore a subtle foe 4105 by whom for ye this dread reward was earned and kingly thrones which rest on faith nigh overturned <\s>
<s> think ye because ye weep and kneel and pray that god will lull the pestilence <\s>
<s> it rose even from beneath his throne where many a day 4110 his mercy soothed it to a dark repose it walks upon the earth to judge his foes and what are thou and i that he should deign to curb his ghastly minister or close the gates of death ere they receive the twain 4115 who shook with mortal spells his undefended reign <\s>
<s> ay there is famine in the gulf of hell its giant worms of fire for ever yawn their lurid eyes are on us <\s>
<s> those who fell by the swift shafts of pestilence ere dawn 4120 are in their jaws <\s>
<s> they hunger for the spawn of satan their own brethren who were sent to make our souls their spoil <\s>
<s> they fawn like dogs and they will sleep with luxury spent when those detested hearts their iron fangs have rent <\s>
<s> our god may then lull pestilence to sleep pile high the pyre of expiation now a forest's spoil of boughs and on the heap pour venomous gums which sullenly and slow when touched by flame shall burn and melt and flow 4130 a stream of clinging fire and fix on high a net of iron and spread forth below a couch of snakes and scorpions and the fry of centipedes and worms earth's hellish progeny <\s>
<s> let laon and laone on that pyre 4135 linked tight with burning brass perish then pray that with this sacrifice the withering ire of heaven may be appeased <\s>
<s> he ceased and they a space stood silent as far far away the echoes of his voice among them died 4140 and he knelt down upon the dust alway muttering the curses of his speechless pride whilst shame and fear and awe the armies did divide <\s>
<s> his voice was like a blast that burst the portal of fabled hell and as he spake each one 4145 saw gape beneath the chasms of fire immortal and heaven above seemed cloven where on a throne girt round with storms and shadows sate alone their king and judge fear killed in every breast all natural pity then a fear unknown 4150 before and with an inward fire possessed they raged like homeless beasts whom burning woods invest <\s>
<s> twas morn at noon the public crier went forth proclaiming through the living and the dead the monarch saith that his great empire's worth 4155 is set on laon and laone's head he who but one yet living here can lead or who the life from both their hearts can wring shall be the kingdom's heir a glorious meed <\s>
<s> but he who both alive can hither bring 4160 the princess shall espouse and reign an equal king <\s>
<s> ere night the pyre was piled the net of iron was spread above the fearful couch below it overtopped the towers that did environ that spacious square for fear is never slow 4165 to build the thrones of hate her mate and foe so she scourged forth the maniac multitude to rear this pyramid tottering and slow plague stricken foodless like lean herds pursued by gadflies they have piled the heath and gums and wood <\s>
<s> night came a starless and a moonless gloom <\s>
<s> until the dawn those hosts of many a nation stood round that pile as near one lover's tomb two gentle sisters mourn their desolation and in the silence of that expectation 4175 was heard on high the reptiles hiss and crawl it was so deep save when the devastation of the swift pest with fearful interval marking its path with shrieks among the crowd would fall <\s>
<s> morn came among those sleepless multitudes 4180 madness and fear and plague and famine still heaped corpse on corpse as in autumnal woods the frosts of many a wind with dead leaves fill earth's cold and sullen brooks in silence still the pale survivors stood ere noon the fear 4185 of hell became a panic which did kill like hunger or disease with whispers drear as hush <\s>
<s> come they yet just heaven <\s>
<s> thine hour is near <\s>
<s> and priests rushed through their ranks some counterfeiting the rage they did inspire some mad indeed 4190 with their own lies they said their god was waiting to see his enemies writhe and burn and bleed and that till then the snakes of hell had need of human souls three hundred furnaces soon blazed through the wide city where with speed 4195 men brought their infidel kindred to appease god's wrath and while they burned knelt round on quivering knees <\s>
<s> the noontide sun was darkened with that smoke the winds of eve dispersed those ashes gray <\s>
<s> the madness which these rites had lulled awoke 4200 again at sunset who shall dare to say the deeds which night and fear brought forth or weigh in balance just the good and evil there <\s>
<s> he might man's deep and searchless heart display and cast a light on those dim labyrinths where 4205 hope near imagined chasms is struggling with despair <\s>
<s> tis said a mother dragged three children then to those fierce flames which roast the eyes in the head and laughed and died and that unholy men feasting like fiends upon the infidel dead 4210 looked from their meal and saw an angel tread the visible floor of heaven and it was she <\s>
<s> and on that night one without doubt or dread came to the fire and said stop i am he <\s>
<s> kill me they burned them both with hellish mockery <\s>
<s> and one by one that night young maidens came beauteous and calm like shapes of living stone clothed in the light of dreams and by the flame which shrank as overgorged they laid them down and sung a low sweet song of which alone 4220 one word was heard and that was liberty and that some kissed their marble feet with moan like love and died and then that they did die with happy smiles which sunk in white tranquillity <\s>
