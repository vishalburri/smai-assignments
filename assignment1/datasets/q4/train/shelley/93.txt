<s> as to antistrophe 2b that follows antistrophe 2a so far as it goes but after line 9 it breaks off suddenly and closes with two lines corresponding in length and rhyme to the closing couplet of antistrophe 1b the section immediately preceding which however belongs not to this group but to the other <\s>

<s> as to antistrophe 2b that follows antistrophe 2a so far as it goes but after line 9 it breaks off suddenly and closes with two lines corresponding in length and rhyme to the closing couplet of antistrophe 1b the section immediately preceding which however belongs not to this group but to the other <\s>

<s> as to antistrophe 2b that follows antistrophe 2a so far as it goes but after line 9 it breaks off suddenly and closes with two lines corresponding in length and rhyme to the closing couplet of antistrophe 1b the section immediately preceding which however belongs not to this group but to the other <\s>
