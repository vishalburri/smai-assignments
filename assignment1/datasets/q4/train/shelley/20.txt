<s> it seems to float ever for ever upon that many winding river between mountains woods abysses 80 a paradise of wildernesses <\s>
<s> till like one in slumber bound borne to the ocean i float down around into a sea profound of ever spreading sound meanwhile thy spirit lifts its pinions 85 in music's most serene dominions catching the winds that fan that happy heaven <\s>
<s> and we sail on away afar without a course without a star but by the instinct of sweet music driven 90 till through elysian garden islets by thee most beautiful of pilots where never mortal pinnace glided the boat of my desire is guided realms where the air we breathe is love 95 which in the winds on the waves doth move harmonizing this earth with what we feel above <\s>
<s> we have passed age's icy caves and manhood's dark and tossing waves and youth's smooth ocean smiling to betray 100 beyond the glassy gulfs we flee of shadow peopled infancy through death and birth to a diviner day a paradise of vaulted bowers lit by downward gazing flowers 105 and watery paths that wind between wildernesses calm and green peopled by shapes too bright to see and rest having beheld somewhat like thee which walk upon the sea and chant melodiously <\s>

<s> all else had been subdued to me alone the soul of man like unextinguished fire 5 yet burns towards heaven with fierce reproach and doubt and lamentation and reluctant prayer hurling up insurrection which might make our antique empire insecure though built on eldest faith and hell's coeval fear 10 and though my curses through the pendulous air like snow on herbless peaks fall flake by flake and cling to it though under my wrath's night it climbs the crags of life step after step which wound it as ice wounds unsandalled feet 15 it yet remains supreme o'er misery aspiring unrepressed yet soon to fall even now have i begotten a strange wonder that fatal child the terror of the earth who waits but till the destined hour arrive 20 bearing from demogorgon's vacant throne the dreadful might of ever living limbs which clothed that awful spirit unbeheld to redescend and trample out the spark <\s>
<s> pour forth heaven's wine idaean ganymede 25 and let it fill the daedal cups like fire and from the flower inwoven soil divine ye all triumphant harmonies arise as dew from earth under the twilight stars drink <\s>
<s> be the nectar circling through your veins 30 the soul of joy ye ever living gods till exultation burst in one wide voice like music from elysian winds <\s>
<s> and thou ascend beside me veiled in the light of the desire which makes thee one with me 35 thetis bright image of eternity <\s>
<s> when thou didst cry insufferable might <\s>
<s> i sustain not the quick flames the penetrating presence all my being like him whom the numidian seps did thaw 40 into a dew with poison is dissolved sinking through its foundations even then two mighty spirits mingling made a third mightier than either which unbodied now between us floats felt although unbeheld 45 waiting the incarnation which ascends hear ye the thunder of the fiery wheels griding the winds from demogorgon's throne <\s>
<s> feel'st thou not o world the earthquake of his chariot thundering up 50 olympus <\s>
