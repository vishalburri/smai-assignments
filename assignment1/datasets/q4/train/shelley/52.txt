<s> thou dirge of the dying year to which this closing night will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 25 vaulted with all thy congregated might of vapours from whose solid atmosphere black rain and fire and hail will burst oh hear <\s>
<s> thou who didst waken from his summer dreams the blue mediterranean where he lay 30 lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay and saw in sleep old palaces and towers quivering within the wave's intenser day all overgrown with azure moss and flowers 35 so sweet the sense faints picturing them <\s>
<s> thou for whose path the atlantic's level powers cleave themselves into chasms while far below the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear the sapless foliage of the ocean know 40 thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves oh hear <\s>
<s> if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee a wave to pant beneath thy power and share 45 the impulse of thy strength only less free than thou o uncontrollable <\s>
<s> if even i were as in my boyhood and could be the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven as then when to outstrip thy skiey speed 50 scarce seemed a vision i would ne'er have striven as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need <\s>

<s> they began as i foresaw at sunset with a violent tempest of hail and rain attended by that magnificent thunder and lightning peculiar to the cisalpine regions <\s>

<s> o wild west wind thou breath of autumn's being thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing yellow and black and pale and hectic red pestilence stricken multitudes o thou 5 who chariotest to their dark wintry bed the winged seeds where they lie cold and low each like a corpse within its grave until thine azure sister of the spring shall blow her clarion o'er the dreaming earth and fill 10 driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air with living hues and odours plain and hill wild spirit which art moving everywhere destroyer and preserver hear oh hear <\s>
<s> thou on whose stream mid the steep sky's commotion 15 loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean angels of rain and lightning there are spread on the blue surface of thine aery surge like the bright hair uplifted from the head 20 of some fierce maenad even from the dim verge of the horizon to the zenith's height the locks of the approaching storm <\s>
<s> thou dirge of the dying year to which this closing night will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 25 vaulted with all thy congregated might of vapours from whose solid atmosphere black rain and fire and hail will burst oh hear <\s>
<s> thou who didst waken from his summer dreams the blue mediterranean where he lay 30 lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay and saw in sleep old palaces and towers quivering within the wave's intenser day all overgrown with azure moss and flowers 35 so sweet the sense faints picturing them <\s>
<s> thou for whose path the atlantic's level powers cleave themselves into chasms while far below the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear the sapless foliage of the ocean know 40 thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves oh hear <\s>
<s> if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee a wave to pant beneath thy power and share 45 the impulse of thy strength only less free than thou o uncontrollable <\s>
<s> if even i were as in my boyhood and could be the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven as then when to outstrip thy skiey speed 50 scarce seemed a vision i would ne'er have striven as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need <\s>

<s> thou dirge of the dying year to which this closing night will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 25 vaulted with all thy congregated might of vapours from whose solid atmosphere black rain and fire and hail will burst oh hear <\s>
<s> thou who didst waken from his summer dreams the blue mediterranean where he lay 30 lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay and saw in sleep old palaces and towers quivering within the wave's intenser day all overgrown with azure moss and flowers 35 so sweet the sense faints picturing them <\s>
<s> thou for whose path the atlantic's level powers cleave themselves into chasms while far below the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear the sapless foliage of the ocean know 40 thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves oh hear <\s>
<s> if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee a wave to pant beneath thy power and share 45 the impulse of thy strength only less free than thou o uncontrollable <\s>
<s> if even i were as in my boyhood and could be the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven as then when to outstrip thy skiey speed 50 scarce seemed a vision i would ne'er have striven as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need <\s>

<s> thou on whose stream mid the steep sky's commotion 15 loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean angels of rain and lightning there are spread on the blue surface of thine aery surge like the bright hair uplifted from the head 20 of some fierce maenad even from the dim verge of the horizon to the zenith's height the locks of the approaching storm <\s>
<s> thou dirge of the dying year to which this closing night will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 25 vaulted with all thy congregated might of vapours from whose solid atmosphere black rain and fire and hail will burst oh hear <\s>
<s> thou who didst waken from his summer dreams the blue mediterranean where he lay 30 lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay and saw in sleep old palaces and towers quivering within the wave's intenser day all overgrown with azure moss and flowers 35 so sweet the sense faints picturing them <\s>
<s> thou for whose path the atlantic's level powers cleave themselves into chasms while far below the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear the sapless foliage of the ocean know 40 thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves oh hear <\s>
<s> if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee a wave to pant beneath thy power and share 45 the impulse of thy strength only less free than thou o uncontrollable <\s>
<s> if even i were as in my boyhood and could be the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven as then when to outstrip thy skiey speed 50 scarce seemed a vision i would ne'er have striven as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need <\s>
