<s> is this new feeling but a visioned ghost of slumber <\s>
<s> if indeed i am a soul a free a disembodied soul 165 speak again to me <\s>
<s> fairy i am the fairy mab to me tis given the wonders of the human world to keep the secrets of the immeasurable past in the unfailing consciences of men 170 those stern unflattering chroniclers i find the future from the causes which arise in each event i gather not the sting which retributive memory implants in the hard bosom of the selfish man 175 nor that ecstatic and exulting throb which virtue's votary feels when he sums up the thoughts and actions of a well spent day are unforeseen unregistered by me and it is yet permitted me to rend 180 the veil of mortal frailty that the spirit clothed in its changeless purity may know how soonest to accomplish the great end for which it hath its being and may taste that peace which in the end all life will share <\s>
<s> 185 this is the meed of virtue happy soul ascend the car with me <\s>
<s> the chains of earth's immurement fell from ianthe's spirit they shrank and brake like bandages of straw 190 beneath a wakened giant's strength <\s>
<s> she knew her glorious change and felt in apprehension uncontrolled new raptures opening round each day dream of her mortal life 195 each frenzied vision of the slumbers that closed each well spent day seemed now to meet reality <\s>
<s> the fairy and the soul proceeded the silver clouds disparted 200 and as the car of magic they ascended again the speechless music swelled again the coursers of the air unfurled their azure pennons and the queen shaking the beamy reins 205 bade them pursue their way <\s>
<s> the magic car moved on <\s>
<s> the night was fair and countless stars studded heaven's dark blue vault just o'er the eastern wave 210 peeped the first faint smile of morn the magic car moved on from the celestial hoofs the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew and where the burning wheels 215 eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak was traced a line of lightning <\s>
<s> now it flew far above a rock the utmost verge of earth the rival of the andes whose dark brow 220 lowered o'er the silver sea <\s>
<s> far far below the chariot's path calm as a slumbering babe tremendous ocean lay <\s>
<s> the mirror of its stillness showed 225 the pale and waning stars the chariot's fiery track and the gray light of morn tinging those fleecy clouds that canopied the dawn <\s>
<s> 230 seemed it that the chariot's way lay through the midst of an immense concave radiant with million constellations tinged with shades of infinite colour and semicircled with a belt 235 flashing incessant meteors <\s>
<s> the magic car moved on <\s>
<s> as they approached their goal the coursers seemed to gather speed the sea no longer was distinguished earth 240 appeared a vast and shadowy sphere the sun's unclouded orb rolled through the black concave its rays of rapid light parted around the chariot's swifter course 245 and fell like ocean's feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessel's prow <\s>
<s> the magic car moved on <\s>
<s> earth's distant orb appeared 250 the smallest light that twinkles in the heaven whilst round the chariot's way innumerable systems rolled and countless spheres diffused an ever varying glory <\s>
<s> 255 it was a sight of wonder some were horned like the crescent moon some shed a mild and silver beam like hesperus o'er the western sea some dashed athwart with trains of flame 260 like worlds to death and ruin driven some shone like suns and as the chariot passed eclipsed all other light <\s>
<s> in this interminable wilderness 265 of worlds at whose immensity even soaring fancy staggers here is thy fitting temple <\s>
<s> yet not the lightest leaf that quivers to the passing breeze 270 is less instinct with thee yet not the meanest worm that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead less shares thy eternal breath <\s>
<s> 275 imperishable as this scene here is thy fitting temple <\s>
<s> if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the wild ocean's echoing shore and thou hast lingered there until the sun's broad orb seemed resting on the burnished wave 5 thou must have marked the lines of purple gold that motionless hung o'er the sinking sphere thou must have marked the billowy clouds edged with intolerable radiancy 10 towering like rocks of jet crowned with a diamond wreath <\s>
<s> and yet there is a moment when the sun's highest point peeps like a star o'er ocean's western edge 15 when those far clouds of feathery gold shaded with deepest purple gleam like islands on a dark blue sea then has thy fancy soared above the earth and furled its wearied wing 20 within the fairy's fane <\s>
<s> yet not the golden islands gleaming in yon flood of light nor the feathery curtains stretching o'er the sun's bright couch 25 nor the burnished ocean waves paving that gorgeous dome so fair so wonderful a sight as mab's aethereal palace could afford <\s>
<s> yet likest evening's vault that faery hall <\s>
<s> 30 as heaven low resting on the wave it spread its floors of flashing light its vast and azure dome its fertile golden islands floating on a silver sea 35 whilst suns their mingling beamings darted through clouds of circumambient darkness and pearly battlements around looked o'er the immense of heaven <\s>
<s> the magic car no longer moved <\s>
<s> 40 the fairy and the spirit entered the hall of spells those golden clouds that rolled in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy 45 with the aethereal footsteps trembled not the light and crimson mists floating to strains of thrilling melody through that unearthly dwelling yielded to every movement of the will <\s>
<s> 50 upon their passive swell the spirit leaned and for the varied bliss that pressed around used not the glorious privilege of virtue and of wisdom <\s>
<s> the fairy said 55 and pointed to the gorgeous dome this is a wondrous sight and mocks all human grandeur but were it virtue's only meed to dwell in a celestial palace all resigned 60 to pleasurable impulses immured within the prison of itself the will of changeless nature would be unfulfilled <\s>
<s> learn to make others happy <\s>
<s> this is thine high reward the past shall rise 65 thou shalt behold the present i will teach the secrets of the future <\s>
<s> the fairy and the spirit approached the overhanging battlement below lay stretched the universe <\s>
<s> 70 there far as the remotest line that bounds imagination's flight countless and unending orbs in mazy motion intermingled yet still fulfilled immutably 75 eternal nature's law <\s>
<s> above below around the circling systems formed a wilderness of harmony each with undeviating aim 80 in eloquent silence through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way <\s>
<s> there was a little light that twinkled in the misty distance none but a spirit's eye 85 might ken that rolling orb none but a spirit's eye and in no other place but that celestial dwelling might behold each action of this earth's inhabitants <\s>
<s> 90 but matter space and time in those aereal mansions cease to act and all prevailing wisdom when it reaps the harvest of its excellence o'er bounds those obstacles of which an earthly soul 95 fears to attempt the conquest <\s>
<s> the fairy pointed to the earth <\s>
<s> the spirit's intellectual eye its kindred beings recognized <\s>
<s> the thronging thousands to a passing view 100 seemed like an ant hill's citizens <\s>
<s> that even the passions prejudices interests that sway the meanest being the weak touch that moves the finest nerve 105 and in one human brain causes the faintest thought becomes a link in the great chain of nature <\s>
