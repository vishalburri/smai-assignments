<s> judge what did he say <\s>
<s> as soon as we 180 had bound him on the wheel he smiled on us as one who baffles a deep adversary and holding his breath died <\s>

<s> camillo i overrule 185 further proceedings and in the behalf of these most innocent and noble persons will use my interest with the holy father <\s>
<s> judge let the pope's pleasure then be done <\s>
<s> meanwhile conduct these culprits each to separate cells 190 and be the engines ready for this night if the pope's resolution be as grave pious and just as once i'll wring the truth out of those nerves and sinews groan by groan <\s>
<s> exeunt scene 5.3 the cell of a prison <\s>
<s> beatrice is discovered asleep on a couch <\s>
<s> bernardo how gently slumber rests upon her face like the last thoughts of some day sweetly spent closing in night and dreams and so prolonged <\s>
<s> after such torments as she bore last night how light and soft her breathing comes <\s>
<s> 5 methinks that i shall never sleep again <\s>
<s> but i must shake the heavenly dew of rest from this sweet folded flower thus ... wake awake <\s>
<s> what sister canst thou sleep <\s>
<s> beatrice awaking ]: i was just dreaming that we were all in paradise <\s>
<s> thou knowest 10 this cell seems like a kind of paradise after our father's presence <\s>
<s> bernardo dear dear sister would that thy dream were not a dream <\s>
<s> how shall i tell <\s>
<s> beatrice what wouldst thou tell sweet brother <\s>
<s> bernardo look not so calm and happy or even whilst 15 i stand considering what i have to say my heart will break <\s>
<s> beatrice see now thou mak'st me weep how very friendless thou wouldst be dear child if i were dead <\s>
<s> say what thou hast to say <\s>
<s> bernardo they have confessed they could endure no more 20 the tortures ... <\s>
<s> what was there to confess <\s>
<s> they must have told some weak and wicked lie to flatter their tormentors <\s>
<s> have they said that they were guilty <\s>
<s> o white innocence that thou shouldst wear the mask of guilt to hide 25 thine awful and serenest countenance from those who know thee not <\s>
<s> enter judge with lucretia and giacomo guarded ignoble hearts <\s>
<s> for some brief spasms of pain which are at least as mortal as the limbs through which they pass are centuries of high splendour laid in dust <\s>
<s> 30 and that eternal honour which should live sunlike above the reek of mortal fame changed to a mockery and a byword <\s>
<s> will you give up these bodies to be dragged at horses heels so that our hair should sweep 35 the footsteps of the vain and senseless crowd who that they may make our calamity their worship and their spectacle will leave the churches and the theatres as void as their own hearts <\s>
<s> shall the light multitude 40 fling at their choice curses or faded pity sad funeral flowers to deck a living corpse upon us as we pass to pass away and leave ... what memory of our having been <\s>
<s> infamy blood terror despair <\s>
<s> o thou 45 who wert a mother to the parentless kill not thy child <\s>
<s> let not her wrongs kill thee <\s>
<s> brother lie down with me upon the rack and let us each be silent as a corpse it soon will be as soft as any grave <\s>
<s> 50 tis but the falsehood it can wring from fear makes the rack cruel <\s>
<s> giacomo they will tear the truth even from thee at last those cruel pains for pity's sake say thou art guilty now <\s>
<s> lucretia oh speak the truth <\s>
<s> let us all quickly die 55 and after death god is our judge not they he will have mercy on us <\s>
<s> bernardo if indeed it can be true say so dear sister mine and then the pope will surely pardon you and all be well <\s>
<s> judge confess or i will warp 60 your limbs with such keen tortures ... <\s>
<s> turn the rack henceforth into a spinning wheel <\s>
<s> torture your dog that he may tell when last he lapped the blood his master shed ... not me <\s>
<s> my pangs are of the mind and of the heart 65 and of the soul ay of the inmost soul which weeps within tears as of burning gall to see in this ill world where none are true my kindred false to their deserted selves <\s>
<s> and with considering all the wretched life 70 which i have lived and its now wretched end and the small justice shown by heaven and earth to me or mine and what a tyrant thou art and what slaves these and what a world we make the oppressor and the oppressed ... such pangs compel 75 my answer <\s>
<s> what is it thou wouldst with me <\s>
<s> judge art thou not guilty of thy father's death <\s>
<s> beatrice or wilt thou rather tax high judging god that he permitted such an act as that which i have suffered and which he beheld 80 made it unutterable and took from it all refuge all revenge all consequence but that which thou hast called my father's death <\s>
<s> which is or is not what men call a crime which either i have done or have not done 85 say what ye will <\s>
<s> i shall deny no more <\s>
<s> if ye desire it thus thus let it be and so an end of all <\s>
<s> now do your will no other pains shall force another word <\s>
<s> judge she is convicted but has not confessed <\s>
<s> 90 be it enough <\s>
<s> until their final sentence let none have converse with them <\s>
<s> you young lord linger not here <\s>

<s> officer that is the headsman's business <\s>
<s> 95 exeunt all but lucretia beatrice and giacomo giacomo have i confessed <\s>
<s> is it all over now <\s>
<s> o weak wicked tongue which hast destroyed me would that thou hadst been cut out and thrown to dogs first <\s>
<s> to have killed my father first and then betrayed my sister 100 ay thee <\s>
