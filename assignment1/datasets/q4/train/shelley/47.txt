<s> none may know the sweetness of the joy which made his breath 5 fail like the trances of the summer air when with the lady of his love who then first knew the unreserve of mingled being he walked along the pathway of a field which to the east a hoar wood shadowed o'er 10 but to the west was open to the sky <\s>
<s> there now the sun had sunk but lines of gold hung on the ashen clouds and on the points of the far level grass and nodding flowers and the old dandelion's hoary beard 15 and mingled with the shades of twilight lay on the brown massy woods and in the east the broad and burning moon lingeringly rose between the black trunks of the crowded trees while the faint stars were gathering overhead 20 is it not strange isabel said the youth i never saw the sun <\s>

<s> the awful shadow of some unseen power floats though unseen among us visiting this various world with as inconstant wing as summer winds that creep from flower to flower like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower 5 it visits with inconstant glance each human heart and countenance like hues and harmonies of evening like clouds in starlight widely spread like memory of music fled 10 like aught that for its grace may be dear and yet dearer for its mystery <\s>

<s> 45 depart not as thy shadow came depart not lest the grave should be like life and fear a dark reality <\s>
<s> while yet a boy i sought for ghosts and sped through many a listening chamber cave and ruin 50 and starlight wood with fearful steps pursuing hopes of high talk with the departed dead <\s>
<s> i called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed i was not heard i saw them not when musing deeply on the lot 55 of life at that sweet time when winds are wooing all vital things that wake to bring news of birds and blossoming sudden thy shadow fell on me i shrieked and clasped my hands in ecstasy <\s>

<s> none may know the sweetness of the joy which made his breath 5 fail like the trances of the summer air when with the lady of his love who then first knew the unreserve of mingled being he walked along the pathway of a field which to the east a hoar wood shadowed o'er 10 but to the west was open to the sky <\s>
<s> there now the sun had sunk but lines of gold hung on the ashen clouds and on the points of the far level grass and nodding flowers and the old dandelion's hoary beard 15 and mingled with the shades of twilight lay on the brown massy woods and in the east the broad and burning moon lingeringly rose between the black trunks of the crowded trees while the faint stars were gathering overhead 20 is it not strange isabel said the youth i never saw the sun <\s>

<s> the awful shadow of some unseen power floats though unseen among us visiting this various world with as inconstant wing as summer winds that creep from flower to flower like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower 5 it visits with inconstant glance each human heart and countenance like hues and harmonies of evening like clouds in starlight widely spread like memory of music fled 10 like aught that for its grace may be dear and yet dearer for its mystery <\s>

<s> 45 depart not as thy shadow came depart not lest the grave should be like life and fear a dark reality <\s>
<s> while yet a boy i sought for ghosts and sped through many a listening chamber cave and ruin 50 and starlight wood with fearful steps pursuing hopes of high talk with the departed dead <\s>
<s> i called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed i was not heard i saw them not when musing deeply on the lot 55 of life at that sweet time when winds are wooing all vital things that wake to bring news of birds and blossoming sudden thy shadow fell on me i shrieked and clasped my hands in ecstasy <\s>

<s> note on the early poems by mrs <\s>
<s> the remainder of shelley's poems will be arranged in the order in which they were written <\s>
<s> of course mistakes will occur in placing some of the shorter ones for as i have said many of these were thrown aside and i never saw them till i had the misery of looking over his writings after the hand that traced them was dust and some were in the hands of others and i never saw them till now <\s>
<s> the subjects of the poems are often to me an unerring guide but on other occasions i can only guess by finding them in the pages of the same manuscript book that contains poems with the date of whose composition i am fully conversant <\s>
<s> in the present arrangement all his poetical translations will be placed together at the end <\s>
<s> the loss of his early papers prevents my being able to give any of the poetry of his boyhood <\s>
<s> of the few i give as early poems the greater part were published with alastor some of them were written previously some at the same period <\s>
<s> the poem beginning oh there are spirits in the air was addressed in idea to coleridge whom he never knew and at whose character he could only guess imperfectly through his writings and accounts he heard of him from some who knew him well <\s>
<s> he regarded his change of opinions as rather an act of will than conviction and believed that in his inner heart he would be haunted by what shelley considered the better and holier aspirations of his youth <\s>
<s> the summer evening that suggested to him the poem written in the churchyard of lechlade occurred during his voyage up the thames in 1815 <\s>
<s> he had been advised by a physician to live as much as possible in the open air and a fortnight of a bright warm july was spent in tracing the thames to its source <\s>
<s> he never spent a season more tranquilly than the summer of 1815 <\s>
<s> he had just recovered from a severe pulmonary attack the weather was warm and pleasant <\s>
<s> he lived near windsor forest and his life was spent under its shades or on the water meditating subjects for verse <\s>
<s> hitherto he had chiefly aimed at extending his political doctrines and attempted so to do by appeals in prose essays to the people exhorting them to claim their rights but he had now begun to feel that the time for action was not ripe in england and that the pen was the only instrument wherewith to prepare the way for better things <\s>
<s> in the scanty journals kept during those years i find a record of the books that shelley read during several years <\s>
<s> during the years of 1814 and 1815 the list is extensive <\s>
<s> it includes in greek homer hesiod theocritus the histories of thucydides and herodotus and diogenes laertius <\s>
<s> in latin petronius suetonius some of the works of cicero a large proportion of those of seneca and livy <\s>
<s> in english milton's poems wordsworth's excursion southey's madoc and thalaba locke on the human understanding bacon's novum organum <\s>
<s> in italian ariosto tasso and alfieri <\s>
<s> in french the reveries d'un solitaire of rousseau <\s>
<s> to these may be added several modern books of travel <\s>
<s> he read few novels <\s>

<s> lines 9 20 and 28 42 appeared in hunt's literary pocket book 1823 under the titles respectively of sunset <\s>
<s> from an unpublished poem and grief <\s>
<s> a fragment there late was one within whose subtle being as light and wind within some delicate cloud that fades amid the blue noon's burning sky genius and death contended <\s>
<s> none may know the sweetness of the joy which made his breath 5 fail like the trances of the summer air when with the lady of his love who then first knew the unreserve of mingled being he walked along the pathway of a field which to the east a hoar wood shadowed o'er 10 but to the west was open to the sky <\s>
<s> there now the sun had sunk but lines of gold hung on the ashen clouds and on the points of the far level grass and nodding flowers and the old dandelion's hoary beard 15 and mingled with the shades of twilight lay on the brown massy woods and in the east the broad and burning moon lingeringly rose between the black trunks of the crowded trees while the faint stars were gathering overhead 20 is it not strange isabel said the youth i never saw the sun <\s>
<s> we will walk here to morrow thou shalt look on it with me <\s>
<s> that night the youth and lady mingled lay in love and sleep but when the morning came 25 the lady found her lover dead and cold <\s>
<s> let none believe that god in mercy gave that stroke <\s>
<s> the lady died not nor grew wild but year by year lived on in truth i think her gentleness and patience and sad smiles 30 and that she did not die but lived to tend her aged father were a kind of madness if madness tis to be unlike the world <\s>
<s> for but to see her were to read the tale woven by some subtlest bard to make hard hearts 35 dissolve away in wisdom working grief her eyes were black and lustreless and wan her eyelashes were worn away with tears her lips and cheeks were like things dead so pale her hands were thin and through their wandering veins 40 and weak articulations might be seen day's ruddy light <\s>
<s> the tomb of thy dead self which one vexed ghost inhabits night and day is all lost child that now remains of thee <\s>
<s> inheritor of more than earth can give 45 passionless calm and silence unreproved whether the dead find oh not sleep <\s>
<s> but rest and are the uncomplaining things they seem or live or drop in the deep sea of love oh that like thine mine epitaph were peace <\s>

<s> the awful shadow of some unseen power floats though unseen among us visiting this various world with as inconstant wing as summer winds that creep from flower to flower like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower 5 it visits with inconstant glance each human heart and countenance like hues and harmonies of evening like clouds in starlight widely spread like memory of music fled 10 like aught that for its grace may be dear and yet dearer for its mystery <\s>
<s> spirit of beauty that dost consecrate with thine own hues all thou dost shine upon of human thought or form where art thou gone <\s>
<s> 15 why dost thou pass away and leave our state this dim vast vale of tears vacant and desolate <\s>
<s> ask why the sunlight not for ever weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain river why aught should fail and fade that once is shown 20 why fear and dream and death and birth cast on the daylight of this earth such gloom why man has such a scope for love and hate despondency and hope <\s>
<s> no voice from some sublimer world hath ever 25 to sage or poet these responses given therefore the names of demon ghost and heaven <\s>
<s> remain the records of their vain endeavour frail spells whose uttered charm might not avail to sever from all we hear and all we see 30 doubt chance and mutability <\s>
<s> thy light alone like mist o'er mountains driven or music by the night wind sent through strings of some still instrument or moonlight on a midnight stream 35 gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream <\s>
<s> love hope and self esteem like clouds depart and come for some uncertain moments lent <\s>
<s> man were immortal and omnipotent didst thou unknown and awful as thou art 40 keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart <\s>
<s> thou messenger of sympathies that wax and wane in lovers eyes thou that to human thought art nourishment like darkness to a dying flame <\s>
<s> 45 depart not as thy shadow came depart not lest the grave should be like life and fear a dark reality <\s>
<s> while yet a boy i sought for ghosts and sped through many a listening chamber cave and ruin 50 and starlight wood with fearful steps pursuing hopes of high talk with the departed dead <\s>
<s> i called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed i was not heard i saw them not when musing deeply on the lot 55 of life at that sweet time when winds are wooing all vital things that wake to bring news of birds and blossoming sudden thy shadow fell on me i shrieked and clasped my hands in ecstasy <\s>
<s> i vowed that i would dedicate my powers to thee and thine have i not kept the vow <\s>
<s> with beating heart and streaming eyes even now i call the phantoms of a thousand hours each from his voiceless grave they have in visioned bowers 65 of studious zeal or love's delight outwatched with me the envious night they know that never joy illumed my brow unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free this world from its dark slavery 70 that thou o awful loveliness wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express <\s>
<s> the day becomes more solemn and serene when noon is past there is a harmony in autumn and a lustre in its sky 75 which through the summer is not heard or seen as if it could not be as if it had not been <\s>
<s> thus let thy power which like the truth of nature on my passive youth descended to my onward life supply 80 its calm to one who worships thee and every form containing thee whom spirit fair thy spells did bind to fear himself and love all human kind <\s>

<s> the everlasting universe of things flows through the mind and rolls its rapid waves now dark now glittering now reflecting gloom now lending splendour where from secret springs the source of human thought its tribute brings 5 of waters with a sound but half its own such as a feeble brook will oft assume in the wild woods among the mountains lone where waterfalls around it leap for ever where woods and winds contend and a vast river 10 over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves <\s>
<s> thus thou ravine of arve dark deep ravine thou many coloured many voiced vale over whose pines and crags and caverns sail fast cloud shadows and sunbeams awful scene 15 where power in likeness of the arve comes down from the ice gulfs that gird his secret throne bursting through these dark mountains like the flame of lightning through the tempest thou dost lie thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging 20 children of elder time in whose devotion the chainless winds still come and ever came to drink their odours and their mighty swinging to hear an old and solemn harmony thine earthly rainbows stretched across the sweep 25 of the ethereal waterfall whose veil robes some unsculptured image the strange sleep which when the voices of the desert fail wraps all in its own deep eternity thy caverns echoing to the arve's commotion 30 a loud lone sound no other sound can tame thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion thou art the path of that unresting sound dizzy ravine <\s>
<s> and when i gaze on thee i seem as in a trance sublime and strange 35 to muse on my own separate fantasy my own my human mind which passively now renders and receives fast influencings holding an unremitting interchange with the clear universe of things around 40 one legion of wild thoughts whose wandering wings now float above thy darkness and now rest where that or thou art no unbidden guest in the still cave of the witch poesy seeking among the shadows that pass by 45 ghosts of all things that are some shade of thee some phantom some faint image till the breast from which they fled recalls them thou art there <\s>
<s> some say that gleams of a remoter world visit the soul in sleep that death is slumber 50 and that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber of those who wake and live i look on high has some unknown omnipotence unfurled the veil of life and death <\s>
<s> or do i lie in dream and does the mightier world of sleep 55 spread far around and inaccessibly its circles <\s>
