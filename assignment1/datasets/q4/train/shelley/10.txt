<s> that night we anchored in a woody bay and sleep no more around us dared to hover 3470 than when all doubt and fear has passed away it shades the couch of some unresting lover whose heart is now at rest thus night passed over in mutual joy around a forest grew of poplars and dark oaks whose shade did cover 3475 the waning stars pranked in the waters blue and trembled in the wind which from the morning flew <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>

<s> i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toil worn mariners 3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears 3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and half extinguished words which prophesied of change <\s>
<s> for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountain's pyramid 3525 points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove <\s>

<s> our many thoughts and deeds our life and love 3730 our happiness and all that we have been immortally must live and burn and move when we shall be no more the world has seen a type of peace and as some most serene and lovely spot to a poor maniac's eye 3735 after long years some sweet and moving scene of youthful hope returning suddenly quells his long madness thus man shall remember thee <\s>
<s> and calumny meanwhile shall feed on us as worms devour the dead and near the throne 3740 and at the altar most accepted thus shall sneers and curses be what we have done none shall dare vouch though it be truly known that record shall remain when they must pass who built their pride on its oblivion 3745 and fame in human hope which sculptured was survive the perished scrolls of unenduring brass <\s>
<s> the while we two beloved must depart and sense and reason those enchanters fair whose wand of power is hope would bid the heart 3750 that gazed beyond the wormy grave despair these eyes these lips this blood seems darkly there to fade in hideous ruin no calm sleep peopling with golden dreams the stagnant air seems our obscure and rotting eyes to steep 3755 in joy but senseless death a ruin dark and deep <\s>
<s> these are blind fancies reason cannot know what sense can neither feel nor thought conceive there is delusion in the world and woe and fear and pain we know not whence we live 3760 or why or how or what mute power may give their being to each plant and star and beast or even these thoughts come near me <\s>
<s> i do weave a chain i cannot break i am possessed with thoughts too swift and strong for one lone human breast <\s>

<s> alas our thoughts flow on with stream whose waters 3775 return not to their fountain earth and heaven the ocean and the sun the clouds their daughters winter and spring and morn and noon and even all that we are or know is darkly driven towards one gulf lo <\s>
