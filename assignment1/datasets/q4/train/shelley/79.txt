<s> he who asserts the doctrine of necessity means that contemplating the events which compose the moral and material universe he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy or act in any other place than it does act <\s>
<s> the idea of necessity is obtained by our experience of the connection between objects the uniformity of the operations of nature the constant conjunction of similar events and the consequent inference of one from the other <\s>
<s> mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action <\s>
<s> motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe <\s>
<s> the word liberty as applied to mind is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents <\s>
<s> every human being is irresistibly impelled to act precisely as he does act in the eternity which preceded his birth a chain of causes was generated which operating under the name of motives make it impossible that any thought of his mind or any action of his life should be otherwise than it is <\s>
<s> were the doctrine of necessity false the human mind would no longer be a legitimate object of science from like causes it would be in vain that we should expect like effects the strongest motive would no longer be paramount over the conduct all knowledge would be vague and undeterminate we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet as an enemy to morrow him with whom we have parted in friendship to night the most probable inducements and the clearest reasonings would lose the invariable influence they possess <\s>
<s> the contrary of this is demonstrably the fact <\s>
<s> similar circumstances produce the same unvariable effects <\s>
<s> the precise character and motives of any man on any occasion being given the moral philosopher could predict his actions with as much certainty as the natural philosopher could predict the effects of the mixture of any particular chemical substances <\s>
<s> why is the aged husbandman more experienced than the young beginner <\s>
<s> because there is a uniform undeniable necessity in the operations of the material universe <\s>
<s> why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician because relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action he proceeds to produce moral effects by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual <\s>
<s> some actions may be found to which we can attach no motives but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted <\s>
<s> hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect nor placed in this point of view is it or ever has it been the subject of popular or philosophical dispute <\s>
<s> none but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their god with the misery of man will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause a voluntary action without a motive <\s>
<s> history politics morals criticism all grounds of reasonings all principles of science alike assume the truth of the doctrine of necessity <\s>
<s> no farmer carrying his corn to market doubts the sale of it at the market price <\s>
<s> the master of a manufactory no more doubts that he can purchase the human labour necessary for his purposes than that his machinery will act as they have been accustomed to act <\s>
<s> but whilst none have scrupled to admit necessity as influencing matter many have disputed its dominion over mind <\s>
<s> independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of god it is by no means obvious to a superficial inquiry <\s>
<s> when the mind observes its own operations it feels no connection of motive and action but as we know nothing more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other as we find that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes <\s>
<s> the actions of the will have a regular conjunction with circumstances and characters motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect <\s>
<s> but the only idea we can form of causation is a constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference of one from the other wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established <\s>
<s> the idea of liberty applied metaphorically to the will has sprung from a misconception of the meaning of the word power <\s>
<s> what is power id quod potest that which can produce any given effect <\s>
<s> to deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act <\s>
<s> in the only true sense of the word power it applies with equal force to the lodestone as to the human will <\s>
<s> do you think these motives which i shall present are powerful enough to rouse him <\s>
<s> is a question just as common as do you think this lever has the power of raising this weight <\s>
<s> the advocates of free will assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive but the strongest motive is that which overcoming all others ultimately prevails this assertion therefore amounts to a denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it which is absurd <\s>
<s> but it is equally certain that a man cannot resist the strongest motive as that he cannot overcome a physical impossibility <\s>
<s> the doctrine of necessity tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality and utterly to destroy religion <\s>
<s> reward and punishment must be considered by the necessarian merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct <\s>
<s> desert in the present sense of the word would no longer have any meaning and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice <\s>
<s> it is not enough says the advocate of free will that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime he should feel pain and his torments when justly inflicted ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault <\s>
<s> but utility is morality that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless and though the crime of damiens must be condemned yet the frightful torments which revenge under the name of justice inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented even at the long run the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world <\s>
<s> at the same time the doctrine of necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice <\s>
<s> the conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal and that a tiger is constrained by the inevitable condition of his existence to devour men does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously or even more to hesitate in destroying them but he would surely be of a hard heart who meeting with a serpent on a desert island or in a situation where it was incapable of injury should wantonly deprive it of existence <\s>
<s> a necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes whilst cowardice curiosity and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of free will <\s>
<s> religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe <\s>
<s> but if the principle of the universe be not an organic being the model and prototype of man the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none <\s>
<s> without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain <\s>
<s> but will is only a mode of animal mind moral qualities also are such as only a human being can possess to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible definition of its nature <\s>
<s> it is probable that the word god was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe <\s>
<s> by the vulgar mistake of a metaphor for a real being of a word for a thing it became a man endowed with human qualities and governing the universe as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom <\s>
<s> their addresses to this imaginary being indeed are much in the same style as those of subjects to a king <\s>
<s> they acknowledge his benevolence deprecate his anger and supplicate his favour <\s>
<s> but the doctrine of necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen and that if god is the author of good he is also the author of evil that if he is entitled to our gratitude for the one he is entitled to our hatred for the other that admitting the existence of this hypothetic being he is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity <\s>
<s> it is plain that the same arguments which prove that god is the author of food light and life prove him also to be the author of poison darkness and death <\s>
<s> the wide wasting earthquake the storm the battle and the tyranny are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature sunshine liberty and peace <\s>
<s> but we are taught by the doctrine of necessity that there is neither good nor evil in the universe otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being <\s>
<s> still less than with the hypothesis of a god will the doctrine of necessity accord with the belief of a future state of punishment <\s>
<s> god made man such as he is and than damned him for being so for to say that god was the author of all good and man the author of all evil is to say that one man made a straight line and a crooked one and another man made the incongruity <\s>
<s> a mahometan story much to the present purpose is recorded wherein adam and moses are introduced disputing before god in the following manner <\s>
<s> thou says moses art adam whom god created and animated with the breath of life and caused to be worshipped by the angels and placed in paradise from whence mankind have been expelled for thy fault <\s>
<s> whereto adam answered thou art moses whom god chose for his apostle and entrusted with his word by giving thee the tables of the law and whom he vouchsafed to admit to discourse with himself <\s>
<s> how many years dost thou find the law was written before i was created <\s>
<s> and dost thou not find replied adam these words therein and adam rebelled against his lord and transgressed <\s>
<s> which moses confessing dost thou therefore blame me continued he for doing that which god wrote of me that i should do forty years before i was created nay for what was decreed concerning me fifty thousand years before the creation of heaven and earth sale's prelim <\s>

<s> 13 there is no god <\s>
<s> this negation must be understood solely to affect a creative deity <\s>
<s> the hypothesis of a pervading spirit co eternal with the universe remains unshaken <\s>
<s> a close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition is the only secure way of attaining truth on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant our knowledge of the existence of a deity is a subject of such importance that it cannot be too minutely investigated in consequence of this conviction we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced <\s>
<s> it is necessary first to consider the nature of belief <\s>
<s> when a proposition is offered to the mind it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed <\s>
<s> a perception of their agreement is termed belief <\s>
<s> many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct <\s>
<s> the mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each which is passive the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief that belief is an act of volition in consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind <\s>
<s> pursuing continuing this mistake they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief of which in its nature it is incapable it is equally incapable of merit <\s>
<s> belief then is a passion the strength of which like every other passion is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement <\s>
<s> the degrees of excitement are three <\s>
<s> the senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent <\s>
<s> the decision of the mind founded upon our own experience derived from these sources claims the next degree <\s>
<s> the experience of others which addresses itself to the former one occupies the lowest degree <\s>
<s> a graduated scale on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason reason is founded on the evidence of our senses <\s>
<s> every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them which should convince us of the existence of a deity <\s>
<s> 1st the evidence of the senses <\s>
<s> if the deity should appear to us if he should convince our senses of his existence this revelation would necessarily command belief <\s>
<s> those to whom the deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of his existence <\s>
<s> but the god of theologians is incapable of local visibility <\s>
<s> it is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had a beginning or have existed from all eternity he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause <\s>
<s> when this reasoning is applied to the universe it is necessary to prove that it was created until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity <\s>
<s> we must prove design before we can infer a designer <\s>
<s> the only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other <\s>
<s> in a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen <\s>
<s> the other argument which is founded on a man's knowledge of his own existence stands thus <\s>
