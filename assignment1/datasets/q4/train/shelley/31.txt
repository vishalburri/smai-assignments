<s> note on the mask of anarchy by mrs <\s>
<s> though shelley's first eager desire to excite his countrymen to resist openly the oppressions existent during the good old times had faded with early youth still his warmest sympathies were for the people <\s>
<s> he was a republican and loved a democracy <\s>
<s> he looked on all human beings as inheriting an equal right to possess the dearest privileges of our nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction <\s>
<s> his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people as not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense <\s>
<s> he was residing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion <\s>
<s> the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few as was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist <\s>
<s> inspired by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor <\s>
<s> i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and interesting preface to this poem when he printed it in 1832 because i thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse <\s>
<s> days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious <\s>
<s> without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day <\s>
<s> but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelley's abhorrence <\s>
<s> the poem was written for the people and is therefore in a more popular tone than usual portions strike as abrupt and unpolished but many stanzas are all his own <\s>
<s> i heard him repeat and admired those beginning my father time is old and gray before i knew to what poem they were to belong <\s>
<s> but the most touching passage is that which describes the blessed effects of liberty it might make a patriot of any man whose heart was not wholly closed against his humbler fellow creatures <\s>

<s> note on the mask of anarchy by mrs <\s>
<s> though shelley's first eager desire to excite his countrymen to resist openly the oppressions existent during the good old times had faded with early youth still his warmest sympathies were for the people <\s>
<s> he was a republican and loved a democracy <\s>
<s> he looked on all human beings as inheriting an equal right to possess the dearest privileges of our nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction <\s>
<s> his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people as not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense <\s>
<s> he was residing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion <\s>
<s> the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few as was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist <\s>
<s> inspired by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor <\s>
<s> i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and interesting preface to this poem when he printed it in 1832 because i thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse <\s>
<s> days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious <\s>
<s> without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day <\s>
<s> but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelley's abhorrence <\s>
<s> the poem was written for the people and is therefore in a more popular tone than usual portions strike as abrupt and unpolished but many stanzas are all his own <\s>
<s> i heard him repeat and admired those beginning my father time is old and gray before i knew to what poem they were to belong <\s>

<s> note on the mask of anarchy by mrs <\s>
<s> though shelley's first eager desire to excite his countrymen to resist openly the oppressions existent during the good old times had faded with early youth still his warmest sympathies were for the people <\s>
<s> he was a republican and loved a democracy <\s>
<s> he looked on all human beings as inheriting an equal right to possess the dearest privileges of our nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction <\s>
<s> his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people as not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense <\s>
<s> he was residing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion <\s>
<s> the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few as was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist <\s>
<s> inspired by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor <\s>
<s> i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and interesting preface to this poem when he printed it in 1832 because i thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse <\s>
<s> days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious <\s>
<s> without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day <\s>
<s> but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelley's abhorrence <\s>
<s> the poem was written for the people and is therefore in a more popular tone than usual portions strike as abrupt and unpolished but many stanzas are all his own <\s>
<s> i heard him repeat and admired those beginning my father time is old and gray before i knew to what poem they were to belong <\s>
<s> but the most touching passage is that which describes the blessed effects of liberty it might make a patriot of any man whose heart was not wholly closed against his humbler fellow creatures <\s>
