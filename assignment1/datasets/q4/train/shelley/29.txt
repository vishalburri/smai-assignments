<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>

<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>

<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>

<s> note on the cenci by mrs <\s>
<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>

<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>

<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>

<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>

<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>

<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>

<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>

<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>

<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>

<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>

<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> note on the cenci by mrs <\s>
<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>

<s> note on the cenci by mrs <\s>
<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>

<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>

<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>

<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>

<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>

<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>

<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>

<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>

<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>

<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>

<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>

<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> note on the cenci by mrs <\s>
<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>

<s> note on the cenci by mrs <\s>
<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>

<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>

<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>

<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>

<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>

<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>

<s> the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one <\s>
<s> he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost <\s>
<s> i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twenty six at which he wrote the cenci <\s>
<s> on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent <\s>
<s> he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and following up a story or plot <\s>
<s> he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry <\s>
<s> he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian <\s>
<s> it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse <\s>
<s> once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation <\s>
<s> the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i <\s>
<s> i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes <\s>
<s> the second volume of st <\s>
<s> leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute <\s>
<s> shakespeare was only a human being <\s>
<s> these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted <\s>
<s> when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci <\s>
<s> we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story <\s>
<s> shelley's imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy <\s>
<s> more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language <\s>
<s> this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress <\s>
<s> we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together <\s>
<s> i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind <\s>
<s> we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts <\s>
<s> we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss <\s>
<s> such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blue eyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about half way between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer <\s>
<s> our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the water wheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed <\s>
<s> at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace <\s>
<s> there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed <\s>
<s> this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea <\s>
<s> the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water spouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest <\s>
<s> at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence <\s>
<s> in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci <\s>
<s> he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year <\s>
<s> he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio <\s>
<s> shelley wished the cenci to be acted <\s>
<s> he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad filling up of the inferior parts <\s>
<s> while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss o'neil several times <\s>
<s> she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed <\s>
<s> she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine <\s>
<s> with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you <\s>
<s> i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic <\s>
<s> i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably <\s>
<s> it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development <\s>
<s> i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage <\s>
<s> i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it <\s>
<s> in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cenci's worst crime <\s>
<s> every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cenci's curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not <\s>
<s> i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment <\s>
<s> i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point <\s>
<s> indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success <\s>
<s> after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes <\s>
<s> what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden <\s>
<s> the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss o'neil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces ); and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden <\s>
<s> the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play <\s>
<s> that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor <\s>
<s> the play was accordingly sent to mr <\s>
<s> he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss o'neil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept <\s>
<s> shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press <\s>
<s> universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times <\s>
<s> writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words <\s>
<s> there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl <\s>
<s> the fifth act is a masterpiece <\s>
<s> it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet <\s>
<s> the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heart reaching eloquence <\s>
<s> every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones <\s>
<s> it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture <\s>
<s> his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius <\s>
<s> but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul <\s>
