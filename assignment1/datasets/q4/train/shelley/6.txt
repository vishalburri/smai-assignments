<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>

<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>

<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>

<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>
<s> i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years <\s>
<s> yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears 95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally <\s>
<s> they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth 100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child <\s>
<s> i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame 105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name <\s>
<s> one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years 110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares 115 like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place <\s>
<s> truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind <\s>
<s> if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind 120 on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend <\s>
<s> can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world's tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight 125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>

<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>

<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>
<s> i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years <\s>
<s> yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears 95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally <\s>
<s> they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth 100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child <\s>
<s> i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame 105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name <\s>
<s> one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years 110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares 115 like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place <\s>
<s> truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind <\s>
<s> if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind 120 on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend <\s>
<s> can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world's tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight 125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>

<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>

<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>

<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>

<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>

<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>
<s> i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years <\s>
<s> yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears 95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally <\s>
<s> they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth 100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child <\s>
<s> i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame 105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name <\s>
<s> one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years 110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares 115 like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place <\s>
<s> truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind <\s>
<s> if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind 120 on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend <\s>
<s> can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world's tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight 125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>

<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>

<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>

<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>

<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>

<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>
<s> i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years <\s>
<s> yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears 95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally <\s>
<s> they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth 100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child <\s>
<s> i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame 105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name <\s>
<s> one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years 110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares 115 like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place <\s>
<s> truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind <\s>
<s> if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind 120 on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend <\s>
<s> can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world's tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight 125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>

<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>

<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>

<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>

<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>

<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>
<s> i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years <\s>
<s> yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears 95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally <\s>
<s> they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth 100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child <\s>
<s> i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame 105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name <\s>
<s> one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years 110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares 115 like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place <\s>
<s> truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind <\s>
<s> if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind 120 on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend <\s>
<s> can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world's tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight 125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>

<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>

<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>

<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>

<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>

<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>

<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>

<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>

<s> when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory 130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken <\s>
<s> so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep 140 the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground <\s>
<s> tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps 145 earth and the ocean <\s>
<s> the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by <\s>
<s> 150 there is a pause the sea birds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has fall'n on earth what light is in the sky <\s>
<s> for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen 155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between 160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed <\s>
<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>
<s> i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue 175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear <\s>
<s> even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour 185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm <\s>
<s> a course precipitous of dizzy speed 190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight <\s>
<s> for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood 195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide air's solitude <\s>
<s> a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein 200 feather and scale inextricably blended <\s>
<s> the serpent's mailed and many coloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin 205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagle's steadfast eye <\s>
<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>
<s> what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray <\s>
<s> for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the sea's suspended spray 220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap where'er the eagle's talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep <\s>
<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
<s> yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza <\s>
<s> but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly <\s>
<s> it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame <\s>
<s> they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes <\s>
<s> this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not <\s>
<s> poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together <\s>
<s> longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace <\s>
<s> yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own <\s>
<s> i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure <\s>
<s> i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace <\s>
<s> i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak <\s>
<s> i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public <\s>
<s> if certain critics were as clear sighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings <\s>
<s> as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives <\s>
<s> should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless <\s>
<s> i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce <\s>
<s> it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great <\s>
<s> these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream <\s>
<s> were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty minded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe <\s>
<s> the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions <\s>
<s> the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition <\s>
<s> that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands <\s>
<s> i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow <\s>
<s> but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind <\s>
<s> and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years <\s>
<s> i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own <\s>
<s> the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself <\s>
<s> the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own <\s>
<s> in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations <\s>
<s> there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice <\s>
<s> love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world <\s>
<s> there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is there's not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman <\s>
<s> so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart's home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become 5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light <\s>
<s> the toil which stole from thee so many an hour 10 is ended and the fruit is at thy feet <\s>
<s> no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green 15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been <\s>
<s> thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass <\s>
<s> 20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit's sleep <\s>
<s> a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas <\s>
<s> 25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes <\s>
<s> and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground 30 so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check <\s>
<s> i then controlled 35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold <\s>
<s> and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store 40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined <\s>
<s> alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone 50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee <\s>
<s> thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart 55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among 60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long <\s>
<s> no more alone through the world's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent 65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood <\s>
<s> now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power 75 which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn <\s>
<s> and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me 80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee <\s>
<s> is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain <\s>
<s> or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again 85 though it might shake the anarch custom's reign and charm the minds of men to truth's own sway holier than was amphion's <\s>
<s> i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey <\s>
<s> and what art thou <\s>
<s> i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years <\s>
<s> yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears 95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally <\s>
<s> they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth 100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child <\s>
<s> i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame 105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name <\s>
<s> one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years 110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares 115 like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place <\s>
<s> truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind <\s>
<s> if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind 120 on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend <\s>
<s> can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world's tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight 125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light <\s>

<s> for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce 165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon 170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon <\s>

<s> around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing 210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek 215 upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak <\s>

<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>

<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>

<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>

<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>

<s> swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemy's neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil 230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory <\s>
<s> then on the white edge of the bursting surge 235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings 240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs <\s>
<s> wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event 245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while o'er the continent 250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast <\s>
<s> and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion 255 of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the sea shore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found 260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound <\s>
<s> there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand 265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had fall'n and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the sea mark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate <\s>
<s> it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow 275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foam wreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea <\s>
<s> and when she saw the wounded serpent make 280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her star bright robe and shadowy hair 285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air <\s>
<s> she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth <\s>
<s> i heard alone 290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on 295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet <\s>
<s> then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain 300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play o'er its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey 305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay <\s>
<s> then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark red air 310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent o'er the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep <\s>
<s> her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago <\s>
<s> shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go <\s>
<s> his head is on her heart and who can know 320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay 23 <\s>
<s> a boat of rare device which had no sail 325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now 330 we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as o'er the waves we go <\s>
<s> and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream 335 as makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale <\s>
<s> twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam 340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent <\s>
<s> speak not to me but hear <\s>
<s> much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark future's ever flowing urn 345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers o'er mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal all pervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought 350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought <\s>
<s> the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos <\s>
<s> afar o'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar 355 a blood red comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brother's blood <\s>
<s> thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning o'er a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro 365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled <\s>
