<s> i do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest contemporary poets <\s>
<s> yet i am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of any who have preceded me <\s>
<s> i have sought to avoid the imitation of any style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of which it is the character designing that even if what i have produced be worthless it should still be properly my own <\s>
<s> nor have i permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of the reader from whatever interest i may have succeeded in creating to my own ingenuity in contriving to disgust them according to the rules of criticism <\s>
<s> i have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared to me the most obvious and appropriate language <\s>
<s> a person familiar with nature and with the most celebrated productions of the human mind can scarcely err in following the instinct with respect to selection of language produced by that familiarity <\s>
<s> there is an education peculiarly fitted for a poet without which genius and sensibility can hardly fill the circle of their capacities <\s>
<s> no education indeed can entitle to this appellation a dull and unobservant mind or one though neither dull nor unobservant in which the channels of communication between thought and expression have been obstructed or closed <\s>
<s> how far it is my fortune to belong to either of the latter classes i cannot know <\s>
<s> i aspire to be something better <\s>
<s> the circumstances of my accidental education have been favourable to this ambition <\s>
<s> i have been familiar from boyhood with mountains and lakes and the sea and the solitude of forests danger which sports upon the brink of precipices has been my playmate <\s>
<s> i have trodden the glaciers of the alps and lived under the eye of mont blanc <\s>
<s> i have been a wanderer among distant fields <\s>
<s> i have sailed down mighty rivers and seen the sun rise and set and the stars come forth whilst i have sailed night and day down a rapid stream among mountains <\s>
<s> i have seen populous cities and have watched the passions which rise and spread and sink and change amongst assembled multitudes of men <\s>
<s> i have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages of tyranny and war cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless houses and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon their desolated thresholds <\s>
<s> i have conversed with living men of genius <\s>
<s> the poetry of ancient greece and rome and modern italy and our own country has been to me like external nature a passion and an enjoyment <\s>
<s> such are the sources from which the materials for the imagery of my poem have been drawn <\s>
<s> i have considered poetry in its most comprehensive sense and have read the poets and the historians and the metaphysicians in this sense there may be such a thing as perfectibility in works of fiction notwithstanding the concession often made by the advocates of human improvement that perfectibility is a term applicable only to science whose writings have been accessible to me and have looked upon the beautiful and majestic scenery of the earth as common sources of those elements which it is the province of the poet to embody and combine <\s>
<s> yet the experience and the feelings to which i refer do not in themselves constitute men poets but only prepares them to be the auditors of those who are <\s>
<s> how far i shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of poetry the power of awakening in others sensations like those which animate my own bosom is that which to speak sincerely i know not and which with an acquiescent and contented spirit i expect to be taught by the effect which i shall produce upon those whom i now address <\s>
<s> i have avoided as i have said before the imitation of any contemporary style <\s>
<s> but there must be a resemblance which does not depend upon their own will between all the writers of any particular age <\s>
<s> they cannot escape from subjection to a common influence which arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live though each is in a degree the author of the very influence by which his being is thus pervaded <\s>
<s> thus the tragic poets of the age of pericles the italian revivers of ancient learning those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded the reformation the translators of the bible shakespeare spenser the dramatists of the reign of elizabeth and lord bacon milton stands alone in the age which he illumined ); the colder spirits of the interval that succeeded all resemble each other and differ from every other in their several classes <\s>
<s> in this view of things ford can no more be called the imitator of shakespeare than shakespeare the imitator of ford <\s>
<s> there were perhaps few other points of resemblance between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable influence of their age produced <\s>
<s> and this is an influence which neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any era can escape and which i have not attempted to escape <\s>
<s> i have adopted the stanza of spenser a measure inexpressibly beautiful not because i consider it a finer model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of shakespeare and milton but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity you must either succeed or fail <\s>
<s> this perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire <\s>
<s> but i was enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure <\s>
