<s> if i were one whom the loud world held wise i should disdain to quote authorities in commendation of this kind of love why there is first the god in heaven above 30 who wrote a book called nature tis to be reviewed i hear in the next quarterly and socrates the jesus christ of greece and jesus christ himself did never cease to urge all living things to love each other 35 and to forgive their mutual faults and smother the devil of disunion in their souls <\s>
