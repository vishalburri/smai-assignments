<s> on one side of this jagged and shapeless hill there is a cave from which there eddies up a pale mist like aereal gossamer 20 whose breath destroys all life awhile it veils the rock then scattered by the wind it flies along the stream or lingers on the clefts killing the sleepy worms if aught bide there <\s>

<s> 55 in times long past when fair eurydice with her bright eyes sat listening by his side he gently sang of high and heavenly themes <\s>
<s> as in a brook fretted with little waves by the light airs of spring each riplet makes 60 a many sided mirror for the sun while it flows musically through green banks ceaseless and pauseless ever clear and fresh so flowed his song reflecting the deep joy and tender love that fed those sweetest notes 65 the heavenly offspring of ambrosial food <\s>

<s> as in a brook fretted with little waves by the light airs of spring each riplet makes 60 a many sided mirror for the sun while it flows musically through green banks ceaseless and pauseless ever clear and fresh so flowed his song reflecting the deep joy and tender love that fed those sweetest notes 65 the heavenly offspring of ambrosial food <\s>

<s> from yonder pointed hill crowned with a ring of oaks you may behold a dark and barren field through which there flows sluggish and black a deep but narrow stream which the wind ripples not and the fair moon 5 gazes in vain and finds no mirror there <\s>
<s> follow the herbless banks of that strange brook until you pause beside a darksome pond the fountain of this rivulet whose gush cannot be seen hid by a rayless night 10 that lives beneath the overhanging rock that shades the pool an endless spring of gloom upon whose edge hovers the tender light trembling to mingle with its paramour but as syrinx fled pan so night flies day 15 or with most sullen and regardless hate refuses stern her heaven born embrace <\s>
<s> on one side of this jagged and shapeless hill there is a cave from which there eddies up a pale mist like aereal gossamer 20 whose breath destroys all life awhile it veils the rock then scattered by the wind it flies along the stream or lingers on the clefts killing the sleepy worms if aught bide there <\s>
<s> upon the beetling edge of that dark rock 25 there stands a group of cypresses not such as with a graceful spire and stirring life pierce the pure heaven of your native vale whose branches the air plays among but not disturbs fearing to spoil their solemn grace 30 but blasted and all wearily they stand one to another clinging their weak boughs sigh as the wind buffets them and they shake beneath its blasts a weatherbeaten crew <\s>

<s> chorus does he still sing <\s>

<s> as a poor hunted stag a moment shudders on the fearful brink of a swift stream the cruel hounds press on with deafening yell the arrows glance and wound he plunges in so orpheus seized and torn 50 by the sharp fangs of an insatiate grief maenad like waved his lyre in the bright air and wildly shrieked where she is it is dark <\s>
<s> and then he struck from forth the strings a sound of deep and fearful melody <\s>
<s> 55 in times long past when fair eurydice with her bright eyes sat listening by his side he gently sang of high and heavenly themes <\s>
<s> as in a brook fretted with little waves by the light airs of spring each riplet makes 60 a many sided mirror for the sun while it flows musically through green banks ceaseless and pauseless ever clear and fresh so flowed his song reflecting the deep joy and tender love that fed those sweetest notes 65 the heavenly offspring of ambrosial food <\s>
<s> but that is past <\s>
<s> returning from drear hell he chose a lonely seat of unhewn stone blackened with lichens on a herbless plain <\s>
<s> then from the deep and overflowing spring 70 of his eternal ever moving grief there rose to heaven a sound of angry song <\s>
<s> tis as a mighty cataract that parts two sister rocks with waters swift and strong 75 and casts itself with horrid roar and din adown a steep from a perennial source it ever flows and falls and breaks the air with loud and fierce but most harmonious roar and as it falls casts up a vaporous spray which the sun clothes in hues of iris light <\s>
