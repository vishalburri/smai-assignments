<s> stab her or give her bread it was a tone 1955 such as sick fancies in a new made grave might hear <\s>
<s> i trembled for the truth was known he with this child had thus been left alone and neither had gone forth for food but he in mingled pride and awe cowered near his throne 1960 and she a nursling of captivity knew nought beyond those walls nor what such change might be <\s>
<s> and he was troubled at a charm withdrawn thus suddenly that sceptres ruled no more that even from gold the dreadful strength was gone 1965 which once made all things subject to its power such wonder seized him as if hour by hour the past had come again and the swift fall of one so great and terrible of yore to desolateness in the hearts of all 1970 like wonder stirred who saw such awful change befall <\s>
<s> a mighty crowd such as the wide land pours once in a thousand years now gathered round the fallen tyrant like the rush of showers of hail in spring pattering along the ground 1975 their many footsteps fell else came no sound from the wide multitude that lonely man then knew the burden of his change and found concealing in the dust his visage wan refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran <\s>
<s> and he was faint withal i sate beside him upon the earth and took that child so fair from his weak arms that ill might none betide him or her when food was brought to them her share to his averted lips the child did bear 1985 but when she saw he had enough she ate and wept the while the lonely man's despair hunger then overcame and of his state forgetful on the dust as in a trance he sate <\s>
<s> slowly the silence of the multitudes 1990 passed as when far is heard in some lone dell the gathering of a wind among the woods and he is fallen <\s>
<s> they cry he who did dwell like famine or the plague or aught more fell among our homes is fallen <\s>
<s> the murderer 1995 who slaked his thirsting soul as from a well of blood and tears with ruin <\s>
<s> sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear <\s>
<s> then was heard 'he who judged let him be brought to judgement <\s>
<s> blood for blood cries from the soil 2000 on which his crimes have deep pollution wrought <\s>
<s> shall othman only unavenged despoil <\s>
<s> shall they who by the stress of grinding toil wrest from the unwilling earth his luxuries perish for crime while his foul blood may boil 2005 or creep within his veins at will arise <\s>
<s> and to high justice make her chosen sacrifice <\s>
<s> what do ye seek <\s>
<s> what fear ye then i cried suddenly starting forth that ye should shed the blood of othman if your hearts are tried 2010 in the true love of freedom cease to dread this one poor lonely man beneath heaven spread in purest light above us all through earth maternal earth who doth her sweet smiles shed for all let him go free until the worth 2015 of human nature win from these a second birth <\s>
<s> what call ye justice <\s>
<s> is there one who ne'er in secret thought has wished another's ill are ye all pure <\s>
<s> let those stand forth who hear and tremble not <\s>
<s> shall they insult and kill 2020 if such they be <\s>
<s> their mild eyes can they fill with the false anger of the hypocrite <\s>
<s> alas such were not pure the chastened will of virtue sees that justice is the light of love and not revenge and terror and despite <\s>
<s> the murmur of the people slowly dying paused as i spake then those who near me were cast gentle looks where the lone man was lying shrouding his head which now that infant fair clasped on her lap in silence through the air 2030 sobs were then heard and many kissed my feet in pity's madness and to the despair of him whom late they cursed a solace sweet his very victims brought soft looks and speeches meet <\s>
<s> then to a home for his repose assigned 2035 accompanied by the still throng he went in silence where to soothe his rankling mind some likeness of his ancient state was lent and if his heart could have been innocent as those who pardoned him he might have ended 2040 his days in peace but his straight lips were bent men said into a smile which guile portended a sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended <\s>
<s> twas midnight now the eve of that great day whereon the many nations at whose call 2045 the chains of earth like mist melted away decreed to hold a sacred festival a rite to attest the equality of all who live <\s>
<s> so to their homes to dream or wake all went <\s>
