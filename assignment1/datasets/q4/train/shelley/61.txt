<s> summer was dead and autumn was expiring and infant winter laughed upon the land all cloudlessly and cold when i desiring more in this world than any understand wept o'er the beauty which like sea retiring 5 had left the earth bare as the wave worn sand of my lorn heart and o'er the grass and flowers pale for the falsehood of the flattering hours <\s>
<s> summer was dead but i yet lived to weep the instability of all but weeping 10 and on the earth lulled in her winter sleep i woke and envied her as she was sleeping <\s>
<s> over thy face shall creep the wakening vernal airs until thou leaping from unremembered dreams shalt ... <\s>
<s> see 15 no death divide thy immortality <\s>
<s> i loved oh no i mean not one of ye or any earthly one though ye are dear as human heart to human heart may be i loved i know not what but this low sphere 20 and all that it contains contains not thee thou whom seen nowhere i feel everywhere <\s>

<s> by heaven and earth from all whose shapes thou flowest 25 neither to be contained delayed nor hidden making divine the loftiest and the lowest when for a moment thou art not forbidden to live within the life which thou bestowest and leaving noblest things vacant and chidden 30 cold as a corpse after the spirit's flight blank as the sun after the birth of night <\s>
<s> in winds and trees and streams and all things common in music and the sweet unconscious tone of animals and voices which are human 35 meant to express some feelings of their own in the soft motions and rare smile of woman in flowers and leaves and in the grass fresh shown or dying in the autumn i the most adore thee present or lament thee lost <\s>
<s> and thus i went lamenting when i saw a plant upon the river's margin lie like one who loved beyond his nature's law and in despair had cast him down to die its leaves which had outlived the frost the thaw 45 had blighted like a heart which hatred's eye can blast not but which pity kills the dew lay on its spotted leaves like tears too true <\s>

<s> there are no pleasure boats on the arno and the shallowness of its waters except in winter time when the stream is too turbid and impetuous for boating rendered it difficult to get any skiff light enough to float <\s>

<s> they returned to pisa by the canal when missing the direct cut they got entangled among weeds and the boat upset a wetting was all the harm done except that the intense cold of his drenched clothes made shelley faint <\s>
<s> once i went down with him to the mouth of the arno where the stream then high and swift met the tideless sea and disturbed its sluggish waters <\s>
<s> it was a waste and dreary scene the desert sand stretched into a point surrounded by waves that broke idly though perpetually around it was a scene very similar to lido of which he had said i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows <\s>
<s> our little boat was of greater use unaccompanied by any danger when we removed to the baths <\s>

<s> it was a pleasant summer bright in all but shelley's health and inconstant spirits yet he enjoyed himself greatly and became more and more attached to the part of the country were chance appeared to cast us <\s>

<s> still shelley's passion was the ocean and he wished that our summers instead of being passed among the hills near pisa should be spent on the shores of the sea <\s>
<s> it was very difficult to find a spot <\s>

<s> the low lands and bad air of maremma stretch the whole length of the western shores of the mediterranean till broken by the rocks and hills of spezia <\s>

<s> summer was dead and autumn was expiring and infant winter laughed upon the land all cloudlessly and cold when i desiring more in this world than any understand wept o'er the beauty which like sea retiring 5 had left the earth bare as the wave worn sand of my lorn heart and o'er the grass and flowers pale for the falsehood of the flattering hours <\s>
<s> summer was dead but i yet lived to weep the instability of all but weeping 10 and on the earth lulled in her winter sleep i woke and envied her as she was sleeping <\s>
<s> over thy face shall creep the wakening vernal airs until thou leaping from unremembered dreams shalt ... <\s>
<s> see 15 no death divide thy immortality <\s>
<s> i loved oh no i mean not one of ye or any earthly one though ye are dear as human heart to human heart may be i loved i know not what but this low sphere 20 and all that it contains contains not thee thou whom seen nowhere i feel everywhere <\s>

<s> by heaven and earth from all whose shapes thou flowest 25 neither to be contained delayed nor hidden making divine the loftiest and the lowest when for a moment thou art not forbidden to live within the life which thou bestowest and leaving noblest things vacant and chidden 30 cold as a corpse after the spirit's flight blank as the sun after the birth of night <\s>
<s> in winds and trees and streams and all things common in music and the sweet unconscious tone of animals and voices which are human 35 meant to express some feelings of their own in the soft motions and rare smile of woman in flowers and leaves and in the grass fresh shown or dying in the autumn i the most adore thee present or lament thee lost <\s>
<s> and thus i went lamenting when i saw a plant upon the river's margin lie like one who loved beyond his nature's law and in despair had cast him down to die its leaves which had outlived the frost the thaw 45 had blighted like a heart which hatred's eye can blast not but which pity kills the dew lay on its spotted leaves like tears too true <\s>

<s> there are no pleasure boats on the arno and the shallowness of its waters except in winter time when the stream is too turbid and impetuous for boating rendered it difficult to get any skiff light enough to float <\s>

<s> they returned to pisa by the canal when missing the direct cut they got entangled among weeds and the boat upset a wetting was all the harm done except that the intense cold of his drenched clothes made shelley faint <\s>
<s> once i went down with him to the mouth of the arno where the stream then high and swift met the tideless sea and disturbed its sluggish waters <\s>
<s> it was a waste and dreary scene the desert sand stretched into a point surrounded by waves that broke idly though perpetually around it was a scene very similar to lido of which he had said i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows <\s>
<s> our little boat was of greater use unaccompanied by any danger when we removed to the baths <\s>

<s> it was a pleasant summer bright in all but shelley's health and inconstant spirits yet he enjoyed himself greatly and became more and more attached to the part of the country were chance appeared to cast us <\s>

<s> still shelley's passion was the ocean and he wished that our summers instead of being passed among the hills near pisa should be spent on the shores of the sea <\s>
<s> it was very difficult to find a spot <\s>

<s> the low lands and bad air of maremma stretch the whole length of the western shores of the mediterranean till broken by the rocks and hills of spezia <\s>
