<s> when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet 65 preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wanton such you may 70 hear among revellers on a holiday <\s>

<s> and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a self sufficing wight 105 like a man hastening on some distant way he from pieria's mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass <\s>

<s> and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled them and instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around 145 and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the fire such might was in the god <\s>
<s> and on the earth upon their backs he threw 150 the panting beasts and rolled them o'er and o'er and bored their lives out <\s>
<s> without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore 155 pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone <\s>
<s> we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyous minded hermes from the glen 160 drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are <\s>
<s> for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal <\s>
<s> natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet 170 down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all <\s>
<s> and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear 175 as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust 180 and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed <\s>
<s> all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountain peaks divine <\s>
<s> on his long wandering neither man nor god 185 had met him since he killed apollo's kine nor house dog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast <\s>
<s> right through the temple of the spacious cave 190 he went with soft light feet as if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddling clothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed 195 with his left hand about his knees the right held his beloved tortoise lyre tight <\s>
<s> there he lay innocent as a new born child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled 200 knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence <\s>
<s> what have you done since you departed hence <\s>
<s> apollo soon will pass within this gate and bind your tender body in a chain inextricably tight and fast as fate unless you can delude the god again even when within his arms ah runagate <\s>
<s> 210 a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made you dear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother <\s>
<s> as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what 215 and cared at all to hear my mother scold <\s>
<s> i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and me nor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food 220 to spend our lives in this obscure abode <\s>
<s> 29 but we will leave this shadow peopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey 225 and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will not natheless i who am the king of robbers can but try <\s>
<s> and if latona's son should find me out 230 i'll countermine him by a deeper plan i'll pierce the pythian temple walls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan 235 all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talked meanwhile the day 31 <\s>
<s> aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men <\s>
<s> apollo passed toward the sacred wood 240 which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptune and there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vine dresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there <\s>
<s> latona's glorious son began i pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns <\s>
<s> for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria 250 where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men <\s>
<s> and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one 255 but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows 260 to whom the man of overhanging brows 34 <\s>
<s> my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyard and to me 265 tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day 35 <\s>
<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>
<s> here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaur sand was never stirred 290 by man or woman thus <\s>
<s> who with unwearied feet could e'er impress the sand with such enormous vestiges <\s>
<s> that was most strange but this is stranger still <\s>
<s> thus having said phoebus impetuously 295 sought high cyllene's forest cinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnian's love child mercury and a delightful odour from the dew 300 of the hill pastures at his coming flew <\s>
<s> and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavern maia's child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled 305 and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddling clothes he piled as among fire brands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark <\s>
<s> there like an infant who had sucked his fill 310 and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulder blade <\s>

<s> round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took 320 the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rock where many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled within a wonder to behold <\s>

<s> or a quarrel between us must rise and the event will be that i 335 shall hurl you into dismal tartarus in fiery gloom to dwell eternally nor shall your father nor your mother loose the bars of that black dungeon utterly you shall be cast out from the light of day 340 to rule the ghosts of men unblessed as they <\s>

<s> thus having spoken the quaint infant bore 45 lifting it from the grass on which it fed and grasping it in his delighted hold his treasured prize into the cavern old <\s>

<s> when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet 65 preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wanton such you may 70 hear among revellers on a holiday <\s>

<s> seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat 80 he in his sacred crib deposited the hollow lyre and from the cavern sweet rushed with great leaps up to the mountain's head revolving in his mind some subtle feat of thievish craft such as a swindler might 85 devise in the lone season of dun night <\s>
<s> the great sun under the ocean's bed has driven steeds and chariot the child meanwhile strode o'er the pierian mountains clothed in shadows where the immortal oxen of the god 90 are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows and safely stalled in a remote abode the archer argicide elate and proud drove fifty from the herd lowing aloud <\s>
<s> he drove them wandering o'er the sandy way 95 but being ever mindful of his craft backward and forward drove he them astray so that the tracks which seemed before were aft his sandals then he threw to the ocean spray and for each foot he wrought a kind of raft 100 of tamarisk and tamarisk like sprigs and bound them in a lump with withy twigs <\s>
<s> and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a self sufficing wight 105 like a man hastening on some distant way he from pieria's mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass <\s>

<s> and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled them and instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around 145 and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the fire such might was in the god <\s>
<s> and on the earth upon their backs he threw 150 the panting beasts and rolled them o'er and o'er and bored their lives out <\s>
<s> without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore 155 pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone <\s>
<s> we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyous minded hermes from the glen 160 drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are <\s>
<s> for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal <\s>
<s> natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet 170 down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all <\s>
<s> and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear 175 as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust 180 and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed <\s>
<s> all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountain peaks divine <\s>
<s> on his long wandering neither man nor god 185 had met him since he killed apollo's kine nor house dog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast <\s>
<s> right through the temple of the spacious cave 190 he went with soft light feet as if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddling clothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed 195 with his left hand about his knees the right held his beloved tortoise lyre tight <\s>
<s> there he lay innocent as a new born child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled 200 knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence <\s>
<s> what have you done since you departed hence <\s>

<s> 210 a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made you dear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother <\s>
<s> as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what 215 and cared at all to hear my mother scold <\s>
<s> i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and me nor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food 220 to spend our lives in this obscure abode <\s>
<s> 29 but we will leave this shadow peopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey 225 and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will not natheless i who am the king of robbers can but try <\s>
<s> and if latona's son should find me out 230 i'll countermine him by a deeper plan i'll pierce the pythian temple walls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan 235 all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talked meanwhile the day 31 <\s>
<s> aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men <\s>
<s> apollo passed toward the sacred wood 240 which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptune and there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vine dresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there <\s>
<s> latona's glorious son began i pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns <\s>
<s> for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria 250 where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men <\s>
<s> and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one 255 but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows 260 to whom the man of overhanging brows 34 <\s>
<s> my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyard and to me 265 tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day 35 <\s>
<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>
<s> here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaur sand was never stirred 290 by man or woman thus <\s>
<s> who with unwearied feet could e'er impress the sand with such enormous vestiges <\s>
<s> that was most strange but this is stranger still <\s>
<s> thus having said phoebus impetuously 295 sought high cyllene's forest cinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnian's love child mercury and a delightful odour from the dew 300 of the hill pastures at his coming flew <\s>
<s> and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavern maia's child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled 305 and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddling clothes he piled as among fire brands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark <\s>
<s> there like an infant who had sucked his fill 310 and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulder blade <\s>

<s> round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took 320 the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rock where many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled within a wonder to behold <\s>

<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>

<s> thus having spoken the quaint infant bore 45 lifting it from the grass on which it fed and grasping it in his delighted hold his treasured prize into the cavern old <\s>

<s> when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet 65 preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wanton such you may 70 hear among revellers on a holiday <\s>

<s> seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat 80 he in his sacred crib deposited the hollow lyre and from the cavern sweet rushed with great leaps up to the mountain's head revolving in his mind some subtle feat of thievish craft such as a swindler might 85 devise in the lone season of dun night <\s>
<s> the great sun under the ocean's bed has driven steeds and chariot the child meanwhile strode o'er the pierian mountains clothed in shadows where the immortal oxen of the god 90 are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows and safely stalled in a remote abode the archer argicide elate and proud drove fifty from the herd lowing aloud <\s>
<s> he drove them wandering o'er the sandy way 95 but being ever mindful of his craft backward and forward drove he them astray so that the tracks which seemed before were aft his sandals then he threw to the ocean spray and for each foot he wrought a kind of raft 100 of tamarisk and tamarisk like sprigs and bound them in a lump with withy twigs <\s>
<s> and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a self sufficing wight 105 like a man hastening on some distant way he from pieria's mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass <\s>

<s> and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled them and instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around 145 and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the fire such might was in the god <\s>
<s> and on the earth upon their backs he threw 150 the panting beasts and rolled them o'er and o'er and bored their lives out <\s>
<s> without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore 155 pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone <\s>
<s> we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyous minded hermes from the glen 160 drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are <\s>
<s> for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal <\s>
<s> natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet 170 down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all <\s>
<s> and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear 175 as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust 180 and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed <\s>
<s> all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountain peaks divine <\s>
<s> on his long wandering neither man nor god 185 had met him since he killed apollo's kine nor house dog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast <\s>
<s> right through the temple of the spacious cave 190 he went with soft light feet as if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddling clothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed 195 with his left hand about his knees the right held his beloved tortoise lyre tight <\s>
<s> there he lay innocent as a new born child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled 200 knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence <\s>
<s> what have you done since you departed hence <\s>

<s> 210 a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made you dear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother <\s>
<s> as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what 215 and cared at all to hear my mother scold <\s>
<s> i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and me nor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food 220 to spend our lives in this obscure abode <\s>
<s> 29 but we will leave this shadow peopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey 225 and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will not natheless i who am the king of robbers can but try <\s>
<s> and if latona's son should find me out 230 i'll countermine him by a deeper plan i'll pierce the pythian temple walls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan 235 all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talked meanwhile the day 31 <\s>
<s> aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men <\s>
<s> apollo passed toward the sacred wood 240 which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptune and there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vine dresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there <\s>
<s> latona's glorious son began i pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns <\s>
<s> for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria 250 where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men <\s>
<s> and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one 255 but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows 260 to whom the man of overhanging brows 34 <\s>
<s> my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyard and to me 265 tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day 35 <\s>
<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>
<s> here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaur sand was never stirred 290 by man or woman thus <\s>
<s> who with unwearied feet could e'er impress the sand with such enormous vestiges <\s>
<s> that was most strange but this is stranger still <\s>
<s> thus having said phoebus impetuously 295 sought high cyllene's forest cinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnian's love child mercury and a delightful odour from the dew 300 of the hill pastures at his coming flew <\s>
<s> and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavern maia's child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled 305 and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddling clothes he piled as among fire brands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark <\s>
<s> there like an infant who had sucked his fill 310 and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulder blade <\s>

<s> round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took 320 the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rock where many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled within a wonder to behold <\s>

<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>

<s> thus having spoken the quaint infant bore 45 lifting it from the grass on which it fed and grasping it in his delighted hold his treasured prize into the cavern old <\s>

<s> when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet 65 preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wanton such you may 70 hear among revellers on a holiday <\s>

<s> seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat 80 he in his sacred crib deposited the hollow lyre and from the cavern sweet rushed with great leaps up to the mountain's head revolving in his mind some subtle feat of thievish craft such as a swindler might 85 devise in the lone season of dun night <\s>
<s> the great sun under the ocean's bed has driven steeds and chariot the child meanwhile strode o'er the pierian mountains clothed in shadows where the immortal oxen of the god 90 are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows and safely stalled in a remote abode the archer argicide elate and proud drove fifty from the herd lowing aloud <\s>
<s> he drove them wandering o'er the sandy way 95 but being ever mindful of his craft backward and forward drove he them astray so that the tracks which seemed before were aft his sandals then he threw to the ocean spray and for each foot he wrought a kind of raft 100 of tamarisk and tamarisk like sprigs and bound them in a lump with withy twigs <\s>
<s> and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a self sufficing wight 105 like a man hastening on some distant way he from pieria's mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass <\s>

<s> and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled them and instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around 145 and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the fire such might was in the god <\s>
<s> and on the earth upon their backs he threw 150 the panting beasts and rolled them o'er and o'er and bored their lives out <\s>
<s> without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore 155 pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone <\s>
<s> we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyous minded hermes from the glen 160 drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are <\s>
<s> for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal <\s>
<s> natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet 170 down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all <\s>
<s> and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear 175 as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust 180 and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed <\s>
<s> all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountain peaks divine <\s>
<s> on his long wandering neither man nor god 185 had met him since he killed apollo's kine nor house dog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast <\s>
<s> right through the temple of the spacious cave 190 he went with soft light feet as if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddling clothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed 195 with his left hand about his knees the right held his beloved tortoise lyre tight <\s>
<s> there he lay innocent as a new born child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled 200 knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence <\s>
<s> what have you done since you departed hence <\s>

<s> 210 a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made you dear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother <\s>
<s> as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what 215 and cared at all to hear my mother scold <\s>
<s> i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and me nor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food 220 to spend our lives in this obscure abode <\s>
<s> 29 but we will leave this shadow peopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey 225 and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will not natheless i who am the king of robbers can but try <\s>
<s> and if latona's son should find me out 230 i'll countermine him by a deeper plan i'll pierce the pythian temple walls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan 235 all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talked meanwhile the day 31 <\s>
<s> aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men <\s>
<s> apollo passed toward the sacred wood 240 which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptune and there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vine dresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there <\s>
<s> latona's glorious son began i pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns <\s>
<s> for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria 250 where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men <\s>
<s> and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one 255 but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows 260 to whom the man of overhanging brows 34 <\s>
<s> my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyard and to me 265 tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day 35 <\s>
<s> and then i thought i saw but dare not speak 270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fair horned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering 275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod <\s>
<s> apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his father's son <\s>
<s> 280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried 'what wonder do mine eyes behold <\s>
<s> here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaur sand was never stirred 290 by man or woman thus <\s>
<s> who with unwearied feet could e'er impress the sand with such enormous vestiges <\s>
<s> that was most strange but this is stranger still <\s>
<s> thus having said phoebus impetuously 295 sought high cyllene's forest cinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnian's love child mercury and a delightful odour from the dew 300 of the hill pastures at his coming flew <\s>
<s> and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavern maia's child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled 305 and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddling clothes he piled as among fire brands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark <\s>
<s> there like an infant who had sucked his fill 310 and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulder blade <\s>

<s> round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took 320 the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rock where many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled within a wonder to behold <\s>

<s> an ox stealer should be both tall and strong 350 and i am but a little new born thing who yet at least can think of nothing wrong my business is to suck and sleep and fling the cradle clothes about me all day long or half asleep hear my sweet mother sing 355 and to be washed in water clean and warm and hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm <\s>
<s> o let not e'er this quarrel be averred <\s>
