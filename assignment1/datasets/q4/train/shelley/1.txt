<s> except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation for the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched as proceeding not from the printer's carelessness but the author's <\s>
<s> the second class poems printed during shelley's lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant <\s>
<s> the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory <\s>
<s> shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published <\s>
<s> this also was probably not without influence on his determination to have the cenci and adonais printed in italy ... of the third class of shelley's writings those which were first published after his death sufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawny's graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggerated ... the difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering <\s>
<s> the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes <\s>
<s> some few of the manuscripts indeed such as those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out for the press in shelley's best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances <\s>
<s> an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such sense destroying errors as least for lead <\s>
<s> the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable <\s>
<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>

<s> shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published <\s>

<s> the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable <\s>
<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>

<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>

<s> richard garnett c b to the columns of the speaker of december 19 1903 from the textual point of view shelley's works may be divided into three classes those published in his lifetime under his own direction those also published in his lifetime but in his absence from the press and those published after his death <\s>

<s> except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation for the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched as proceeding not from the printer's carelessness but the author's <\s>
<s> the second class poems printed during shelley's lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant <\s>
<s> the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory <\s>
<s> shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published <\s>
<s> this also was probably not without influence on his determination to have the cenci and adonais printed in italy ... of the third class of shelley's writings those which were first published after his death sufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawny's graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggerated ... the difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering <\s>
<s> the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes <\s>
<s> some few of the manuscripts indeed such as those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out for the press in shelley's best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances <\s>
<s> an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such sense destroying errors as least for lead <\s>
<s> the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable <\s>
<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>
<s> if shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts <\s>

<s> after sir percy shelley's death lady shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to shelley at university college oxford to present certain of the manuscripts to the bodleian library and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the university where his residence was so brief and troubled <\s>

<s> for this reason the original pointing has been retained save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poet's meaning <\s>
<s> amongst the editor's notes at the end of the volume 3 the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identified and the original points which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others ascertained in the order of their occurrence <\s>

<s> shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published <\s>

<s> the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable <\s>
<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>

<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>

<s> richard garnett c b to the columns of the speaker of december 19 1903 from the textual point of view shelley's works may be divided into three classes those published in his lifetime under his own direction those also published in his lifetime but in his absence from the press and those published after his death <\s>

<s> except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation for the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched as proceeding not from the printer's carelessness but the author's <\s>
<s> the second class poems printed during shelley's lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant <\s>
<s> the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory <\s>
<s> shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published <\s>
<s> this also was probably not without influence on his determination to have the cenci and adonais printed in italy ... of the third class of shelley's writings those which were first published after his death sufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawny's graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggerated ... the difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering <\s>
<s> the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes <\s>
<s> some few of the manuscripts indeed such as those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out for the press in shelley's best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances <\s>
<s> an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such sense destroying errors as least for lead <\s>
<s> the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable <\s>
<s> it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available <\s>
<s> if shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts <\s>

<s> after sir percy shelley's death lady shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to shelley at university college oxford to present certain of the manuscripts to the bodleian library and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the university where his residence was so brief and troubled <\s>

<s> for this reason the original pointing has been retained save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poet's meaning <\s>
<s> amongst the editor's notes at the end of the volume 3 the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identified and the original points which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others ascertained in the order of their occurrence <\s>
