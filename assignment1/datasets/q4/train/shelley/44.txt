<s> i arose and for a space 335 the scene of woods and waters seemed to keep though it was now broad day a gentle trace of light diviner than the common sun sheds on the common earth and all the place was filled with magic sounds woven into one 340 oblivious melody confusing sense amid the gliding waves and shadows dun and as i looked the bright omnipresence of morning through the orient cavern flowed and the sun's image radiantly intense 345 burned on the waters of the well that glowed like gold and threaded all the forest's maze with winding paths of emerald fire there stood amid the sun as he amid the blaze 350 of his own glory on the vibrating floor of the fountain paved with flashing rays a shape all light which with one hand did fling dew on the earth as if she were the dawn and the invisible rain did ever sing a silver music on the mossy lawn 355 and still before me on the dusky grass iris her many coloured scarf had drawn in her right hand she bore a crystal glass mantling with bright nepenthe the fierce splendour fell from her as she moved under the mass 360 of the deep cavern and with palms so tender their tread broke not the mirror of its billow glided along the river and did bend her head under the dark boughs till like a willow her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream 365 that whispered with delight to be its pillow <\s>

<s> i arose and for a space 335 the scene of woods and waters seemed to keep though it was now broad day a gentle trace of light diviner than the common sun sheds on the common earth and all the place was filled with magic sounds woven into one 340 oblivious melody confusing sense amid the gliding waves and shadows dun and as i looked the bright omnipresence of morning through the orient cavern flowed and the sun's image radiantly intense 345 burned on the waters of the well that glowed like gold and threaded all the forest's maze with winding paths of emerald fire there stood amid the sun as he amid the blaze 350 of his own glory on the vibrating floor of the fountain paved with flashing rays a shape all light which with one hand did fling dew on the earth as if she were the dawn and the invisible rain did ever sing a silver music on the mossy lawn 355 and still before me on the dusky grass iris her many coloured scarf had drawn in her right hand she bore a crystal glass mantling with bright nepenthe the fierce splendour fell from her as she moved under the mass 360 of the deep cavern and with palms so tender their tread broke not the mirror of its billow glided along the river and did bend her head under the dark boughs till like a willow her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream 365 that whispered with delight to be its pillow <\s>

<s> i arose and for a space 335 the scene of woods and waters seemed to keep though it was now broad day a gentle trace of light diviner than the common sun sheds on the common earth and all the place was filled with magic sounds woven into one 340 oblivious melody confusing sense amid the gliding waves and shadows dun and as i looked the bright omnipresence of morning through the orient cavern flowed and the sun's image radiantly intense 345 burned on the waters of the well that glowed like gold and threaded all the forest's maze with winding paths of emerald fire there stood amid the sun as he amid the blaze 350 of his own glory on the vibrating floor of the fountain paved with flashing rays a shape all light which with one hand did fling dew on the earth as if she were the dawn and the invisible rain did ever sing a silver music on the mossy lawn 355 and still before me on the dusky grass iris her many coloured scarf had drawn in her right hand she bore a crystal glass mantling with bright nepenthe the fierce splendour fell from her as she moved under the mass 360 of the deep cavern and with palms so tender their tread broke not the mirror of its billow glided along the river and did bend her head under the dark boughs till like a willow her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream 365 that whispered with delight to be its pillow <\s>

<s> i arose and for a space 335 the scene of woods and waters seemed to keep though it was now broad day a gentle trace of light diviner than the common sun sheds on the common earth and all the place was filled with magic sounds woven into one 340 oblivious melody confusing sense amid the gliding waves and shadows dun and as i looked the bright omnipresence of morning through the orient cavern flowed and the sun's image radiantly intense 345 burned on the waters of the well that glowed like gold and threaded all the forest's maze with winding paths of emerald fire there stood amid the sun as he amid the blaze 350 of his own glory on the vibrating floor of the fountain paved with flashing rays a shape all light which with one hand did fling dew on the earth as if she were the dawn and the invisible rain did ever sing a silver music on the mossy lawn 355 and still before me on the dusky grass iris her many coloured scarf had drawn in her right hand she bore a crystal glass mantling with bright nepenthe the fierce splendour fell from her as she moved under the mass 360 of the deep cavern and with palms so tender their tread broke not the mirror of its billow glided along the river and did bend her head under the dark boughs till like a willow her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream 365 that whispered with delight to be its pillow <\s>
