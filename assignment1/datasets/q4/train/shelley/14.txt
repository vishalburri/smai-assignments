<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>

<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>
<s> ay if we were not weak and we aspire how vainly to be strong <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>

<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>

<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>

<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>

<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>

<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>

<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>

<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>

<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>

<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
<s> you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet <\s>
<s> but rosalind could bear no more and wept 1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep <\s>
<s> so rosalind and helen lived together 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when o'er the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain <\s>
<s> and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind 1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came <\s>
<s> and helen's boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw 1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them <\s>
<s> and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains 1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavenna's precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun 1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helen's home whose sad inhabitants each year would come 1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the clime's despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom 1310 of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb <\s>
<s> helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old <\s>

<s> rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed <\s>
<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth <\s>
<s> when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic <\s>
<s> he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion <\s>
<s> when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth <\s>
<s> in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake <\s>
<s> by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature <\s>
<s> rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca <\s>

<s> the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgil's gallus <\s>
<s> count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city <\s>
<s> he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country <\s>
<s> but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life <\s>
<s> his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength <\s>
<s> his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion <\s>
<s> i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo <\s>
<s> he is cheerful frank and witty <\s>
<s> his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell <\s>
<s> he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries <\s>
<s> julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible <\s>
<s> without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior <\s>
<s> he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion <\s>
<s> what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known <\s>
<s> julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities <\s>
<s> how far this is possible the pious reader will determine <\s>
<s> julian is rather serious <\s>
<s> of the maniac i can give no information <\s>
<s> he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love <\s>
<s> he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses <\s>
<s> his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart <\s>
<s> i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from ever shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 5 such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down <\s>
<s> this ride was my delight <\s>
<s> i love all waste and solitary places where we taste 15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love 20 to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth 25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment <\s>
<s> so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame <\s>
<s> this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also <\s>
<s> 35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side <\s>
<s> the sense that he was greater than his kind 50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light <\s>
<s> meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow 55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy <\s>
<s> thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then 60 just where we had dismounted the count's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood 65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heaven sustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky 70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75 among the many folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been 80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent <\s>
<s> ere it fade 85 said my companion i will show you soon a better station' so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening's gleam 90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven <\s>
<s> i was about to speak when 'we are even now at the point i meant said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row <\s>
<s> 95 look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell <\s>
<s> i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile 100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 105 in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 110 to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied <\s>
<s> you talk as in years past said maddalo <\s>
<s> tis strange men change not <\s>
<s> you were ever still 115 among christ's flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambs if you can't swim beware of providence <\s>
<s> i looked on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye <\s>
<s> and such he cried is our mortality 120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven illumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125 round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what <\s>
<s> they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled <\s>
<s> i recall 130 the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions <\s>
<s> the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower looked gray and all between 135 the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloom into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently <\s>
<s> we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way <\s>
<s> 140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being 145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me 150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so 155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered <\s>
<s> salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be 160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke 165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night <\s>
<s> it is our will 170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical <\s>
<s> where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind <\s>
<s> and if we were not weak 175 should we be less in deed than in desire <\s>
<s> ay if we were not weak and we aspire how vainly to be strong <\s>
<s> said maddalo you talk utopia <\s>
<s> it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find 180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us <\s>
<s> we know that we have power over ourselves to do 185 and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind 190 yet feel their faith religion <\s>
<s> my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation tight as far as words go <\s>
<s> i knew one like you 195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow <\s>
<s> but if you would like to go we'll visit him and his wild talk will show 200 how vain are such aspiring theories <\s>
<s> i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed 205 his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death <\s>
<s> this is not destiny 210 but man's own wilful ill <\s>
<s> as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fast falling rain and high wrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands <\s>
<s> the clap of tortured hands 215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us <\s>
<s> we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard <\s>
<s> i heard on high 220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds <\s>
<s> then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus move ... but what is he 230 whom we seek here <\s>
<s> of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you 240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow <\s>
<s> but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad <\s>
