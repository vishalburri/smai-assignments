<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>
<s> he did not hesitate to resolve if such were menaced to abandon country fortune everything and to escape with his child and i find some unfinished stanzas addressed to this son whom afterwards we lost at rome written under the idea that we might suddenly be forced to cross the sea so to preserve him <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>
<s> he did not hesitate to resolve if such were menaced to abandon country fortune everything and to escape with his child and i find some unfinished stanzas addressed to this son whom afterwards we lost at rome written under the idea that we might suddenly be forced to cross the sea so to preserve him <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>

<s> the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart <\s>
<s> the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse <\s>
<s> much was composed during this year <\s>
<s> the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effort rosalind and helen was begun and the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours <\s>
<s> in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence <\s>
<s> as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelley's mind and desire to trace its workings <\s>
<s> he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems <\s>
<s> his readings this year were chiefly greek <\s>
<s> besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrian's historia indica <\s>
<s> in latin apuleius alone is named <\s>
<s> in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening <\s>
<s> among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron <\s>
<s> his life was now spent more in thought than action he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind <\s>
<s> and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man <\s>
<s> he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation <\s>
<s> he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others not in bitterness but in sport <\s>
<s> the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop <\s>
<s> he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society <\s>
<s> these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain <\s>
<s> there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness or repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southey's old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life <\s>
<s> no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him <\s>
<s> in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a father's love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences <\s>
<s> at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us <\s>
