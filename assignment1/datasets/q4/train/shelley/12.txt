<s> the long array of guards in golden arms and priests beside 4460 singing their bloody hymns whose garbs betray the blackness of the faith it seems to hide and see the tyrant's gem wrought chariot glide among the gloomy cowls and glittering spears a shape of light is sitting by his side 4465 a child most beautiful <\s>

<s> tumult was in the soul of all beside ill joy or doubt or fear but those who saw their tranquil victim pass felt wonder glide into their brain and became calm with awe 4480 see the slow pageant near the pile doth draw <\s>
<s> a thousand torches in the spacious square borne by the ready slaves of ruthless law await the signal round the morning fair is changed to a dim night by that unnatural glare <\s>
<s> beneath a sun bright canopy upon a platform level with the pile the anxious tyrant sit enthroned on high girt by the chieftains of the host all smile in expectation but one child the while 4490 i laon led by mutes ascend my bier of fire and look around each distant isle is dark in the bright dawn towers far and near pierce like reposing flames the tremulous atmosphere <\s>
<s> there was such silence through the host as when 4495 an earthquake trampling on some populous town has crushed ten thousand with one tread and men expect the second all were mute but one that fairest child who bold with love alone stood up before the king without avail 4500 pleading for laon's life her stifled groan was heard she trembled like one aspen pale among the gloomy pines of a norwegian vale <\s>
<s> what were his thoughts linked in the morning sun among those reptiles stingless with delay 4505 even like a tyrant's wrath the signal gun roared hark again <\s>
<s> in that dread pause he lay as in a quiet dream the slaves obey a thousand torches drop and hark the last bursts on that awful silence far away 4510 millions with hearts that beat both loud and fast watch for the springing flame expectant and aghast <\s>
<s> they fly the torches fall a cry of fear has startled the triumphant they recede <\s>
<s> for ere the cannon's roar has died they hear 4515 the tramp of hoofs like earthquake and a steed dark and gigantic with the tempest's speed bursts through their ranks a woman sits thereon fairer it seems than aught that earth can breed calm radiant like the phantom of the dawn 4520 a spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone <\s>
<s> all thought it was god's angel come to sweep the lingering guilty to their fiery grave the tyrant from his throne in dread did leap her innocence his child from fear did save 4525 scared by the faith they feigned each priestly slave knelt for his mercy whom they served with blood and like the refluence of a mighty wave sucked into the loud sea the multitude with crushing panic fled in terror's altered mood <\s>
<s> they pause they blush they gaze a gathering shout bursts like one sound from the ten thousand streams of a tempestuous sea that sudden rout one checked who never in his mildest dreams felt awe from grace or loveliness the seams 4535 of his rent heart so hard and cold a creed had seared with blistering ice but he misdeems that he is wise whose wounds do only bleed inly for self thus thought the iberian priest indeed 11 <\s>
<s> and others too thought he was wise to see 4540 in pain and fear and hate something divine in love and beauty no divinity now with a bitter smile whose light did shine like a fiend's hope upon his lips and eyne he said and the persuasion of that sneer 4545 rallied his trembling comrades 'is it mine to stand alone when kings and soldiers fear a woman <\s>
<s> heaven has sent its other victim here <\s>
<s> were it not impious said the king to break our holy oath impious to keep it say <\s>
<s> 4550 shrieked the exulting priest slaves to the stake bind her and on my head the burden lay of her just torments at the judgement day will i stand up before the golden throne of heaven and cry to thee did i betray 4555 an infidel but for me she would have known another moment's joy <\s>
<s> the glory be thine own 13 <\s>
<s> they trembled but replied not nor obeyed pausing in breathless silence <\s>
<s> cythna sprung from her gigantic steed who like a shade 4560 chased by the winds those vacant streets among fled tameless as the brazen rein she flung upon his neck and kissed his mooned brow <\s>
<s> a piteous sight that one so fair and young the clasp of such a fearful death should woo 4565 with smiles of tender joy as beamed from cythna now <\s>
<s> the warm tears burst in spite of faith and fear from many a tremulous eye but like soft dews which feed spring's earliest buds hung gathered there frozen by doubt alas <\s>
<s> they could not choose 4570 but weep for when her faint limbs did refuse to climb the pyre upon the mutes she smiled and with her eloquent gestures and the hues of her quick lips even as a weary child wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild 4575 15 <\s>
<s> she won them though unwilling her to bind near me among the snakes <\s>
<s> when there had fled one soft reproach that was most thrilling kind she smiled on me and nothing then we said but each upon the other's countenance fed 4580 looks of insatiate love the mighty veil which doth divide the living and the dead was almost rent the world grew dim and pale all light in heaven or earth beside our love did fail 16 <\s>
<s> yet yet one brief relapse like the last beam 4585 of dying flames the stainless air around hung silent and serene a blood red gleam burst upwards hurling fiercely from the ground the globed smoke i heard the mighty sound of its uprise like a tempestuous ocean 4590 and through its chasms i saw as in a swound the tyrant's child fall without life or motion before his throne subdued by some unseen emotion 17 <\s>
<s> and is this death the pyre has disappeared the pestilence the tyrant and the throng 4595 the flames grow silent slowly there is heard the music of a breath suspending song which like the kiss of love when life is young steeps the faint eyes in darkness sweet and deep with ever changing notes it floats along 4600 till on my passive soul there seemed to creep a melody like waves on wrinkled sands that leap <\s>
<s> the warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand wakened me then lo <\s>
<s> cythna sate reclined beside me on the waved and golden sand 4605 of a clear pool upon a bank o'ertwined with strange and star bright flowers which to the wind breathed divine odour high above was spread the emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead 4610 a shadow which was light upon the waters shed <\s>
<s> and round about sloped many a lawny mountain with incense bearing forests and vast caves of marble radiance to that mighty fountain and where the flood its own bright margin laves 4615 their echoes talk with its eternal waves which from the depths whose jagged caverns breed their unreposing strife it lifts and heaves till through a chasm of hills they roll and feed a river deep which flies with smooth but arrowy speed <\s>
<s> as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder a boat approached borne by the musical air along the waves which sung and sparkled under its rapid keel a winged shape sate there a child with silver shining wings so fair 4625 that as her bark did through the waters glide the shadow of the lingering waves did wear light as from starry beams from side to side while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide <\s>
<s> the boat was one curved shell of hollow pearl 4630 almost translucent with the light divine of her within the prow and stern did curl horned on high like the young moon supine when o'er dim twilight mountains dark with pine it floats upon the sunset's sea of beams 4635 whose golden waves in many a purple line fade fast till borne on sunlight's ebbing streams dilating on earth's verge the sunken meteor gleams <\s>
<s> its keel has struck the sands beside our feet then cythna turned to me and from her eyes 4640 which swam with unshed tears a look more sweet than happy love a wild and glad surprise glanced as she spake ay this is paradise and not a dream and we are all united <\s>
<s> lo that is mine own child who in the guise 4645 of madness came like day to one benighted in lonesome woods my heart is now too well requited <\s>
<s> and then she wept aloud and in her arms clasped that bright shape less marvellously fair than her own human hues and living charms 4650 which as she leaned in passion's silence there breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air which seemed to blush and tremble with delight the glossy darkness of her streaming hair fell o'er that snowy child and wrapped from sight 4655 the fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite <\s>
<s> then the bright child the plumed seraph came and fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine and said i was disturbed by tremulous shame when once we met yet knew that i was thine 4660 from the same hour in which thy lips divine kindled a clinging dream within my brain which ever waked when i might sleep to twine thine image with her memory dear again we meet exempted now from mortal fear or pain <\s>
<s> when the consuming flames had wrapped ye round the hope which i had cherished went away i fell in agony on the senseless ground and hid mine eyes in dust and far astray my mind was gone when bright like dawning day 4670 the spectre of the plague before me flew and breathed upon my lips and seemed to say they wait for thee beloved then i knew the death mark on my breast and became calm anew <\s>
<s> it was the calm of love for i was dying <\s>
<s> 4675 i saw the black and half extinguished pyre in its own gray and shrunken ashes lying the pitchy smoke of the departed fire still hung in many a hollow dome and spire above the towers like night beneath whose shade 4680 awed by the ending of their own desire the armies stood a vacancy was made in expectation's depth and so they stood dismayed <\s>

<s> as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder a boat approached borne by the musical air along the waves which sung and sparkled under its rapid keel a winged shape sate there a child with silver shining wings so fair 4625 that as her bark did through the waters glide the shadow of the lingering waves did wear light as from starry beams from side to side while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide <\s>

<s> as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder a boat approached borne by the musical air along the waves which sung and sparkled under its rapid keel a winged shape sate there a child with silver shining wings so fair 4625 that as her bark did through the waters glide the shadow of the lingering waves did wear light as from starry beams from side to side while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide <\s>

<s> tumult was in the soul of all beside ill joy or doubt or fear but those who saw their tranquil victim pass felt wonder glide into their brain and became calm with awe 4480 see the slow pageant near the pile doth draw <\s>
<s> a thousand torches in the spacious square borne by the ready slaves of ruthless law await the signal round the morning fair is changed to a dim night by that unnatural glare <\s>
<s> beneath a sun bright canopy upon a platform level with the pile the anxious tyrant sit enthroned on high girt by the chieftains of the host all smile in expectation but one child the while 4490 i laon led by mutes ascend my bier of fire and look around each distant isle is dark in the bright dawn towers far and near pierce like reposing flames the tremulous atmosphere <\s>
<s> there was such silence through the host as when 4495 an earthquake trampling on some populous town has crushed ten thousand with one tread and men expect the second all were mute but one that fairest child who bold with love alone stood up before the king without avail 4500 pleading for laon's life her stifled groan was heard she trembled like one aspen pale among the gloomy pines of a norwegian vale <\s>
<s> what were his thoughts linked in the morning sun among those reptiles stingless with delay 4505 even like a tyrant's wrath the signal gun roared hark again <\s>
<s> in that dread pause he lay as in a quiet dream the slaves obey a thousand torches drop and hark the last bursts on that awful silence far away 4510 millions with hearts that beat both loud and fast watch for the springing flame expectant and aghast <\s>
<s> they fly the torches fall a cry of fear has startled the triumphant they recede <\s>
<s> for ere the cannon's roar has died they hear 4515 the tramp of hoofs like earthquake and a steed dark and gigantic with the tempest's speed bursts through their ranks a woman sits thereon fairer it seems than aught that earth can breed calm radiant like the phantom of the dawn 4520 a spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone <\s>
<s> all thought it was god's angel come to sweep the lingering guilty to their fiery grave the tyrant from his throne in dread did leap her innocence his child from fear did save 4525 scared by the faith they feigned each priestly slave knelt for his mercy whom they served with blood and like the refluence of a mighty wave sucked into the loud sea the multitude with crushing panic fled in terror's altered mood <\s>
<s> they pause they blush they gaze a gathering shout bursts like one sound from the ten thousand streams of a tempestuous sea that sudden rout one checked who never in his mildest dreams felt awe from grace or loveliness the seams 4535 of his rent heart so hard and cold a creed had seared with blistering ice but he misdeems that he is wise whose wounds do only bleed inly for self thus thought the iberian priest indeed 11 <\s>
<s> and others too thought he was wise to see 4540 in pain and fear and hate something divine in love and beauty no divinity now with a bitter smile whose light did shine like a fiend's hope upon his lips and eyne he said and the persuasion of that sneer 4545 rallied his trembling comrades 'is it mine to stand alone when kings and soldiers fear a woman <\s>
<s> heaven has sent its other victim here <\s>
<s> were it not impious said the king to break our holy oath impious to keep it say <\s>
<s> 4550 shrieked the exulting priest slaves to the stake bind her and on my head the burden lay of her just torments at the judgement day will i stand up before the golden throne of heaven and cry to thee did i betray 4555 an infidel but for me she would have known another moment's joy <\s>
<s> the glory be thine own 13 <\s>
<s> they trembled but replied not nor obeyed pausing in breathless silence <\s>
<s> cythna sprung from her gigantic steed who like a shade 4560 chased by the winds those vacant streets among fled tameless as the brazen rein she flung upon his neck and kissed his mooned brow <\s>
<s> a piteous sight that one so fair and young the clasp of such a fearful death should woo 4565 with smiles of tender joy as beamed from cythna now <\s>
<s> the warm tears burst in spite of faith and fear from many a tremulous eye but like soft dews which feed spring's earliest buds hung gathered there frozen by doubt alas <\s>
<s> they could not choose 4570 but weep for when her faint limbs did refuse to climb the pyre upon the mutes she smiled and with her eloquent gestures and the hues of her quick lips even as a weary child wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild 4575 15 <\s>
<s> she won them though unwilling her to bind near me among the snakes <\s>
<s> when there had fled one soft reproach that was most thrilling kind she smiled on me and nothing then we said but each upon the other's countenance fed 4580 looks of insatiate love the mighty veil which doth divide the living and the dead was almost rent the world grew dim and pale all light in heaven or earth beside our love did fail 16 <\s>
<s> yet yet one brief relapse like the last beam 4585 of dying flames the stainless air around hung silent and serene a blood red gleam burst upwards hurling fiercely from the ground the globed smoke i heard the mighty sound of its uprise like a tempestuous ocean 4590 and through its chasms i saw as in a swound the tyrant's child fall without life or motion before his throne subdued by some unseen emotion 17 <\s>
<s> and is this death the pyre has disappeared the pestilence the tyrant and the throng 4595 the flames grow silent slowly there is heard the music of a breath suspending song which like the kiss of love when life is young steeps the faint eyes in darkness sweet and deep with ever changing notes it floats along 4600 till on my passive soul there seemed to creep a melody like waves on wrinkled sands that leap <\s>
<s> the warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand wakened me then lo <\s>
<s> cythna sate reclined beside me on the waved and golden sand 4605 of a clear pool upon a bank o'ertwined with strange and star bright flowers which to the wind breathed divine odour high above was spread the emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead 4610 a shadow which was light upon the waters shed <\s>
<s> and round about sloped many a lawny mountain with incense bearing forests and vast caves of marble radiance to that mighty fountain and where the flood its own bright margin laves 4615 their echoes talk with its eternal waves which from the depths whose jagged caverns breed their unreposing strife it lifts and heaves till through a chasm of hills they roll and feed a river deep which flies with smooth but arrowy speed <\s>
<s> as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder a boat approached borne by the musical air along the waves which sung and sparkled under its rapid keel a winged shape sate there a child with silver shining wings so fair 4625 that as her bark did through the waters glide the shadow of the lingering waves did wear light as from starry beams from side to side while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide <\s>
<s> the boat was one curved shell of hollow pearl 4630 almost translucent with the light divine of her within the prow and stern did curl horned on high like the young moon supine when o'er dim twilight mountains dark with pine it floats upon the sunset's sea of beams 4635 whose golden waves in many a purple line fade fast till borne on sunlight's ebbing streams dilating on earth's verge the sunken meteor gleams <\s>
<s> its keel has struck the sands beside our feet then cythna turned to me and from her eyes 4640 which swam with unshed tears a look more sweet than happy love a wild and glad surprise glanced as she spake ay this is paradise and not a dream and we are all united <\s>
<s> lo that is mine own child who in the guise 4645 of madness came like day to one benighted in lonesome woods my heart is now too well requited <\s>
<s> and then she wept aloud and in her arms clasped that bright shape less marvellously fair than her own human hues and living charms 4650 which as she leaned in passion's silence there breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air which seemed to blush and tremble with delight the glossy darkness of her streaming hair fell o'er that snowy child and wrapped from sight 4655 the fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite <\s>
<s> then the bright child the plumed seraph came and fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine and said i was disturbed by tremulous shame when once we met yet knew that i was thine 4660 from the same hour in which thy lips divine kindled a clinging dream within my brain which ever waked when i might sleep to twine thine image with her memory dear again we meet exempted now from mortal fear or pain <\s>
<s> when the consuming flames had wrapped ye round the hope which i had cherished went away i fell in agony on the senseless ground and hid mine eyes in dust and far astray my mind was gone when bright like dawning day 4670 the spectre of the plague before me flew and breathed upon my lips and seemed to say they wait for thee beloved then i knew the death mark on my breast and became calm anew <\s>
<s> it was the calm of love for i was dying <\s>
<s> 4675 i saw the black and half extinguished pyre in its own gray and shrunken ashes lying the pitchy smoke of the departed fire still hung in many a hollow dome and spire above the towers like night beneath whose shade 4680 awed by the ending of their own desire the armies stood a vacancy was made in expectation's depth and so they stood dismayed <\s>
