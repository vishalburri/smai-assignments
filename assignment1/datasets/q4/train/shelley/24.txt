<s> camillo there is an obsolete and doubtful law by which you might obtain a bare provision of food and clothing giacomo nothing more <\s>
<s> bare must be the provision which strict law awards and aged sullen avarice pays <\s>
<s> 5 why did my father not apprentice me to some mechanic trade <\s>
<s> i should have then been trained in no highborn necessities which i could meet not by my daily toil <\s>
<s> the eldest son of a rich nobleman 10 is heir to all his incapacities he has wide wants and narrow powers <\s>
<s> if you cardinal camillo were reduced at once from thrice driven beds of down and delicate food an hundred servants and six palaces 15 to that which nature doth indeed require camillo nay there is reason in your plea twere hard <\s>
<s> giacomo tis hard for a firm man to bear but i have a dear wife a lady of high birth whose dowry in ill hour i lent my father 20 without a bond or witness to the deed and children who inherit her fine senses the fairest creatures in this breathing world and she and they reproach me not <\s>
<s> cardinal do you not think the pope would interpose 25 and stretch authority beyond the law <\s>
<s> camillo though your peculiar case is hard i know the pope will not divert the course of law <\s>
<s> after that impious feast the other night i spoke with him and urged him then to check 30 your father's cruel hand he frowned and said children are disobedient and they sting their fathers hearts to madness and despair requiting years of care with contumely <\s>
<s> i pity the count cenci from my heart 35 his outraged love perhaps awakened hate and thus he is exasperated to ill <\s>
<s> in the great war between the old and young i who have white hairs and a tottering body will keep at least blameless neutrality <\s>

<s> giacomo alas repeat them not again <\s>
<s> there then is no redress for me at least none but that which i may achieve myself since i am driven to the brink but say 45 my innocent sister and my only brother are dying underneath my father's eye <\s>

<s> i pray you now excuse me <\s>
<s> i have business that will not bear delay <\s>
<s> exit camillo giacomo but you orsino have the petition wherefore not present it <\s>
<s> orsino i have presented it and backed it with 60 my earnest prayers and urgent interest it was returned unanswered <\s>
<s> i doubt not but that the strange and execrable deeds alleged in it in truth they might well baffle any belief have turned the pope's displeasure 65 upon the accusers from the criminal so i should guess from what camillo said <\s>
<s> giacomo my friend that palace walking devil gold has whispered silence to his holiness and we are left as scorpions ringed with fire <\s>

<s> for he who is our murderous persecutor is shielded by a father's holy name or i would stops abruptly orsino what <\s>
<s> fear not to speak your thought <\s>

<s> giacomo ask me not what i think the unwilling brain feigns often what it would not and we trust imagination with such fantasies as the tongue dares not fashion into words 85 which have no words their horror makes them dim to the mind's eye my heart denies itself to think what you demand <\s>
<s> orsino but a friend's bosom is as the inmost cave of our own mind where we sit shut from the wide gaze of day 90 and from the all communicating air <\s>
<s> you look what i suspected giacomo spare me now <\s>

<s> of all earthly things i fear a man whose blows outspeed his words 125 and such is cenci and while cenci lives his daughter's dowry were a secret grave if a priest wins her oh fair beatrice <\s>
