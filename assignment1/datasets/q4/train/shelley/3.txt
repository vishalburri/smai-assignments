<s> to see him was to love him and his presence like ithuriel's spear was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world <\s>
<s> his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection <\s>
<s> he was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician without possessing much scientific knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its name and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion <\s>
<s> he made his study and reading room of the shadowed copse the stream the lake and the waterfall <\s>
<s> ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our first arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beautiful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree <\s>
<s> such was his love for nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited <\s>
<s> in early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and ireland <\s>

<s> in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates <\s>
<s> his days were chiefly spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation <\s>
<s> at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions <\s>
<s> the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends our entire sequestration from the rest of the world all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment <\s>
<s> i am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known his health even rapidly improved and he was never better than when i last saw him full of spirits and joy embark for leghorn that he might there welcome leigh hunt to italy <\s>

<s> his vessel bore out of sight with a favourable wind and i remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea which was about to engulf him <\s>

<s> he then embarked with mr <\s>
<s> williams the chosen and beloved sharer of his pleasures and of his fate to return to us <\s>
<s> we waited for them in vain the sea by its restless moaning seemed to desire to inform us of what we would not learn but a veil may well be drawn over such misery <\s>
<s> the real anguish of those moments transcended all the fictions that the most glowing imagination ever portrayed our seclusion the savage nature of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages and our immediate vicinity to the troubled sea combined to imbue with strange horror our days of uncertainty <\s>
<s> the truth was at last known a truth that made our loved and lovely italy appear a tomb its sky a pall <\s>

<s> his absence from this country which prevented our mutual explanation has unfortunately rendered my scheme abortive <\s>
<s> i do not doubt but that on some other occasion he will pay this tribute to his lost friend and sincerely regret that the volume which i edit has not been honoured by its insertion <\s>
<s> the comparative solitude in which mr <\s>
<s> shelley lived was the occasion that he was personally known to few and his fearless enthusiasm in the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth the improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind was the chief reason why he like other illustrious reformers was pursued by hatred and calumny <\s>

<s> before the critics contradict me let them appeal to any one who had ever known him <\s>
<s> to see him was to love him and his presence like ithuriel's spear was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world <\s>
<s> his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection <\s>
<s> he was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician without possessing much scientific knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its name and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion <\s>
<s> he made his study and reading room of the shadowed copse the stream the lake and the waterfall <\s>
<s> ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our first arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beautiful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree <\s>
<s> such was his love for nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited <\s>

<s> in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates <\s>
<s> his days were chiefly spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation <\s>
<s> at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions <\s>
<s> the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends our entire sequestration from the rest of the world all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment <\s>
<s> i am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known his health even rapidly improved and he was never better than when i last saw him full of spirits and joy embark for leghorn that he might there welcome leigh hunt to italy <\s>

<s> his vessel bore out of sight with a favourable wind and i remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea which was about to engulf him <\s>

<s> how wonderful is death death and his brother sleep <\s>
<s> one pale as yonder wan and horned moon with lips of lurid blue the other glowing like the vital morn 5 when throned on ocean's wave it breathes over the world yet both so passing strange and wonderful <\s>
<s> hath then the iron sceptred skeleton whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres 10 to the hell dogs that couch beneath his throne cast that fair prey <\s>
<s> must that divinest form which love and admiration cannot view without a beating heart whose azure veins steal like dark streams along a field of snow 15 whose outline is as fair as marble clothed in light of some sublimest mind decay <\s>
<s> nor putrefaction's breath leave aught of this pure spectacle but loathsomeness and ruin 20 spare aught but a dark theme on which the lightest heart might moralize <\s>
<s> or is it but that downy winged slumbers have charmed their nurse coy silence near her lids to watch their own repose <\s>
<s> 25 will they when morning's beam flows through those wells of light seek far from noise and day some western cave where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds a lulling murmur weave 30 ianthe doth not sleep the dreamless sleep of death nor in her moonlight chamber silently doth henry hear her regular pulses throb or mark her delicate cheek 35 with interchange of hues mock the broad moon outwatching weary night without assured reward <\s>
<s> her dewy eyes are closed on their translucent lids whose texture fine 40 scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below with unapparent fire the baby sleep is pillowed her golden tresses shade the bosom's stainless pride 45 twining like tendrils of the parasite around a marble column <\s>
<s> whence that rushing sound <\s>
<s> tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps around a lonely ruin 50 when west winds sigh and evening waves respond in whispers from the shore tis wilder than the unmeasured notes which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves the genii of the breezes sweep <\s>
<s> 55 floating on waves of music and of light the chariot of the daemon of the world descends in silent power its shape reposed within slight as some cloud that catches but the palest tinge of day 60 when evening yields to night bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue its transitory robe <\s>
<s> four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful draw that strange car of glory reins of light 65 check their unearthly speed they stop and fold their wings of braided air the daemon leaning from the ethereal car gazed on the slumbering maid <\s>
<s> human eye hath ne'er beheld 70 a shape so wild so bright so beautiful as that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep waving a starry wand hung like a mist of light <\s>
<s> such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds 75 of wakening spring arose filling the chamber and the moonlight sky <\s>
<s> maiden the world's supremest spirit beneath the shadow of her wings folds all thy memory doth inherit 80 from ruin of divinest things feelings that lure thee to betray and light of thoughts that pass away <\s>
<s> for thou hast earned a mighty boon the truths which wisest poets see 85 dimly thy mind may make its own rewarding its own majesty entranced in some diviner mood of self oblivious solitude <\s>

<s> to see him was to love him and his presence like ithuriel's spear was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world <\s>
<s> his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection <\s>
<s> he was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician without possessing much scientific knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its name and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion <\s>
<s> he made his study and reading room of the shadowed copse the stream the lake and the waterfall <\s>
<s> ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our first arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beautiful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree <\s>
<s> such was his love for nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited <\s>
<s> in early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and ireland <\s>
<s> afterwards the alps of switzerland became his inspirers <\s>
<s> prometheus unbound was written among the deserted and flower grown ruins of rome and when he made his home under the pisan hills their roofless recesses harboured him as he composed the witch of atlas adonais and hellas <\s>
<s> in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates <\s>
<s> his days were chiefly spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation <\s>
<s> at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions <\s>
<s> the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends our entire sequestration from the rest of the world all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment <\s>
<s> i am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known his health even rapidly improved and he was never better than when i last saw him full of spirits and joy embark for leghorn that he might there welcome leigh hunt to italy <\s>
<s> i was to have accompanied him but illness confined me to my room and thus put the seal on my misfortune <\s>
<s> his vessel bore out of sight with a favourable wind and i remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea which was about to engulf him <\s>

<s> he then embarked with mr <\s>
<s> williams the chosen and beloved sharer of his pleasures and of his fate to return to us <\s>
<s> we waited for them in vain the sea by its restless moaning seemed to desire to inform us of what we would not learn but a veil may well be drawn over such misery <\s>
<s> the real anguish of those moments transcended all the fictions that the most glowing imagination ever portrayed our seclusion the savage nature of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages and our immediate vicinity to the troubled sea combined to imbue with strange horror our days of uncertainty <\s>
<s> the truth was at last known a truth that made our loved and lovely italy appear a tomb its sky a pall <\s>
<s> every heart echoed the deep lament and my only consolation was in the praise and earnest love that each voice bestowed and each countenance demonstrated for him we had lost not i fondly hope for ever his unearthly and elevated nature is a pledge of the continuation of his being although in an altered form <\s>

<s> i must add a few words concerning the contents of this volume <\s>
<s> julian and maddalo the witch of atlas and most of the translations were written some years ago and with the exception of the cyclops and the scenes from the magico prodigioso may be considered as having received the author's ultimate corrections <\s>
<s> the triumph of life was his last work and was left in so unfinished a state that i arranged it in its present form with great difficulty <\s>
<s> all his poems which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume and i have added a reprint of alastor or the spirit of solitude the difficulty with which a copy can be obtained is the cause of its republication <\s>

<s> one pale as yonder wan and horned moon with lips of lurid blue the other glowing like the vital morn 5 when throned on ocean's wave it breathes over the world yet both so passing strange and wonderful <\s>
<s> hath then the iron sceptred skeleton whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres 10 to the hell dogs that couch beneath his throne cast that fair prey <\s>
<s> must that divinest form which love and admiration cannot view without a beating heart whose azure veins steal like dark streams along a field of snow 15 whose outline is as fair as marble clothed in light of some sublimest mind decay <\s>
<s> nor putrefaction's breath leave aught of this pure spectacle but loathsomeness and ruin 20 spare aught but a dark theme on which the lightest heart might moralize <\s>
<s> or is it but that downy winged slumbers have charmed their nurse coy silence near her lids to watch their own repose <\s>
<s> 25 will they when morning's beam flows through those wells of light seek far from noise and day some western cave where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds a lulling murmur weave 30 ianthe doth not sleep the dreamless sleep of death nor in her moonlight chamber silently doth henry hear her regular pulses throb or mark her delicate cheek 35 with interchange of hues mock the broad moon outwatching weary night without assured reward <\s>
<s> her dewy eyes are closed on their translucent lids whose texture fine 40 scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below with unapparent fire the baby sleep is pillowed her golden tresses shade the bosom's stainless pride 45 twining like tendrils of the parasite around a marble column <\s>
<s> whence that rushing sound <\s>
<s> tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps around a lonely ruin 50 when west winds sigh and evening waves respond in whispers from the shore tis wilder than the unmeasured notes which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves the genii of the breezes sweep <\s>
<s> 55 floating on waves of music and of light the chariot of the daemon of the world descends in silent power its shape reposed within slight as some cloud that catches but the palest tinge of day 60 when evening yields to night bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue its transitory robe <\s>
<s> four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful draw that strange car of glory reins of light 65 check their unearthly speed they stop and fold their wings of braided air the daemon leaning from the ethereal car gazed on the slumbering maid <\s>
<s> human eye hath ne'er beheld 70 a shape so wild so bright so beautiful as that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep waving a starry wand hung like a mist of light <\s>
<s> such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds 75 of wakening spring arose filling the chamber and the moonlight sky <\s>
<s> maiden the world's supremest spirit beneath the shadow of her wings folds all thy memory doth inherit 80 from ruin of divinest things feelings that lure thee to betray and light of thoughts that pass away <\s>
<s> for thou hast earned a mighty boon the truths which wisest poets see 85 dimly thy mind may make its own rewarding its own majesty entranced in some diviner mood of self oblivious solitude <\s>
<s> i certainly find no trace of it among his papers and as those of his intimate friends whom i have consulted never heard of it i omit it <\s>
<s> two poems are added of some length swellfoot the tyrant and peter bell the third <\s>
<s> i have mentioned the circumstances under which they were written in the notes and need only add that they are conceived in a very different spirit from shelley's usual compositions <\s>
<s> they are specimens of the burlesque and fanciful but although they adopt a familiar style and homely imagery there shine through the radiance of the poet's imagination the earnest views and opinions of the politician and the moralist <\s>

<s> it had been my wish on presenting the public with the posthumous poems of mr <\s>
<s> shelley to have accompanied them by a biographical notice as it appeared to me that at this moment a narration of the events of my husband's life would come more gracefully from other hands than mine i applied to mr <\s>
<s> the distinguished friendship that mr <\s>
<s> shelley felt for him and the enthusiastic affection with which mr <\s>
<s> leigh hunt clings to his friend's memory seemed to point him out as the person best calculated for such an undertaking <\s>
<s> his absence from this country which prevented our mutual explanation has unfortunately rendered my scheme abortive <\s>
<s> i do not doubt but that on some other occasion he will pay this tribute to his lost friend and sincerely regret that the volume which i edit has not been honoured by its insertion <\s>
<s> the comparative solitude in which mr <\s>
<s> shelley lived was the occasion that he was personally known to few and his fearless enthusiasm in the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth the improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind was the chief reason why he like other illustrious reformers was pursued by hatred and calumny <\s>
<s> no man was ever more devoted than he to the endeavour of making those around him happy no man ever possessed friends more unfeignedly attached to him <\s>
<s> the ungrateful world did not feel his loss and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory as the murderous sea above his living frame <\s>
<s> hereafter men will lament that his transcendent powers of intellect were extinguished before they had bestowed on them their choicest treasures <\s>
<s> to his friends his loss is irremediable the wise the brave the gentle is gone for ever <\s>
<s> he is to them as a bright vision whose radiant track left behind in the memory is worth all the realities that society can afford <\s>
<s> before the critics contradict me let them appeal to any one who had ever known him <\s>
<s> to see him was to love him and his presence like ithuriel's spear was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world <\s>
