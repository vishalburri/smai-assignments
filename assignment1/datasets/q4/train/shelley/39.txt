<s> mahmud a far whisper terrible silence <\s>
<s> mahmud the sound as of the assault of an imperial city 815 the hiss of inextinguishable fire the roar of giant cannon the earthquaking fall of vast bastions and precipitous towers the shock of crags shot from strange enginery the clash of wheels and clang of armed hoofs 820 and crash of brazen mail as of the wreck of adamantine mountains the mad blast of trumpets and the neigh of raging steeds the shrieks of women whose thrill jars the blood and one sweet laugh most horrible to hear 825 as of a joyous infant waked and playing with its dead mother's breast and now more loud the mingled battle cry ha <\s>
<s> hear i not en touto nike <\s>

<s> in the dust glimmers a kingless diadem and one 835 of regal port has cast himself beneath the stream of war <\s>
<s> another proudly clad in golden arms spurs a tartarian barb into the gap and with his iron mace directs the torrent of that tide of men 840 and seems he is mahomet <\s>
<s> ahasuerus what thou seest is but the ghost of thy forgotten dream <\s>
<s> a dream itself yet less perhaps than that thou call'st reality <\s>
