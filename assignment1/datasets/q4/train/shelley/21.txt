<s> he followed certain classical authorities in figuring saturn as the good principle jupiter the usurping evil one and prometheus as the regenerator who unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence used knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil by leading mankind beyond the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance to that in which they are virtuous through wisdom <\s>
<s> jupiter punished the temerity of the titan by chaining him to a rock of caucasus and causing a vulture to devour his still renewed heart <\s>
<s> there was a prophecy afloat in heaven portending the fall of jove the secret of averting which was known only to prometheus and the god offered freedom from torture on condition of its being communicated to him <\s>
<s> according to the mythological story this referred to the offspring of thetis who was destined to be greater than his father <\s>
<s> prometheus at last bought pardon for his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts by revealing the prophecy <\s>
<s> hercules killed the vulture and set him free and thetis was married to peleus the father of achilles <\s>
<s> shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views <\s>
<s> the son greater than his father born of the nuptials of jupiter and thetis was to dethrone evil and bring back a happier reign than that of saturn <\s>
<s> prometheus defies the power of his enemy and endures centuries of torture till the hour arrives when jove blind to the real event but darkly guessing that some great good to himself will flow espouses thetis <\s>
<s> at the moment the primal power of the world drives him from his usurped throne and strength in the person of hercules liberates humanity typified in prometheus from the tortures generated by evil done or suffered <\s>
<s> asia one of the oceanides is the wife of prometheus she was according to other mythological interpretations the same as venus and nature <\s>
<s> when the benefactor of mankind is liberated nature resumes the beauty of her prime and is united to her husband the emblem of the human race in perfect and happy union <\s>
<s> in the fourth act the poet gives further scope to his imagination and idealizes the forms of creation such as we know them instead of such as they appeared to the greeks <\s>
<s> maternal earth the mighty parent is superseded by the spirit of the earth the guide of our planet through the realms of sky while his fair and weaker companion and attendant the spirit of the moon receives bliss from the annihilation of evil in the superior sphere <\s>
<s> shelley develops more particularly in the lyrics of this drama his abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the creation <\s>
<s> it requires a mind as subtle and penetrating as his own to understand the mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem <\s>
<s> they elude the ordinary reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction but they are far from vague <\s>
<s> it was his design to write prose metaphysical essays on the nature of man which would have served to explain much of what is obscure in his poetry a few scattered fragments of observations and remarks alone remain <\s>
<s> he considered these philosophical views of mind and nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry <\s>
<s> more popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible imagery <\s>
<s> shelley loved to idealize the real to gift the mechanism of the material universe with a soul and a voice and to bestow such also on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind <\s>
<s> sophocles was his great master in this species of imagery <\s>
<s> i find in one of his manuscript books some remarks on a line in the oedipus tyrannus which show at once the critical subtlety of shelley's mind and explain his apprehension of those minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us which he pronounces in the letter quoted in the note to the revolt of islam to comprehend all that is sublime in man <\s>
<s> in the greek shakespeare sophocles we find the image pollas d odous elthonta phrontidos planois a line of almost unfathomable depth of poetry yet how simple are the images in which it is arrayed <\s>
<s> coming to many ways in the wanderings of careful thought <\s>
<s> if the words odous and planois had not been used the line might have been explained in a metaphorical instead of an absolute sense as we say ways and means and wanderings for error and confusion <\s>
<s> but they meant literally paths or roads such as we tread with our feet and wanderings such as a man makes when he loses himself in a desert or roams from city to city as oedipus the speaker of this verse was destined to wander blind and asking charity <\s>
<s> what a picture does this line suggest of the mind as a wilderness of intricate paths wide as the universe which is here made its symbol a world within a world which he who seeks some knowledge with respect to what he ought to do searches throughout as he would search the external universe for some valued thing which was hidden from him upon its surface <\s>
<s> in reading shelley's poetry we often find similar verses resembling but not imitating the greek in this species of imagery for though he adopted the style he gifted it with that originality of form and colouring which sprung from his own genius <\s>
<s> in the prometheus unbound shelley fulfils the promise quoted from a letter in the note on the revolt of islam <\s>
<s> while correcting the proof sheets of that poem it struck me that the poet had indulged in an exaggerated view of the evils of restored despotism which however injurious and degrading were less openly sanguinary than the triumph of anarchy such as it appeared in france at the close of the last century <\s>
<s> but at this time a book scenes of spanish life translated by lieutenant crawford from the german of dr <\s>
<s> huber of rostock fell into my hands <\s>
<s> the account of the triumph of the priests and the serviles after the french invasion of spain in 1823 bears a strong and frightful resemblance to some of the descriptions of the massacre of the patriots in the revolt of islam the tone of the composition is calmer and more majestic the poetry more perfect as a whole and the imagination displayed at once more pleasingly beautiful and more varied and daring <\s>
<s> the description of the hours as they are seen in the cave of demogorgon is an instance of this it fills the mind as the most charming picture we long to see an artist at work to bring to our view the cars drawn by rainbow winged steeds which trample the dim winds in each there stands a wild eyed charioteer urging their flight <\s>
<s> some look behind as fiends pursued them there and yet i see no shapes but the keen stars others with burning eyes lean forth and drink with eager lips the wind of their own speed as if the thing they loved fled on before and now even now they clasped it <\s>
<s> their bright locks stream like a comet's flashing hair they all sweep onward <\s>
<s> through the whole poem there reigns a sort of calm and holy spirit of love it soothes the tortured and is hope to the expectant till the prophecy is fulfilled and love untainted by any evil becomes the law of the world <\s>
<s> england had been rendered a painful residence to shelley as much by the sort of persecution with which in those days all men of liberal opinions were visited and by the injustice he had lately endured in the court of chancery as by the symptoms of disease which made him regard a visit to italy as necessary to prolong his life <\s>
<s> an exile and strongly impressed with the feeling that the majority of his countrymen regarded him with sentiments of aversion such as his own heart could experience towards none he sheltered himself from such disgusting and painful thoughts in the calm retreats of poetry and built up a world of his own with the more pleasure since he hoped to induce some one or two to believe that the earth might become such did mankind themselves consent <\s>
<s> the charm of the roman climate helped to clothe his thoughts in greater beauty than they had ever worn before <\s>
<s> and as he wandered among the ruins made one with nature in their decay or gazed on the praxitelean shapes that throng the vatican the capitol and the palaces of rome his soul imbibed forms of loveliness which became a portion of itself <\s>
<s> there are many passages in the prometheus which show the intense delight he received from such studies and give back the impression with a beauty of poetical description peculiarly his own <\s>

<s> rome may 29 1819 <\s>
<s> a manuscript was communicated to me during my travels in italy which was copied from the archives of the cenci palace at rome and contains a detailed account of the horrors which ended in the extinction of one of the noblest and richest families of that city during the pontificate of clement viii in the year 1599 <\s>
<s> the story is that an old man having spent his life in debauchery and wickedness conceived at length an implacable hatred towards his children which showed itself towards one daughter under the form of an incestuous passion aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and violence <\s>
<s> this daughter after long and vain attempts to escape from what she considered a perpetual contamination both of body and mind at length plotted with her mother in law and brother to murder their common tyrant <\s>
<s> the young maiden who was urged to this tremendous deed by an impulse which overpowered its horror was evidently a most gentle and amiable being a creature formed to adorn and be admired and thus violently thwarted from her nature by the necessity of circumstance and opinion <\s>
<s> the deed was quickly discovered and in spite of the most earnest prayers made to the pope by the highest persons in rome the criminals were put to death <\s>
<s> the old man had during his life repeatedly bought his pardon from the pope for capital crimes of the most enormous and unspeakable kind at the price of a hundred thousand crowns the death therefore of his victims can scarcely be accounted for by the love of justice <\s>
<s> the pope among other motives for severity probably felt that whoever killed the count cenci deprived his treasury of a certain and copious source of revenue <\s>
<s> the papal government formerly took the most extraordinary precautions against the publicity of facts which offer so tragical a demonstration of its own wickedness and weakness so that the communication of the manuscript had become until very lately a matter of some difficulty such a story if told so as to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it their hopes and fears their confidences and misgivings their various interests passions and opinions acting upon and with each other yet all conspiring to one tremendous end would be as a light to make apparent some of the most dark and secret caverns of the human heart <\s>
<s> on my arrival at rome i found that the story of the cenci was a subject not to be mentioned in italian society without awakening a deep and breathless interest and that the feelings of the company never failed to incline to a romantic pity for the wrongs and a passionate exculpation of the horrible deed to which they urged her who has been mingled two centuries with the common dust <\s>
<s> all ranks of people knew the outlines of this history and participated in the overwhelming interest which it seems to have the magic of exciting in the human heart <\s>
<s> i had a copy of guido's picture of beatrice which is preserved in the colonna palace and my servant instantly recognized it as the portrait of la cenci <\s>
<s> this national and universal interest which the story produces and has produced for two centuries and among all ranks of people in a great city where the imagination is kept for ever active and awake first suggested to me the conception of its fitness for a dramatic purpose <\s>
<s> in fact it is a tragedy which has already received from its capacity of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men approbation and success <\s>
<s> nothing remained as i imagined but to clothe it to the apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action as would bring it home to their hearts <\s>
<s> the deepest and the sublimest tragic compositions king lear and the two plays in which the tale of oedipus is told were stories which already existed in tradition as matters of popular belief and interest before shakspeare and sophocles made them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of mankind <\s>
<s> this story of the cenci is indeed eminently fearful and monstrous anything like a dry exhibition of it on the stage would be insupportable <\s>
<s> the person who would treat such a subject must increase the ideal and diminish the actual horror of the events so that the pleasure which arises from the poetry which exists in these tempestuous sufferings and crimes may mitigate the pain of the contemplation of the moral deformity from which they spring <\s>
<s> there must also be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to what is vulgarly termed a moral purpose <\s>
<s> the highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind <\s>
<s> if dogmas can do more it is well but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them <\s>
<s> undoubtedly no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love <\s>
<s> revenge retaliation atonement are pernicious mistakes <\s>
<s> if beatrice had thought in this manner she would have been wiser and better but she would never have been a tragic character the few whom such an exhibition would have interested could never have been sufficiently interested for a dramatic purpose from the want of finding sympathy in their interest among the mass who surround them <\s>
<s> it is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justification it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists <\s>
<s> i have endeavoured as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conceptions of right or wrong false or true thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind <\s>
<s> they are represented as catholics and as catholics deeply tinged with religion <\s>
<s> to a protestant apprehension there will appear something unnatural in the earnest and perpetual sentiment of the relations between god and men which pervade the tragedy of the cenci <\s>
<s> it will especially be startled at the combination of an undoubting persuasion of the truth of the popular religion with a cool and determined perseverance in enormous guilt <\s>
<s> but religion in italy is not as in protestant countries a cloak to be worn on particular days or a passport which those who do not wish to be railed at carry with them to exhibit or a gloomy passion for penetrating the impenetrable mysteries of our being which terrifies its possessor at the darkness of the abyss to the brink of which it has conducted him <\s>
<s> religion coexists as it were in the mind of an italian catholic with a faith in that of which all men have the most certain knowledge <\s>
<s> it is interwoven with the whole fabric of life <\s>
<s> it is adoration faith submission penitence blind admiration not a rule for moral conduct <\s>
