<s> but prophecy requires proof in its character as a miracle we have no right to suppose that a man foreknew future events from god until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold <\s>
<s> it is more probable that writings pretending to divine inspiration should have been fabricated after the fulfilment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired when we consider that the latter supposition makes god at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers particularly as we have numberless instances of false religions and forged prophecies of things long past and no accredited case of god having conversed with men directly or indirectly <\s>
<s> it is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence but this is far from being a legitimate proof of a divine revelation as many men not pretending to the character of a prophet have nevertheless in this sense prophesied <\s>

<s> if we admit the truth of the christian religion on testimony such as this we must admit on the same strength of evidence that god has affixed the highest rewards to belief and the eternal tortures of the never dying worm to disbelief both of which have been demonstrated to be involuntary <\s>
<s> the last proof of the christian religion depends on the influence of the holy ghost <\s>
<s> theologians divide the influence of the holy ghost into its ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation <\s>
<s> the latter is supposed to be that which inspired the prophets and apostles and the former to be the grace of god which summarily makes known the truth of his revelation to those whose mind is fitted for its reception by a submissive perusal of his word <\s>
