<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>
<s> in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake <\s>
<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>
<s> they gave him entrance free to bear me thence <\s>
<s> since this the old man said seven years are spent while slowly truth on thy benighted sense 1510 has crept the hope which wildered it has lent meanwhile to me the power of a sublime intent <\s>
<s> yes from the records of my youthful state and from the lore of bards and sages old from whatsoe'er my wakened thoughts create 1515 out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more 1520 than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore <\s>

<s> the tyrants of the golden city tremble at voices which are heard about the streets the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble the lies of their own heart but when one meets another at the shrine he inly weets 1535 though he says nothing that the truth is known murderers are pale upon the judgement seats and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne <\s>
<s> kind thoughts and mighty hopes and gentle deeds 1540 abound for fearless love and the pure law of mild equality and peace succeeds to faiths which long have held the world in awe bloody and false and cold as whirlpools draw all wrecks of ocean to their chasm the sway 1545 of thy strong genius laon which foresaw this hope compels all spirits to obey which round thy secret strength now throng in wide array <\s>
<s> for i have been thy passive instrument as thus the old man spake his countenance 1550 gleamed on me like a spirit's thou hast lent to me to all the power to advance towards this unforeseen deliverance from our ancestral chains ay thou didst rear that lamp of hope on high which time nor chance 1555 nor change may not extinguish and my share of good was o'er the world its gathered beams to bear <\s>

<s> perchance blood need not flow if thou at length wouldst rise perchance the very slaves would spare their brethren and themselves great is the strength of words for lately did a maiden fair 1570 who from her childhood has been taught to bear the tyrant's heaviest yoke arise and make her sex the law of truth and freedom hear and with these quiet words for thine own sake i prithee spare me did with ruth so take 1575 19 <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep 1100 seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homeward neither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passion thus subdued like evening shades that o'er the mountains creep 1105 we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude <\s>
<s> what thoughts had sway o'er cythna's lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber 1110 of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memory's theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed 1115 sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast <\s>
<s> two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled 1120 from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlet's shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave <\s>
<s> we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air o'er every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone 1130 had being clearer than its own could be and cythna's pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony <\s>
<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense 1155 to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare 1160 and whose degraded limbs the tyrant's garb did wear <\s>
<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> with brazen links my naked limbs they bound 1230 the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned <\s>
<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>
<s> i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever 1270 its adamantine links that i might die o liberty <\s>

<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>
<s> in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake <\s>
<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>
<s> they gave him entrance free to bear me thence <\s>

<s> yes from the records of my youthful state and from the lore of bards and sages old from whatsoe'er my wakened thoughts create 1515 out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more 1520 than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore <\s>

<s> the tyrants of the golden city tremble at voices which are heard about the streets the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble the lies of their own heart but when one meets another at the shrine he inly weets 1535 though he says nothing that the truth is known murderers are pale upon the judgement seats and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep 1100 seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homeward neither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passion thus subdued like evening shades that o'er the mountains creep 1105 we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude <\s>
<s> what thoughts had sway o'er cythna's lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber 1110 of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memory's theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed 1115 sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast <\s>
<s> two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled 1120 from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlet's shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave <\s>
<s> we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air o'er every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone 1130 had being clearer than its own could be and cythna's pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony <\s>
<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense 1155 to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare 1160 and whose degraded limbs the tyrant's garb did wear <\s>
<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> with brazen links my naked limbs they bound 1230 the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned <\s>
<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>
<s> i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever 1270 its adamantine links that i might die o liberty <\s>

<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>
<s> in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake <\s>
<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>
<s> they gave him entrance free to bear me thence <\s>

<s> yes from the records of my youthful state and from the lore of bards and sages old from whatsoe'er my wakened thoughts create 1515 out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more 1520 than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore <\s>

<s> the tyrants of the golden city tremble at voices which are heard about the streets the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble the lies of their own heart but when one meets another at the shrine he inly weets 1535 though he says nothing that the truth is known murderers are pale upon the judgement seats and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep 1100 seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homeward neither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passion thus subdued like evening shades that o'er the mountains creep 1105 we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude <\s>
<s> what thoughts had sway o'er cythna's lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber 1110 of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memory's theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed 1115 sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast <\s>
<s> two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled 1120 from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlet's shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave <\s>
<s> we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air o'er every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone 1130 had being clearer than its own could be and cythna's pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony <\s>
<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense 1155 to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare 1160 and whose degraded limbs the tyrant's garb did wear <\s>
<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> with brazen links my naked limbs they bound 1230 the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned <\s>
<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>
<s> i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever 1270 its adamantine links that i might die o liberty <\s>

<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>
<s> in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake <\s>
<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>
<s> they gave him entrance free to bear me thence <\s>

<s> yes from the records of my youthful state and from the lore of bards and sages old from whatsoe'er my wakened thoughts create 1515 out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more 1520 than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore <\s>

<s> the tyrants of the golden city tremble at voices which are heard about the streets the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble the lies of their own heart but when one meets another at the shrine he inly weets 1535 though he says nothing that the truth is known murderers are pale upon the judgement seats and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep 1100 seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homeward neither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passion thus subdued like evening shades that o'er the mountains creep 1105 we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude <\s>
<s> what thoughts had sway o'er cythna's lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber 1110 of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memory's theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed 1115 sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast <\s>
<s> two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled 1120 from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlet's shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave <\s>
<s> we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air o'er every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone 1130 had being clearer than its own could be and cythna's pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony <\s>
<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense 1155 to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare 1160 and whose degraded limbs the tyrant's garb did wear <\s>
<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> with brazen links my naked limbs they bound 1230 the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned <\s>
<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>
<s> i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever 1270 its adamantine links that i might die o liberty <\s>

<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>
<s> in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake <\s>
<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>
<s> it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty <\s>
<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth <\s>
<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>
<s> that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of ever burning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp 1480 of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read <\s>
<s> but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know 1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood 10 <\s>
<s> and that the multitude was gathering wide 1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victor's flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue 1500 was as a sword of truth young laon's name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among <\s>
<s> he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence 1505 the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence <\s>
<s> they gave him entrance free to bear me thence <\s>

<s> yes from the records of my youthful state and from the lore of bards and sages old from whatsoe'er my wakened thoughts create 1515 out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more 1520 than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore <\s>

<s> the tyrants of the golden city tremble at voices which are heard about the streets the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble the lies of their own heart but when one meets another at the shrine he inly weets 1535 though he says nothing that the truth is known murderers are pale upon the judgement seats and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> thus madness came again a milder madness 1450 which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good 1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that isle fretted flood <\s>
<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>

<s> i chewed the bitter dust 1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust <\s>
<s> my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst o'er the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep 1300 with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless <\s>
<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>
<s> whose was that withered form <\s>
<s> it seemed that cythna's ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost 1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed <\s>
<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep <\s>
<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone 1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivy trails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest sea shells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown 1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of man's art nursed amid nature's brood <\s>
<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>
<s> the rock built barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as many coloured as the snake 1445 that girds eternity <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>
<s> he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled 1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound 1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound 30 <\s>
<s> as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbour bar 1370 and the shrill sea wind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are 1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark <\s>
<s> for now indeed over the salt sea billow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow 1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent o'er me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent 1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent <\s>
<s> a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly 1390 though he said little did he speak to me <\s>

<s> i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year <\s>
<s> a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the ocean streams 1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled <\s>
<s> and then the night wind steaming from the shore 1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtle blossoms starring the dim grove 1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove <\s>

<s> when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said 1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed 1430 upon a couch of grass and oak leaves interlaced <\s>
<s> the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay 1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become <\s>

<s> he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart 1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart 1465 a glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak <\s>
<s> thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did re assume through the enchantments of that hermit old 1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope o'er man's bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friend's heart i told my thought 1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not <\s>

<s> i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep 1100 seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homeward neither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passion thus subdued like evening shades that o'er the mountains creep 1105 we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude <\s>
<s> what thoughts had sway o'er cythna's lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber 1110 of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memory's theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed 1115 sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast <\s>
<s> two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled 1120 from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlet's shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave <\s>
<s> we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air o'er every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone 1130 had being clearer than its own could be and cythna's pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony <\s>
<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense 1155 to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare 1160 and whose degraded limbs the tyrant's garb did wear <\s>
<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>

<s> morn fled noon came evening then night descended 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete 1140 and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat <\s>

<s> and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek 1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd 'twas cythna's cry <\s>
<s> beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie <\s>

<s> what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke 1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow 1205 of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white ocean's flow <\s>
<s> upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers o'er the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by 1210 had made a landmark o'er its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste <\s>
<s> they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care 1220 guided my steps the cavern paths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torch's fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung <\s>

<s> with brazen links my naked limbs they bound 1230 the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned <\s>
<s> the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see 1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay <\s>
<s> it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed 1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone <\s>

<s> i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped <\s>
<s> it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark 1265 its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies <\s>
<s> i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever 1270 its adamantine links that i might die o liberty <\s>

<s> the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels 1310 foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied <\s>
<s> the sense of day and night of false and true 1315 was dead within me <\s>

<s> 1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memory's waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now <\s>
<s> methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare 1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air 1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung <\s>
<s> a woman's shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the many coloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew 1335 to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes <\s>

<s> and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon 1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose <\s>

<s> for i have been thy passive instrument as thus the old man spake his countenance 1550 gleamed on me like a spirit's thou hast lent to me to all the power to advance towards this unforeseen deliverance from our ancestral chains ay thou didst rear that lamp of hope on high which time nor chance 1555 nor change may not extinguish and my share of good was o'er the world its gathered beams to bear <\s>
<s> am both unknown and old and though the woof of wisdom i know well to dye in hues of language i am cold 1560 in seeming and the hopes which inly dwell my manners note that i did long repel but laon's name to the tumultuous throng were like the star whose beams the waves compel and tempests and his soul subduing tongue 1565 were as a lance to quell the mailed crest of wrong <\s>
<s> perchance blood need not flow if thou at length wouldst rise perchance the very slaves would spare their brethren and themselves great is the strength of words for lately did a maiden fair 1570 who from her childhood has been taught to bear the tyrant's heaviest yoke arise and make her sex the law of truth and freedom hear and with these quiet words for thine own sake i prithee spare me did with ruth so take 1575 19 <\s>
<s> all hearts that even the torturer who had bound her meek calm frame ere it was yet impaled loosened her weeping then nor could be found one human hand to harm her unassailed therefore she walks through the great city veiled 1580 in virtue's adamantine eloquence gainst scorn and death and pain thus trebly mailed and blending in the smiles of that defence the serpent and the dove wisdom and innocence <\s>
<s> the wild eyed women throng around her path 1585 from their luxurious dungeons from the dust of meaner thralls from the oppressor's wrath or the caresses of his sated lust they congregate in her they put their trust the tyrants send their armed slaves to quell 1590 her power they even like a thunder gust caught by some forest bend beneath the spell of that young maiden's speech and to their chiefs rebel <\s>
<s> thus she doth equal laws and justice teach to woman outraged and polluted long 1595 gathering the sweetest fruit in human reach for those fair hands now free while armed wrong trembles before her look though it be strong thousands thus dwell beside her virgins bright and matrons with their babes a stately throng <\s>
<s> 1600 lovers renew the vows which they did plight in early faith and hearts long parted now unite 22 <\s>
<s> and homeless orphans find a home near her and those poor victims of the proud no less fair wrecks on whom the smiling world with stir 1605 thrusts the redemption of its wickedness in squalid huts and in its palaces sits lust alone while o'er the land is borne her voice whose awful sweetness doth repress all evil and her foes relenting turn 1610 and cast the vote of love in hope's abandoned urn <\s>
<s> so in the populous city a young maiden has baffled havoc of the prey which he marks as his own whene'er with chains o'erladen men make them arms to hurl down tyranny 1615 false arbiter between the bound and free and o'er the land in hamlets and in towns the multitudes collect tumultuously and throng in arms but tyranny disowns their claim and gathers strength around its trembling thrones <\s>
