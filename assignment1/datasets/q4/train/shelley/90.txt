<s> rossetti's happy conjecture clod seems to forman a doubtful emendation as shelley may have used clog in its figurative sense of weight encumbrance hardly as here in a poetical figure that would be to use a metaphor within a metaphor <\s>
<s> shelley compares his heart to a concrete object if clog is right the word must be taken in one or other of its two recognized literal senses 'a wooden shoe or a block of wood tied round the neck or to the leg of a horse or a dog <\s>
<s> again it is of others hearts not of his own that shelley here deplores the icy coldness and weight besides how could he appropriately describe his heart as a weight or encumbrance upon the free play of impulse and emotion seeing that for shelley above all men the heart was itself the main source and spring of all feeling and action <\s>
<s> that source he complains has been dried up its emotions desiccated by the crushing impact of other hearts heavy hard and cold as stone <\s>

<s> the word revived suits well with clod but what is a revived clog <\s>
<s> finally the first two lines of the following stanza 7 seem decisive in favour of roseetti's word <\s>
<s> if any one wonders how a misprint overlooked in 1818 could after twenty one years still remain undiscovered in 1839 let him consider the case of clog in lamb's parody on southey's and coleridge's dactyls lamb letter to coleridge july 1 1796 ): sorely your dactyls do drag along limp footed sad is the measure that hangs a clog round em so etc etc <\s>
<s> here the misprint clod which in 1868 appeared in moxon's edition of the letters of charles lamb has through five successive editions and under many editors including fitzgerald ainger and macdonald held its ground even to the present day and this notwithstanding the preservation of the true reading clog in the texts of talfourd and carew hazlitt <\s>

<s> and walked as free etc <\s>

<s> shelley's text 1839 has a semicolon after plumes line 203 which rossetti adopts <\s>
