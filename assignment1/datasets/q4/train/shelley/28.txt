<s> camillo the pope is stern not to be moved or bent <\s>
<s> he looked as calm and keen as is the engine which tortures and which kills exempt itself from aught that it inflicts a marble form a rite a law a custom not a man <\s>

<s> then to another thou dost this in virtue of thy place tis well <\s>
<s> he turned to me then looking deprecation and said these three words coldly they must die <\s>
<s> bernardo and yet you left him not <\s>
<s> camillo i urged him still 15 pleading as i could guess the devilish wrong which prompted your unnatural parent's death <\s>

<s> parricide grows so rife 20 that soon for some just cause no doubt the young will strangle us all dozing in our chairs <\s>

<s> you are my nephew you come to ask their pardon stay a moment 25 here is their sentence never see me more till to the letter it be all fulfilled <\s>
<s> bernardo o god not so <\s>
<s> i did believe indeed that all you said was but sad preparation for happy news <\s>
<s> oh there are words and looks 30 to bend the sternest purpose <\s>
<s> once i knew them now i forget them at my dearest need <\s>
<s> what think you if i seek him out and bathe his feet and robe with hot and bitter tears <\s>
<s> importune him with prayers vexing his brain 35 with my perpetual cries until in rage he strike me with his pastoral cross and trample upon my prostrate head so that my blood may stain the senseless dust on which he treads and remorse waken mercy <\s>

<s> beatrice wildly ]: o my god <\s>
<s> can it be possible i have to die so suddenly <\s>
<s> so young to go under the obscure cold rotting wormy ground <\s>

<s> even though dead does not his spirit live in all that breathe 70 and work for me and mine still the same ruin scorn pain despair <\s>
<s> who ever yet returned to teach the laws of death's untrodden realm <\s>
