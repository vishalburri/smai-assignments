<s> swift as an eagle stooping from the plain of morning light into some shadowy wood he plunged through the green silence of the main through many a cavern which the eternal flood had scooped as dark lairs for its monster brood 2915 and among mighty shapes which fled in wonder and among mightier shadows which pursued his heels he wound until the dark rocks under he touched a golden chain a sound arose like thunder <\s>
<s> a stunning clang of massive bolts redoubling 2920 beneath the deep a burst of waters driven as from the roots of the sea raging and bubbling and in that roof of crags a space was riven through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven shot through the lines of many waves inwoven 2925 like sunlight through acacia woods at even through which his way the diver having cloven passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven <\s>
<s> and then she said he laid me in a cave above the waters by that chasm of sea 2930 a fountain round and vast in which the wave imprisoned boiled and leaped perpetually down which one moment resting he did flee winning the adverse depth that spacious cell like an hupaithric temple wide and high 2935 whose aery dome is inaccessible was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell <\s>
<s> below the fountain's brink was richly paven with the deep's wealth coral and pearl and sand like spangling gold and purple shells engraven 2940 with mystic legends by no mortal hand left there when thronging to the moon's command the gathering waves rent the hesperian gate of mountains and on such bright floor did stand columns and shapes like statues and the state 2945 of kingless thrones which earth did in her heart create <\s>
<s> the fiend of madness which had made its prey of my poor heart was lulled to sleep awhile there was an interval of many a day and a sea eagle brought me food the while 2950 whose nest was built in that untrodden isle and who to be the gaoler had been taught of that strange dungeon as a friend whose smile like light and rest at morn and even is sought that wild bird was to me till madness misery brought <\s>

<s> methought i was about to be a mother month after month went by and still i dreamed 2975 that we should soon be all to one another i and my child and still new pulses seemed to beat beside my heart and still i deemed there was a babe within and when the rain of winter through the rifted cavern streamed 2980 methought after a lapse of lingering pain i saw that lovely shape which near my heart had lain <\s>
<s> it was a babe beautiful from its birth it was like thee dear love its eyes were thine its brow its lips and so upon the earth 2985 it laid its fingers as now rest on mine thine own beloved twas a dream divine even to remember how it fled how swift how utterly might make the heart repine though twas a dream then cythna did uplift 2990 her looks on mine as if some doubt she sought to shift 19 <\s>
<s> a doubt which would not flee a tenderness of questioning grief a source of thronging tears which having passed as one whom sobs oppress she spoke yes in the wilderness of years 2995 her memory aye like a green home appears she sucked her fill even at this breast sweet love for many months <\s>
<s> i had no mortal fears methought i felt her lips and breath approve it was a human thing which to my bosom clove <\s>
<s> i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon when zenith stars were trembling on the wave or when the beams of the invisible moon or sun from many a prism within the cave their gem born shadows to the water gave 3005 her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand from the swift lights which might that fountain pave she would mark one and laugh when that command slighting it lingered there and could not understand <\s>
<s> methought her looks began to talk with me 3010 and no articulate sounds but something sweet her lips would frame so sweet it could not be that it was meaningless her touch would meet mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat in response while we slept and on a day 3015 when i was happiest in that strange retreat with heaps of golden shells we two did play both infants weaving wings for time's perpetual way <\s>
<s> ere night methought her waning eyes were grown weary with joy and tired with our delight 3020 we on the earth like sister twins lay down on one fair mother's bosom from that night she fled like those illusions clear and bright which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest and her flight 3025 though twas the death of brainless fantasy yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery <\s>
<s> it seemed that in the dreary night the diver who brought me thither came again and bore my child away <\s>
<s> i saw the waters quiver 3030 when he so swiftly sunk as once before then morning came it shone even as of yore but i was changed the very life was gone out of my heart i wasted more and more day after day and sitting there alone 3035 vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> i was no longer mad and yet methought my breasts were swoln and changed in every vein the blood stood still one moment while that thought was passing with a gush of sickening pain 3040 it ebbed even to its withered springs again when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned from that most strange delusion which would fain have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned with more than human love then left it unreturned <\s>
<s> so now my reason was restored to me i struggled with that dream which like a beast most fierce and beauteous in my memory had made its lair and on my heart did feast but all that cave and all its shapes possessed 3050 by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one some smile some look some gesture which had blessed me heretofore i sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> time passed i know not whether months or years 3055 for day nor night nor change of seasons made its note but thoughts and unavailing tears and i became at last even as a shade a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed till it be thin as air until one even 3060 a nautilus upon the fountain played spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven <\s>
<s> and when the eagle came that lovely thing oaring with rosy feet its silver boat 3065 fled near me as for shelter on slow wing the eagle hovering o'er his prey did float but when he saw that i with fear did note his purpose proffering my own food to him the eager plumes subsided on his throat 3070 he came where that bright child of sea did swim and o'er it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim <\s>
<s> this wakened me it gave me human strength and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose but i resumed my ancient powers at length 3075 my spirit felt again like one of those like thine whose fate it is to make the woes of humankind their prey what was this cave <\s>
<s> its deep foundation no firm purpose knows immutable resistless strong to save 3080 like mind while yet it mocks the all devouring grave <\s>
<s> and where was laon <\s>
<s> might my heart be dead while that far dearer heart could move and be <\s>
<s> or whilst over the earth the pall was spread which i had sworn to rend <\s>
<s> i might be free 3085 could i but win that friendly bird to me to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought by intercourse of mutual imagery of objects if such aid he could be taught but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought <\s>
<s> we live in our own world and mine was made from glorious fantasies of hope departed aye we are darkened with their floating shade or cast a lustre on them time imparted such power to me i became fearless hearted 3095 my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind and piercing like the morn now it has darted its lustre on all hidden things behind yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind <\s>
<s> my mind became the book through which i grew 3100 wise in all human wisdom and its cave which like a mine i rifled through and through to me the keeping of its secrets gave one mind the type of all the moveless wave whose calm reflects all moving things that are 3105 necessity and love and life the grave and sympathy fountains of hope and fear justice and truth and time and the world's natural sphere <\s>
<s> and on the sand would i make signs to range these woofs as they were woven of my thought 3110 clear elemental shapes whose smallest change a subtler language within language wrought the key of truths which once were dimly taught in old crotona and sweet melodies of love in that lorn solitude i caught 3115 from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize <\s>
<s> thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will as in a winged chariot o'er the plain of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill 3120 my heart with joy and there we sate again on the gray margin of the glimmering main happy as then but wiser far for we smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain fear faith and slavery and mankind was free 3125 equal and pure and wise in wisdom's prophecy <\s>
<s> for to my will my fancies were as slaves to do their sweet and subtile ministries and oft from that bright fountain's shadowy waves they would make human throngs gather and rise 3130 to combat with my overflowing eyes and voice made deep with passion thus i grew familiar with the shock and the surprise and war of earthly minds from which i drew the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew <\s>
<s> and thus my prison was the populous earth where i saw even as misery dreams of morn before the east has given its glory birth religion's pomp made desolate by the scorn of wisdom's faintest smile and thrones uptorn 3140 and dwellings of mild people interspersed with undivided fields of ripening corn and love made free a hope which we have nursed even with our blood and tears until its glory burst <\s>
<s> all is not lost <\s>
<s> there is some recompense 3145 for hope whose fountain can be thus profound even throned evil's splendid impotence girt by its hell of power the secret sound of hymns to truth and freedom the dread bound of life and death passed fearlessly and well 3150 dungeons wherein the high resolve is found racks which degraded woman's greatness tell and what may else be good and irresistible <\s>
<s> such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare in storm encompassed isles we cherish yet 3155 in this dark ruin such were mine even there as in its sleep some odorous violet while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet breathes in prophetic dreams of day's uprise or as ere scythian frost in fear has met 3160 spring's messengers descending from the skies the buds foreknow their life this hope must ever rise <\s>
<s> so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked with sound as if the world's wide continent 3165 had fallen in universal ruin wracked and through the cleft streamed in one cataract the stifling waters when i woke the flood whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked was ebbing round me and my bright abode 3170 before me yawned a chasm desert and bare and broad <\s>
<s> above me was the sky beneath the sea i stood upon a point of shattered stone and heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously with splash and shock into the deep anon 3175 all ceased and there was silence wide and lone <\s>
<s> i felt that i was free <\s>
<s> the ocean spray quivered beneath my feet the broad heaven shone around and in my hair the winds did play lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way <\s>

<s> and when they saw one sitting on a crag 3190 they sent a boat to me the sailors rowed in awe through many a new and fearful jag of overhanging rock through which there flowed the foam of streams that cannot make abode <\s>

<s> i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon when zenith stars were trembling on the wave or when the beams of the invisible moon or sun from many a prism within the cave their gem born shadows to the water gave 3005 her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand from the swift lights which might that fountain pave she would mark one and laugh when that command slighting it lingered there and could not understand <\s>
<s> methought her looks began to talk with me 3010 and no articulate sounds but something sweet her lips would frame so sweet it could not be that it was meaningless her touch would meet mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat in response while we slept and on a day 3015 when i was happiest in that strange retreat with heaps of golden shells we two did play both infants weaving wings for time's perpetual way <\s>
<s> ere night methought her waning eyes were grown weary with joy and tired with our delight 3020 we on the earth like sister twins lay down on one fair mother's bosom from that night she fled like those illusions clear and bright which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest and her flight 3025 though twas the death of brainless fantasy yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery <\s>
<s> it seemed that in the dreary night the diver who brought me thither came again and bore my child away <\s>
<s> i saw the waters quiver 3030 when he so swiftly sunk as once before then morning came it shone even as of yore but i was changed the very life was gone out of my heart i wasted more and more day after day and sitting there alone 3035 vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> i was no longer mad and yet methought my breasts were swoln and changed in every vein the blood stood still one moment while that thought was passing with a gush of sickening pain 3040 it ebbed even to its withered springs again when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned from that most strange delusion which would fain have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned with more than human love then left it unreturned <\s>
<s> so now my reason was restored to me i struggled with that dream which like a beast most fierce and beauteous in my memory had made its lair and on my heart did feast but all that cave and all its shapes possessed 3050 by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one some smile some look some gesture which had blessed me heretofore i sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> time passed i know not whether months or years 3055 for day nor night nor change of seasons made its note but thoughts and unavailing tears and i became at last even as a shade a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed till it be thin as air until one even 3060 a nautilus upon the fountain played spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven <\s>
<s> and when the eagle came that lovely thing oaring with rosy feet its silver boat 3065 fled near me as for shelter on slow wing the eagle hovering o'er his prey did float but when he saw that i with fear did note his purpose proffering my own food to him the eager plumes subsided on his throat 3070 he came where that bright child of sea did swim and o'er it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim <\s>
<s> this wakened me it gave me human strength and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose but i resumed my ancient powers at length 3075 my spirit felt again like one of those like thine whose fate it is to make the woes of humankind their prey what was this cave <\s>
<s> its deep foundation no firm purpose knows immutable resistless strong to save 3080 like mind while yet it mocks the all devouring grave <\s>
<s> and where was laon <\s>
<s> might my heart be dead while that far dearer heart could move and be <\s>
<s> or whilst over the earth the pall was spread which i had sworn to rend <\s>
<s> i might be free 3085 could i but win that friendly bird to me to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought by intercourse of mutual imagery of objects if such aid he could be taught but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought <\s>
<s> we live in our own world and mine was made from glorious fantasies of hope departed aye we are darkened with their floating shade or cast a lustre on them time imparted such power to me i became fearless hearted 3095 my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind and piercing like the morn now it has darted its lustre on all hidden things behind yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind <\s>
<s> my mind became the book through which i grew 3100 wise in all human wisdom and its cave which like a mine i rifled through and through to me the keeping of its secrets gave one mind the type of all the moveless wave whose calm reflects all moving things that are 3105 necessity and love and life the grave and sympathy fountains of hope and fear justice and truth and time and the world's natural sphere <\s>
<s> and on the sand would i make signs to range these woofs as they were woven of my thought 3110 clear elemental shapes whose smallest change a subtler language within language wrought the key of truths which once were dimly taught in old crotona and sweet melodies of love in that lorn solitude i caught 3115 from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize <\s>
<s> thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will as in a winged chariot o'er the plain of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill 3120 my heart with joy and there we sate again on the gray margin of the glimmering main happy as then but wiser far for we smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain fear faith and slavery and mankind was free 3125 equal and pure and wise in wisdom's prophecy <\s>
<s> for to my will my fancies were as slaves to do their sweet and subtile ministries and oft from that bright fountain's shadowy waves they would make human throngs gather and rise 3130 to combat with my overflowing eyes and voice made deep with passion thus i grew familiar with the shock and the surprise and war of earthly minds from which i drew the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew <\s>
<s> and thus my prison was the populous earth where i saw even as misery dreams of morn before the east has given its glory birth religion's pomp made desolate by the scorn of wisdom's faintest smile and thrones uptorn 3140 and dwellings of mild people interspersed with undivided fields of ripening corn and love made free a hope which we have nursed even with our blood and tears until its glory burst <\s>
<s> all is not lost <\s>
<s> there is some recompense 3145 for hope whose fountain can be thus profound even throned evil's splendid impotence girt by its hell of power the secret sound of hymns to truth and freedom the dread bound of life and death passed fearlessly and well 3150 dungeons wherein the high resolve is found racks which degraded woman's greatness tell and what may else be good and irresistible <\s>
<s> such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare in storm encompassed isles we cherish yet 3155 in this dark ruin such were mine even there as in its sleep some odorous violet while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet breathes in prophetic dreams of day's uprise or as ere scythian frost in fear has met 3160 spring's messengers descending from the skies the buds foreknow their life this hope must ever rise <\s>
<s> so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked with sound as if the world's wide continent 3165 had fallen in universal ruin wracked and through the cleft streamed in one cataract the stifling waters when i woke the flood whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked was ebbing round me and my bright abode 3170 before me yawned a chasm desert and bare and broad <\s>
<s> above me was the sky beneath the sea i stood upon a point of shattered stone and heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously with splash and shock into the deep anon 3175 all ceased and there was silence wide and lone <\s>
<s> i felt that i was free <\s>
<s> the ocean spray quivered beneath my feet the broad heaven shone around and in my hair the winds did play lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way <\s>

<s> and when they saw one sitting on a crag 3190 they sent a boat to me the sailors rowed in awe through many a new and fearful jag of overhanging rock through which there flowed the foam of streams that cannot make abode <\s>

<s> there we unheeding sate in the communion of interchanged vows which with a rite of faith most sweet and sacred stamped our union few were the living hearts which could unite 2680 like ours or celebrate a bridal night with such close sympathies for they had sprung from linked youth and from the gentle might of earliest love delayed and cherished long which common hopes and fears made like a tempest strong <\s>
<s> and such is nature's law divine that those who grow together cannot choose but love if faith or custom do not interpose or common slavery mar what else might move all gentlest thoughts as in the sacred grove 2690 which shades the springs of ethiopian nile that living tree which if the arrowy dove strike with her shadow shrinks in fear awhile but its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile 41 <\s>
<s> and clings to them when darkness may dissever 2695 the close caresses of all duller plants which bloom on the wide earth thus we for ever were linked for love had nursed us in the haunts where knowledge from its secret source enchants young hearts with the fresh music of its springing 2700 ere yet its gathered flood feeds human wants as the great nile feeds egypt ever flinging light on the woven boughs which o'er its waves are swinging <\s>
<s> the tones of cythna's voice like echoes were of those far murmuring streams they rose and fell 2705 mixed with mine own in the tempestuous air and so we sate until our talk befell of the late ruin swift and horrible and how those seeds of hope might yet be sown whose fruit is evil's mortal poison well 2710 for us this ruin made a watch tower lone but cythna's eyes looked faint and now two days were gone 43 <\s>
<s> since she had food therefore i did awaken the tartar steed who from his ebon mane soon as the clinging slumbers he had shaken 2715 bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein following me obediently with pain of heart so deep and dread that one caress when lips and heart refuse to part again till they have told their fill could scarce express 2720 the anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness 44 <\s>
<s> cythna beheld me part as i bestrode that willing steed the tempest and the night which gave my path its safety as i rode down the ravine of rocks did soon unite 2725 the darkness and the tumult of their might borne on all winds far through the streaming rain floating at intervals the garments white of cythna gleamed and her voice once again came to me on the gust and soon i reached the plain <\s>
<s> i dreaded not the tempest nor did he who bore me but his eyeballs wide and red turned on the lightning's cleft exultingly and when the earth beneath his tameless tread shook with the sullen thunder he would spread 2735 his nostrils to the blast and joyously mock the fierce peal with neighings thus we sped o'er the lit plain and soon i could descry where death and fire had gorged the spoil of victory <\s>
<s> there was a desolate village in a wood 2740 whose bloom inwoven leaves now scattering fed the hungry storm it was a place of blood a heap of hearthless walls the flames were dead within those dwellings now the life had fled from all those corpses now but the wide sky 2745 flooded with lightning was ribbed overhead by the black rafters and around did lie women and babes and men slaughtered confusedly <\s>
<s> beside the fountain in the market place dismounting i beheld those corpses stare 2750 with horny eyes upon each other's face and on the earth and on the vacant air and upon me close to the waters where i stooped to slake my thirst i shrank to taste for the salt bitterness of blood was there 2755 but tied the steed beside and sought in haste if any yet survived amid that ghastly waste <\s>
<s> no living thing was there beside one woman whom i found wandering in the streets and she was withered from a likeness of aught human 2760 into a fiend by some strange misery soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me and glued her burning lips to mine and laughed with a loud long and frantic laugh of glee and cried now mortal thou hast deeply quaffed 2765 the plague's blue kisses soon millions shall pledge the draught <\s>
<s> my name is pestilence this bosom dry once fed two babes a sister and a brother when i came home one in the blood did lie of three death wounds the flames had ate the other <\s>
<s> 2770 since then i have no longer been a mother but i am pestilence hither and thither i flit about that i may slay and smother all lips which i have kissed must surely wither but death's if thou art he we'll go to work together <\s>

<s> as thus she spake she grasped me with the strength 2785 of madness and by many a ruined hearth she led and over many a corpse at length we came to a lone hut where on the earth which made its floor she in her ghastly mirth gathering from all those homes now desolate 2790 had piled three heaps of loaves making a dearth among the dead round which she set in state a ring of cold stiff babes silent and stark they sate <\s>

<s> and vainly having with her madness striven if i might win her to return with me departed <\s>
<s> in the eastern beams of heaven 2805 the lightning now grew pallid rapidly as by the shore of the tempestuous sea the dark steed bore me and the mountain gray soon echoed to his hoofs and i could see cythna among the rocks where she alway 2810 had sate with anxious eyes fixed on the lingering day <\s>
<s> and joy was ours to meet she was most pale famished and wet and weary so i cast my arms around her lest her steps should fail as to our home we went and thus embraced 2815 her full heart seemed a deeper joy to taste than e'er the prosperous know the steed behind trod peacefully along the mountain waste we reached our home ere morning could unbind night's latest veil and on our bridal couch reclined <\s>

<s> i had no mortal fears methought i felt her lips and breath approve it was a human thing which to my bosom clove <\s>
<s> i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon when zenith stars were trembling on the wave or when the beams of the invisible moon or sun from many a prism within the cave their gem born shadows to the water gave 3005 her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand from the swift lights which might that fountain pave she would mark one and laugh when that command slighting it lingered there and could not understand <\s>
<s> methought her looks began to talk with me 3010 and no articulate sounds but something sweet her lips would frame so sweet it could not be that it was meaningless her touch would meet mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat in response while we slept and on a day 3015 when i was happiest in that strange retreat with heaps of golden shells we two did play both infants weaving wings for time's perpetual way <\s>
<s> ere night methought her waning eyes were grown weary with joy and tired with our delight 3020 we on the earth like sister twins lay down on one fair mother's bosom from that night she fled like those illusions clear and bright which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest and her flight 3025 though twas the death of brainless fantasy yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery <\s>
<s> it seemed that in the dreary night the diver who brought me thither came again and bore my child away <\s>
<s> i saw the waters quiver 3030 when he so swiftly sunk as once before then morning came it shone even as of yore but i was changed the very life was gone out of my heart i wasted more and more day after day and sitting there alone 3035 vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> i was no longer mad and yet methought my breasts were swoln and changed in every vein the blood stood still one moment while that thought was passing with a gush of sickening pain 3040 it ebbed even to its withered springs again when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned from that most strange delusion which would fain have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned with more than human love then left it unreturned <\s>
<s> so now my reason was restored to me i struggled with that dream which like a beast most fierce and beauteous in my memory had made its lair and on my heart did feast but all that cave and all its shapes possessed 3050 by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one some smile some look some gesture which had blessed me heretofore i sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan <\s>
<s> time passed i know not whether months or years 3055 for day nor night nor change of seasons made its note but thoughts and unavailing tears and i became at last even as a shade a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed till it be thin as air until one even 3060 a nautilus upon the fountain played spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven <\s>
<s> and when the eagle came that lovely thing oaring with rosy feet its silver boat 3065 fled near me as for shelter on slow wing the eagle hovering o'er his prey did float but when he saw that i with fear did note his purpose proffering my own food to him the eager plumes subsided on his throat 3070 he came where that bright child of sea did swim and o'er it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim <\s>
<s> this wakened me it gave me human strength and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose but i resumed my ancient powers at length 3075 my spirit felt again like one of those like thine whose fate it is to make the woes of humankind their prey what was this cave <\s>
<s> its deep foundation no firm purpose knows immutable resistless strong to save 3080 like mind while yet it mocks the all devouring grave <\s>
<s> and where was laon <\s>
<s> might my heart be dead while that far dearer heart could move and be <\s>
<s> or whilst over the earth the pall was spread which i had sworn to rend <\s>
<s> i might be free 3085 could i but win that friendly bird to me to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought by intercourse of mutual imagery of objects if such aid he could be taught but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought <\s>
<s> we live in our own world and mine was made from glorious fantasies of hope departed aye we are darkened with their floating shade or cast a lustre on them time imparted such power to me i became fearless hearted 3095 my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind and piercing like the morn now it has darted its lustre on all hidden things behind yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind <\s>
<s> my mind became the book through which i grew 3100 wise in all human wisdom and its cave which like a mine i rifled through and through to me the keeping of its secrets gave one mind the type of all the moveless wave whose calm reflects all moving things that are 3105 necessity and love and life the grave and sympathy fountains of hope and fear justice and truth and time and the world's natural sphere <\s>
<s> and on the sand would i make signs to range these woofs as they were woven of my thought 3110 clear elemental shapes whose smallest change a subtler language within language wrought the key of truths which once were dimly taught in old crotona and sweet melodies of love in that lorn solitude i caught 3115 from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize <\s>
<s> thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will as in a winged chariot o'er the plain of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill 3120 my heart with joy and there we sate again on the gray margin of the glimmering main happy as then but wiser far for we smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain fear faith and slavery and mankind was free 3125 equal and pure and wise in wisdom's prophecy <\s>
<s> for to my will my fancies were as slaves to do their sweet and subtile ministries and oft from that bright fountain's shadowy waves they would make human throngs gather and rise 3130 to combat with my overflowing eyes and voice made deep with passion thus i grew familiar with the shock and the surprise and war of earthly minds from which i drew the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew <\s>
<s> and thus my prison was the populous earth where i saw even as misery dreams of morn before the east has given its glory birth religion's pomp made desolate by the scorn of wisdom's faintest smile and thrones uptorn 3140 and dwellings of mild people interspersed with undivided fields of ripening corn and love made free a hope which we have nursed even with our blood and tears until its glory burst <\s>
<s> all is not lost <\s>
<s> there is some recompense 3145 for hope whose fountain can be thus profound even throned evil's splendid impotence girt by its hell of power the secret sound of hymns to truth and freedom the dread bound of life and death passed fearlessly and well 3150 dungeons wherein the high resolve is found racks which degraded woman's greatness tell and what may else be good and irresistible <\s>
<s> such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare in storm encompassed isles we cherish yet 3155 in this dark ruin such were mine even there as in its sleep some odorous violet while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet breathes in prophetic dreams of day's uprise or as ere scythian frost in fear has met 3160 spring's messengers descending from the skies the buds foreknow their life this hope must ever rise <\s>
<s> so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked with sound as if the world's wide continent 3165 had fallen in universal ruin wracked and through the cleft streamed in one cataract the stifling waters when i woke the flood whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked was ebbing round me and my bright abode 3170 before me yawned a chasm desert and bare and broad <\s>
<s> above me was the sky beneath the sea i stood upon a point of shattered stone and heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously with splash and shock into the deep anon 3175 all ceased and there was silence wide and lone <\s>
<s> i felt that i was free <\s>
<s> the ocean spray quivered beneath my feet the broad heaven shone around and in my hair the winds did play lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way <\s>
<s> my spirit moved upon the sea like wind which round some thymy cape will lag and hover though it can wake the still cloud and unbind the strength of tempest day was almost over when through the fading light i could discover 3185 a ship approaching its white sails were fed with the north wind its moving shade did cover the twilight deep the mariners in dread cast anchor when they saw new rocks around them spread <\s>
<s> and when they saw one sitting on a crag 3190 they sent a boat to me the sailors rowed in awe through many a new and fearful jag of overhanging rock through which there flowed the foam of streams that cannot make abode <\s>
<s> they came and questioned me but when they heard 3195 my voice they became silent and they stood and moved as men in whom new love had stirred deep thoughts so to the ship we passed without a word <\s>

<s> we passed the islets borne by wind and stream and as we sailed the mariners came near and thronged around to listen in the gleam of the pale moon i stood as one whom fear 3220 may not attaint and my calm voice did rear ye are all human yon broad moon gives light to millions who the selfsame likeness wear even while i speak beneath this very night their thoughts flow on like ours in sadness or delight <\s>
