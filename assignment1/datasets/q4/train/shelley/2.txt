<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>

<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>
<s> the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been <\s>
<s> i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him <\s>
<s> every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go <\s>
<s> in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty <\s>

<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>

<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>

<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>

<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>

<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>

<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>

<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>

<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>

<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>
<s> the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been <\s>
<s> i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him <\s>
<s> every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go <\s>
<s> in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty <\s>

<s> i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry <\s>
<s> this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth <\s>
<s> no account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary <\s>
<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>

<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>

<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>

<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>

<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>

<s> these being at last happily removed i hasten to fulfil an important duty that of giving the productions of a sublime genius to the world with all the correctness possible and of at the same time detailing the history of those productions as they sprang living and warm from his heart and brain <\s>
<s> i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry <\s>
<s> this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth <\s>
<s> no account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary <\s>
<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>
<s> the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy <\s>
<s> the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects <\s>
<s> his conversation was marked by its happy abundance and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions <\s>
<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>
<s> the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been <\s>

<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>
<s> the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy <\s>
<s> the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects <\s>

<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>
<s> perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted <\s>
<s> if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father <\s>
<s> the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes <\s>
<s> he died and the world showed no outward sign <\s>
<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
<s> his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved <\s>
<s> he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up <\s>
<s> he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love <\s>
<s> any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison <\s>
<s> it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him <\s>
<s> in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each <\s>
<s> the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been <\s>
<s> i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him <\s>
<s> every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go <\s>
<s> in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty <\s>

<s> postscript in second edition of 1839 <\s>
<s> in revising this new edition and carefully consulting shelley's scattered and confused papers i found a few fragments which had hitherto escaped me and was enabled to complete a few poems hitherto left unfinished <\s>
<s> what at one time escapes the searching eye dimmed by its own earnestness becomes clear at a future period <\s>
<s> by the aid of a friend i also present some poems complete and correct which hitherto have been defaced by various mistakes and omissions <\s>
<s> it was suggested that the poem to the queen of my heart was falsely attributed to shelley <\s>
<s> garnett proceeds the most important of the bodleian manuscripts is that of prometheus unbound which says mr <\s>
<s> locock has the appearance of being an intermediate draft and also the first copy made <\s>
<s> this should confer considerable authority on its variations from the accepted text as this appears to have been printed from a copy not made by shelley himself <\s>
<s> my prometheus he writes to ollier on september 6 1819 is now being transcribed an expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the copyist <\s>
<s> he wished the proofs to be sent to him in italy for correction but to this ollier objected and on may 14 1820 shelley signifies his acquiescence adding however in this case i shall repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press mr <\s>
<s> gisborne will revise it he heard it recited and will therefore more readily seize any error <\s>
<s> this confidence in the accuracy of gisborne's verbal memory is touching <\s>
<s> from a letter to gisborne on may 26 following it appears that the offer to correct came from him and that shelley sent him two little papers of corrections and additions which were probably made use of or the fact would have been made known <\s>
<s> in the case of additions this may satisfactorily account for apparent omissions in the bodleian manuscript <\s>
<s> gisborne after all did not prove fully up to the mark <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted writes shelley to ollier on november 20 that the errors of the press are so numerous adding i shall send you the list of errata in a day or two <\s>
<s> this was probably the list of errata written by shelley himself from which mrs <\s>
<s> shelley corrected the edition of 1839 in placing queen mab at the head of the juvenilia i have followed the arrangement adopted by mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman in his library edition of 1876 <\s>
<s> i have excluded the wandering jew having failed to satisfy myself of the sufficiency of the grounds on which in certain quarters it is accepted as the work of shelley <\s>
<s> the shorter fragments are printed as in professor dowden's edition of 1890 along with the miscellaneous poems of the years to which they severally belong under titles which are sometimes borrowed from mr <\s>
<s> buxton forman sometimes of my own choosing <\s>
<s> i have added a few brief editor's notes mainly on textual questions at the end of the book <\s>
<s> of the poverty of my work in this direction i am painfully aware but in the present edition the ordinary reader will it is hoped find an authentic complete and accurately printed text and if this be so the principal end and aim of the oxford shelley will have been attained <\s>

<s> in a valuable paper notes on passages in shelley contributed to the modern language review october 1905 mr <\s>
<s> bradley discussed amongst other things some fifty places in the text of shelley's verse and indicated certain errors and omissions in this edition <\s>
<s> with the aid of these notes the editor has now carefully revised the text and has in many places adopted the suggestions or conclusions of their accomplished author <\s>
<s> shelley to first collected edition 1839 <\s>
<s> obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with a perfect edition of shelley's poems <\s>
<s> these being at last happily removed i hasten to fulfil an important duty that of giving the productions of a sublime genius to the world with all the correctness possible and of at the same time detailing the history of those productions as they sprang living and warm from his heart and brain <\s>
<s> i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry <\s>
<s> this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth <\s>
<s> no account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary <\s>
<s> whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine <\s>
<s> the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy <\s>
<s> the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects <\s>
<s> his conversation was marked by its happy abundance and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions <\s>
<s> to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart <\s>
<s> he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any new sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage <\s>
<s> those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed <\s>
<s> he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered <\s>
<s> many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties <\s>
<s> he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism <\s>
<s> these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry <\s>
<s> the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim <\s>
<s> in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart <\s>
<s> among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life <\s>
<s> in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception <\s>
<s> the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects <\s>
<s> shelley's conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse <\s>
<s> yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him <\s>
<s> others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them <\s>
<s> there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions <\s>
<s> they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames <\s>
<s> no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration <\s>
<s> his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations <\s>
<s> such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy <\s>
<s> his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle <\s>
<s> he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few <\s>
<s> we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind <\s>
<s> in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible <\s>
<s> this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study <\s>
<s> he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato's praise of love translated by shelley <\s>
<s> to return to his own poetry <\s>
<s> the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate <\s>
<s> the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached <\s>
<s> there is much however that speaks to the many <\s>
<s> when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul <\s>
<s> a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so <\s>
<s> it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge <\s>
<s> it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died <\s>
<s> the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth <\s>
<s> through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations <\s>

<s> but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles <\s>
