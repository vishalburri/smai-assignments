<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>

<s> cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying man's brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee 5 more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah <\s>
<s> poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate 10 till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair 15 crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late <\s>
<s> twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind 20 i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined 25 she bedewed it with tears then she hung o'er the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind <\s>
<s> go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling 30 my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a storm blasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew <\s>

<s> tis thus the world's keenness hath torn 5 some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me 10 its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee <\s>
<s> the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon 15 all bid you a tender adieu then harriet <\s>
<s> dearest farewell you and i love may ne'er meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain 20 april 1810 <\s>
<s> ask not the pallid stranger's woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets 5 nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance <\s>

<s> when torn is dear affection's tie 25 sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow <\s>
<s> to me this world's a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view 5 showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah <\s>
<s> little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour 10 i danced in pleasure's fading ray fading alas <\s>
<s> nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song 15 nor think how short their time to live <\s>
<s> the heart that bears deep sorrow's trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll 20 the sunken cheek the humid eyes e'en better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memory's rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh 25 a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play <\s>
<s> thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view 30 when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu <\s>
<s> and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale misery's shrine seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow 5 that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountain's craggy brow <\s>
