<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>
<s> maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelley's boat <\s>

<s> she does indeed excite my surprise and admiration <\s>

<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>
<s> when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>

<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>

<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>

<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>

<s> this morn thy gallant bark sailed on a sunny sea tis noon and tempests dark have wrecked it on the lee <\s>
<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>
<s> thou sleep'st upon the shore beside the knelling surge and sea nymphs evermore shall sadly chant thy dirge <\s>
<s> they come they come the spirits of the deep while near thy seaweed pillow my lonely watch i keep <\s>
<s> from far across the sea i hear a loud lament by echo's voice for thee from ocean's caverns sent <\s>
<s> the spirits of the deep <\s>
<s> they raise a wail of sorrow while i forever weep <\s>
<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>
<s> days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes <\s>
<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>
<s> maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelley's boat <\s>
<s> she had left genoa on thursday last but had been driven back by the prevailing bad winds <\s>
<s> heslop and two english seamen brought her round and they speak most highly of her performances <\s>
<s> she does indeed excite my surprise and admiration <\s>
<s> shelley and i walked to lerici and made a stretch off the land to try her and i find she fetches whatever she looks at <\s>
<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>
<s> when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him <\s>
<s> the heats set in in the middle of june the days became excessively hot <\s>
<s> but the sea breeze cooled the air at noon and extreme heat always put shelley in spirits <\s>
<s> a long drought had preceded the heat and prayers for rain were being put up in the churches and processions of relics for the same effect took place in every town <\s>
<s> at this time we received letters announcing the arrival of leigh hunt at genoa <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>

<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>

<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>

<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>
<s> maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelley's boat <\s>

<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>
<s> when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>
<s> days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes <\s>
<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>

<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>
<s> days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes <\s>
<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>
<s> maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelley's boat <\s>

<s> heslop and two english seamen brought her round and they speak most highly of her performances <\s>
<s> she does indeed excite my surprise and admiration <\s>
<s> shelley and i walked to lerici and made a stretch off the land to try her and i find she fetches whatever she looks at <\s>
<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>
<s> when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him <\s>
<s> the heats set in in the middle of june the days became excessively hot <\s>
<s> but the sea breeze cooled the air at noon and extreme heat always put shelley in spirits <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>

<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>
<s> maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelley's boat <\s>

<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>
<s> days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes <\s>
<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>

<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>

<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>

<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>

<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>

<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>

<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>

<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>

<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>

<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>

<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>

<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>

<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>

<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>

<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>

<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>

<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>

<s> in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summer it was thus that short sighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask <\s>
<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>
<s> shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa <\s>
<s> they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger <\s>
<s> when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>
<s> i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy <\s>
<s> in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us <\s>
<s> only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all <\s>
<s> it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal <\s>
<s> we left pisa on the 26th of april <\s>
<s> the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one <\s>
<s> the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo <\s>
<s> our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind <\s>
<s> the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin <\s>
<s> he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees <\s>
<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>
<s> the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty <\s>
<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>
<s> the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship <\s>
<s> at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever varying tints <\s>
<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
<s> our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among <\s>
<s> many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus <\s>
<s> we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient <\s>
<s> had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves <\s>
<s> yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively <\s>
<s> at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience <\s>
<s> on monday 12th may it came <\s>
<s> williams records the long wished for fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather <\s>

<s> the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing <\s>

<s> by spirits of the deep thou'rt cradled on the billow to thy eternal sleep <\s>

<s> with this last year of the life of shelley these notes end <\s>
<s> they are not what i intended them to be <\s>
<s> i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task <\s>
<s> recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health <\s>

<s> i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelley's writings <\s>
<s> i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error <\s>
<s> some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect <\s>
<s> did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning <\s>
<s> yet i believe no mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather <\s>
<s> spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty <\s>
<s> shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i <\s>
<s> it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion <\s>
<s> he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play <\s>
<s> whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last <\s>
<s> his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors <\s>
<s> his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley's taste <\s>
<s> it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the sea coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best <\s>
<s> captain roberts r n undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron <\s>
<s> ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards <\s>

<s> these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness <\s>

<s> the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosa's landscapes only <\s>
<s> sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged the ponente the wind was called on that shore <\s>

<s> the natives were wilder than the place <\s>
