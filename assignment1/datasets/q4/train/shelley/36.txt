<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> he had bought one of the sporades he was accompanied by a lady who might have been supposed to be his wife an effeminate looking youth to whom he shewed an attachment so singular excessive an attachment as to give rise to the suspicion that she was a woman at his death this suspicion was confirmed ... object speedily found a refuge both from the taunts of the brute multitude and from the ... of her grief in the same grave that contained her lover he had bought one of the sporades fitted up a saracenic castle which accident had preserved in some repair with simple elegance it was his intention to dedicate the remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions these verses apparently were intended as a dedication of a longer poem or series of poems preface 3 <\s>
<s> a cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure <\s>

<s> an antelope 75 in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june 80 amid the splendour winged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honey dew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops 85 of planetary music heard in trance <\s>
<s> in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soul too deep for the brief fathom line of thought or sense <\s>
<s> 90 the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence 95 whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snow like air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver 100 continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness <\s>
<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>
<s> a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity 115 a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions life's dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning 120 a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morn's and from her presence life was radiated 325 through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like light all other sounds were penetrated 330 by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun 335 when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beauty's glow 340 i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many years that it was emily <\s>
<s> twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth 345 this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide 350 to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbow winged showers and as those married lights which from the towers 355 of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their many mingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway 360 govern my sphere of being night and day <\s>
<s> thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumn's sere maturity 365 light it into the winter of the tomb where it may ripen to a brighter bloom <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>
<s> the day is come and thou wilt fly with me <\s>
<s> to whatsoe'er of dull mortality is mine remain a vestal sister still 390 to the intense the deep the imperishable not mine but me henceforth be thou united even as a bride delighting and delighted <\s>
<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>
<s> emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow there is a path on the sea's azure floor 410 no keel has ever ploughed that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart's sister wilt thou sail with me <\s>
<s> 415 our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea 420 treading each other's heels unheededly <\s>
<s> it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude 425 but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold <\s>
<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>
<s> and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep 450 and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain <\s>
<s> and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul they seem 455 like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washed by the soft blue oceans of young air <\s>
<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>
<s> our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound 565 and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be 570 confused in passion's golden purity as mountain springs under the morning sun <\s>
<s> we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh <\s>
<s> one passion in twin hearts which grows and grew 575 till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigured ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another's substance finding food 580 like flames too pure and light and unimbued to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death 585 one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation <\s>
<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>
<s> weak verses go kneel at your sovereign's feet and say we are the masters of thy slave what wouldest thou with us and ours and thine <\s>
<s> then call your sisters from oblivion's cave 595 all singing loud love's very pain is sweet but its reward is in the world divine which if not here it builds beyond the grave <\s>
<s> so shall ye live when i am there <\s>
<s> then haste over the hearts of men until ye meet 600 marina vanna primus and the rest and bid them love each other and be blessed and leave the troop which errs and which reproves and come and be my guest for i am love's <\s>

<s> mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness 175 the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>
<s> why not true to me <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>

<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>

<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>

<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>

<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>

<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> he had bought one of the sporades he was accompanied by a lady who might have been supposed to be his wife an effeminate looking youth to whom he shewed an attachment so singular excessive an attachment as to give rise to the suspicion that she was a woman at his death this suspicion was confirmed ... object speedily found a refuge both from the taunts of the brute multitude and from the ... of her grief in the same grave that contained her lover he had bought one of the sporades fitted up a saracenic castle which accident had preserved in some repair with simple elegance it was his intention to dedicate the remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions these verses apparently were intended as a dedication of a longer poem or series of poems preface 3 <\s>
<s> a cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure <\s>

<s> an antelope 75 in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june 80 amid the splendour winged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honey dew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops 85 of planetary music heard in trance <\s>
<s> in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soul too deep for the brief fathom line of thought or sense <\s>
<s> 90 the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence 95 whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snow like air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver 100 continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness <\s>
<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>
<s> a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity 115 a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions life's dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning 120 a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morn's and from her presence life was radiated 325 through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like light all other sounds were penetrated 330 by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun 335 when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beauty's glow 340 i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many years that it was emily <\s>
<s> twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth 345 this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide 350 to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbow winged showers and as those married lights which from the towers 355 of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their many mingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway 360 govern my sphere of being night and day <\s>
<s> thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumn's sere maturity 365 light it into the winter of the tomb where it may ripen to a brighter bloom <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>
<s> the day is come and thou wilt fly with me <\s>
<s> to whatsoe'er of dull mortality is mine remain a vestal sister still 390 to the intense the deep the imperishable not mine but me henceforth be thou united even as a bride delighting and delighted <\s>
<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>
<s> emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow there is a path on the sea's azure floor 410 no keel has ever ploughed that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart's sister wilt thou sail with me <\s>
<s> 415 our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea 420 treading each other's heels unheededly <\s>
<s> it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude 425 but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold <\s>
<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>
<s> and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep 450 and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain <\s>
<s> and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul they seem 455 like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washed by the soft blue oceans of young air <\s>
<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>
<s> our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound 565 and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be 570 confused in passion's golden purity as mountain springs under the morning sun <\s>
<s> we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh <\s>
<s> one passion in twin hearts which grows and grew 575 till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigured ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another's substance finding food 580 like flames too pure and light and unimbued to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death 585 one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation <\s>
<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>
<s> weak verses go kneel at your sovereign's feet and say we are the masters of thy slave what wouldest thou with us and ours and thine <\s>
<s> then call your sisters from oblivion's cave 595 all singing loud love's very pain is sweet but its reward is in the world divine which if not here it builds beyond the grave <\s>
<s> so shall ye live when i am there <\s>
<s> then haste over the hearts of men until ye meet 600 marina vanna primus and the rest and bid them love each other and be blessed and leave the troop which errs and which reproves and come and be my guest for i am love's <\s>

<s> mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness 175 the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>
<s> why not true to me <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>

<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>

<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>

<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>

<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>

<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> he had bought one of the sporades he was accompanied by a lady who might have been supposed to be his wife an effeminate looking youth to whom he shewed an attachment so singular excessive an attachment as to give rise to the suspicion that she was a woman at his death this suspicion was confirmed ... object speedily found a refuge both from the taunts of the brute multitude and from the ... of her grief in the same grave that contained her lover he had bought one of the sporades fitted up a saracenic castle which accident had preserved in some repair with simple elegance it was his intention to dedicate the remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions these verses apparently were intended as a dedication of a longer poem or series of poems preface 3 <\s>
<s> a cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure <\s>

<s> an antelope 75 in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june 80 amid the splendour winged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honey dew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops 85 of planetary music heard in trance <\s>
<s> in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soul too deep for the brief fathom line of thought or sense <\s>
<s> 90 the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence 95 whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snow like air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver 100 continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness <\s>
<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>
<s> a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity 115 a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions life's dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning 120 a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morn's and from her presence life was radiated 325 through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like light all other sounds were penetrated 330 by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun 335 when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beauty's glow 340 i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many years that it was emily <\s>
<s> twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth 345 this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide 350 to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbow winged showers and as those married lights which from the towers 355 of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their many mingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway 360 govern my sphere of being night and day <\s>
<s> thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumn's sere maturity 365 light it into the winter of the tomb where it may ripen to a brighter bloom <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>
<s> the day is come and thou wilt fly with me <\s>
<s> to whatsoe'er of dull mortality is mine remain a vestal sister still 390 to the intense the deep the imperishable not mine but me henceforth be thou united even as a bride delighting and delighted <\s>
<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>
<s> emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow there is a path on the sea's azure floor 410 no keel has ever ploughed that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart's sister wilt thou sail with me <\s>
<s> 415 our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea 420 treading each other's heels unheededly <\s>
<s> it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude 425 but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold <\s>
<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>
<s> and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep 450 and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain <\s>
<s> and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul they seem 455 like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washed by the soft blue oceans of young air <\s>
<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>
<s> our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound 565 and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be 570 confused in passion's golden purity as mountain springs under the morning sun <\s>
<s> we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh <\s>
<s> one passion in twin hearts which grows and grew 575 till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigured ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another's substance finding food 580 like flames too pure and light and unimbued to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death 585 one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation <\s>
<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>
<s> weak verses go kneel at your sovereign's feet and say we are the masters of thy slave what wouldest thou with us and ours and thine <\s>
<s> then call your sisters from oblivion's cave 595 all singing loud love's very pain is sweet but its reward is in the world divine which if not here it builds beyond the grave <\s>
<s> so shall ye live when i am there <\s>
<s> then haste over the hearts of men until ye meet 600 marina vanna primus and the rest and bid them love each other and be blessed and leave the troop which errs and which reproves and come and be my guest for i am love's <\s>

<s> mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness 175 the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>
<s> why not true to me <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>

<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>

<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>

<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>

<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>

<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>

<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>

<s> he had bought one of the sporades he was accompanied by a lady who might have been supposed to be his wife an effeminate looking youth to whom he shewed an attachment so singular excessive an attachment as to give rise to the suspicion that she was a woman at his death this suspicion was confirmed ... object speedily found a refuge both from the taunts of the brute multitude and from the ... of her grief in the same grave that contained her lover he had bought one of the sporades fitted up a saracenic castle which accident had preserved in some repair with simple elegance it was his intention to dedicate the remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions these verses apparently were intended as a dedication of a longer poem or series of poems preface 3 <\s>
<s> a cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure <\s>

<s> an antelope 75 in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june 80 amid the splendour winged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honey dew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops 85 of planetary music heard in trance <\s>
<s> in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soul too deep for the brief fathom line of thought or sense <\s>
<s> 90 the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence 95 whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snow like air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver 100 continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness <\s>
<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>
<s> a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity 115 a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions life's dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning 120 a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave <\s>

<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morn's and from her presence life was radiated 325 through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like light all other sounds were penetrated 330 by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun 335 when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beauty's glow 340 i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many years that it was emily <\s>
<s> twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth 345 this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide 350 to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbow winged showers and as those married lights which from the towers 355 of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their many mingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway 360 govern my sphere of being night and day <\s>
<s> thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumn's sere maturity 365 light it into the winter of the tomb where it may ripen to a brighter bloom <\s>

<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>
<s> the day is come and thou wilt fly with me <\s>
<s> to whatsoe'er of dull mortality is mine remain a vestal sister still 390 to the intense the deep the imperishable not mine but me henceforth be thou united even as a bride delighting and delighted <\s>
<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>
<s> emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow there is a path on the sea's azure floor 410 no keel has ever ploughed that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart's sister wilt thou sail with me <\s>
<s> 415 our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea 420 treading each other's heels unheededly <\s>
<s> it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude 425 but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold <\s>
<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>
<s> and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep 450 and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain <\s>
<s> and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul they seem 455 like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washed by the soft blue oceans of young air <\s>
<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>
<s> our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound 565 and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be 570 confused in passion's golden purity as mountain springs under the morning sun <\s>
<s> we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh <\s>
<s> one passion in twin hearts which grows and grew 575 till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigured ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another's substance finding food 580 like flames too pure and light and unimbued to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death 585 one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation <\s>
<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>
<s> weak verses go kneel at your sovereign's feet and say we are the masters of thy slave what wouldest thou with us and ours and thine <\s>
<s> then call your sisters from oblivion's cave 595 all singing loud love's very pain is sweet but its reward is in the world divine which if not here it builds beyond the grave <\s>
<s> so shall ye live when i am there <\s>
<s> then haste over the hearts of men until ye meet 600 marina vanna primus and the rest and bid them love each other and be blessed and leave the troop which errs and which reproves and come and be my guest for i am love's <\s>

<s> mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness 175 the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure <\s>

<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>
<s> why not true to me <\s>

<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>

<s> a cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure <\s>
<s> a violet shrouded grave of woe i measure the world of fancies seeking one like thee 70 and find alas <\s>
<s> she met me stranger upon life's rough way and lured me towards sweet death as night by day winter by spring or sorrow by swift hope led into light life peace <\s>
<s> an antelope 75 in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june 80 amid the splendour winged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honey dew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops 85 of planetary music heard in trance <\s>
<s> in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soul too deep for the brief fathom line of thought or sense <\s>
<s> 90 the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence 95 whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snow like air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver 100 continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness <\s>
<s> warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress 105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt 110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands <\s>
<s> a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity 115 a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions life's dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning 120 a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave <\s>
<s> ah woe is me <\s>
<s> what have i dared <\s>
<s> where am i lifted <\s>
<s> how shall i descend and perish not <\s>
<s> i know 125 that love makes all things equal i have heard by mine own heart this joyous truth averred the spirit of the worm beneath the sod in love and worship blends itself with god <\s>
<s> pilot of the fate 130 whose course has been so starless <\s>
<s> o too late beloved <\s>
<s> o too soon adored by me <\s>
<s> for in the fields of immortality my spirit should at first have worshipped thine a divine presence in a place divine 135 or should have moved beside it on this earth a shadow of that substance from its birth but not as now i love thee yes i feel that on the fountain of my heart a seal is set to keep its waters pure and bright 140 for thee since in those tears thou hast delight <\s>
<s> we are we not formed as notes of music are for one another though dissimilar such difference without discord as can make those sweetest sounds in which all spirits shake 145 as trembling leaves in a continuous air <\s>
<s> thy wisdom speaks in me and bids me dare beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked <\s>
<s> i never was attached to that great sect whose doctrine is that each one should select 150 out of the crowd a mistress or a friend and all the rest though fair and wise commend to cold oblivion though it is in the code of modern morals and the beaten road which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread 155 who travel to their home among the dead by the broad highway of the world and so with one chained friend perhaps a jealous foe the dreariest and the longest journey go <\s>
<s> true love in this differs from gold and clay 160 that to divide is not to take away <\s>
<s> love is like understanding that grows bright gazing on many truths tis like thy light imagination <\s>
<s> which from earth and sky and from the depths of human fantasy 165 as from a thousand prisms and mirrors fills the universe with glorious beams and kills error the worm with many a sun like arrow of its reverberated lightning <\s>
<s> narrow the heart that loves the brain that contemplates 170 the life that wears the spirit that creates one object and one form and builds thereby a sepulchre for its eternity <\s>
<s> mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness 175 the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure <\s>
<s> if you divide suffering and dross you may diminish till it is consumed away if you divide pleasure and love and thought 180 each part exceeds the whole and we know not how much while any yet remains unshared of pleasure may be gained of sorrow spared this truth is that deep well whence sages draw the unenvied light of hope the eternal law 185 by which those live to whom this world of life is as a garden ravaged and whose strife tills for the promise of a later birth the wilderness of this elysian earth <\s>
<s> there was a being whom my spirit oft 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the air like waves 195 of wonder level dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not <\s>
<s> in solitudes 200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air 205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summer birds and from all sounds all silence <\s>
<s> in the words of antique verse and high romance in form 210 sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom 215 her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight 220 is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light when it would seek in hesper's setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame 225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our life's shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between 230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest <\s>
<s> then i 'where the world's echo answered where <\s>
<s> and in that silence and in my despair 235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate 240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her 245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectation's breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife 250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me <\s>
<s> 255 there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came 260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honey dew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray o'er a young brow they hid its unblown prime 265 with ruins of unseasonable time <\s>
<s> in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought <\s>
<s> and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray 270 and one was true oh <\s>
<s> why not true to me <\s>
<s> then as a hunted deer that could not flee i turned upon my thoughts and stood at bay wounded and weak and panting the cold day trembled for pity of my strife and pain <\s>
<s> 275 when like a noonday dawn there shone again deliverance <\s>
<s> one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heaven's bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines <\s>
<s> young and fair 285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind 290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning o'er endymion <\s>
<s> and i was laid asleep spirit and limb 295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moon's image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead 300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew 305 and cried away he is not of our crew <\s>
<s> i wept and though it be a dream i weep <\s>
<s> what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse 310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept o'er those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell 315 into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears <\s>
<s> weep not for me <\s>
<s> 320 at length into the obscure forest came the vision i had sought through grief and shame <\s>
<s> athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morn's and from her presence life was radiated 325 through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like light all other sounds were penetrated 330 by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun 335 when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beauty's glow 340 i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many years that it was emily <\s>
<s> twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth 345 this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide 350 to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbow winged showers and as those married lights which from the towers 355 of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their many mingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway 360 govern my sphere of being night and day <\s>
<s> thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumn's sere maturity 365 light it into the winter of the tomb where it may ripen to a brighter bloom <\s>
<s> thou too o comet beautiful and fierce who drew the heart of this frail universe towards thine own till wrecked in that convulsion 370 alternating attraction and repulsion thine went astray and that was rent in twain oh float into our azure heaven again <\s>
<s> be there love's folding star at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn 375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild 380 called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar <\s>
<s> lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth 385 whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise <\s>
<s> the day is come and thou wilt fly with me <\s>
<s> to whatsoe'er of dull mortality is mine remain a vestal sister still 390 to the intense the deep the imperishable not mine but me henceforth be thou united even as a bride delighting and delighted <\s>
<s> the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison <\s>
<s> 395 the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heaven's free breath 400 which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free 405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos <\s>
<s> emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow there is a path on the sea's azure floor 410 no keel has ever ploughed that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart's sister wilt thou sail with me <\s>
<s> 415 our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea 420 treading each other's heels unheededly <\s>
<s> it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude 425 but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold <\s>
<s> the blue aegean girds this chosen home 430 with ever changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide 435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year 440 pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs 445 the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers <\s>
<s> and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep 450 and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain <\s>
<s> and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul they seem 455 like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washed by the soft blue oceans of young air <\s>
<s> 460 it is a favoured place <\s>
<s> famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunder psalm 465 to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality <\s>
<s> and from the sea there rise and from the sky 470 there fall clear exhalations soft and bright <\s>
<s> veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness 475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen 480 o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island people know 485 tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean king ere crime had been invented in the world's young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time 490 an envy of the isles a pleasure house made sacred to his sister and his spouse <\s>
<s> it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown 495 out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wild vine interknit 500 the volumes of their many twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen 505 or fragments of the day's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors <\s>
<s> and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another's arms and dream 510 of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality <\s>
<s> this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there 515 looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call 520 the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity <\s>
<s> our simple life wants little and true taste 525 hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill <\s>
<s> the ring dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love lament and the owls flit 530 round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep <\s>
<s> 535 be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one <\s>
<s> meanwhile 540 we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour 545 or linger where the pebble paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss 550 and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep 555 a veil for our seclusion close as night's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again <\s>
<s> and we will talk until thought's melody 560 become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound <\s>
<s> our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound 565 and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be 570 confused in passion's golden purity as mountain springs under the morning sun <\s>
<s> we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh <\s>
<s> one passion in twin hearts which grows and grew 575 till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigured ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another's substance finding food 580 like flames too pure and light and unimbued to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death 585 one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation <\s>
<s> the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire 590 i pant i sink i tremble i expire <\s>
<s> weak verses go kneel at your sovereign's feet and say we are the masters of thy slave what wouldest thou with us and ours and thine <\s>
<s> then call your sisters from oblivion's cave 595 all singing loud love's very pain is sweet but its reward is in the world divine which if not here it builds beyond the grave <\s>
<s> so shall ye live when i am there <\s>
