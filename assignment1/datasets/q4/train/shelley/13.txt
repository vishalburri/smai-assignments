<s> and so his mind was healed while mine grew sick with fear for ever now his health declined like some frail bark which cannot bear 815 the impulse of an altered wind though prosperous and my heart grew full mid its new joy of a new care for his cheek became not pale but fair as rose o'ershadowed lilies are 820 and soon his deep and sunny hair in this alone less beautiful like grass in tombs grew wild and rare <\s>
<s> the blood in his translucent veins beat not like animal life but love 825 seemed now its sullen springs to move when life had failed and all its pains and sudden sleep would seize him oft like death so calm but that a tear his pointed eyelashes between 830 would gather in the light serene of smiles whose lustre bright and soft beneath lay undulating there <\s>
<s> his breath was like inconstant flame as eagerly it went and came 835 and i hung o'er him in his sleep till like an image in the lake which rains disturb my tears would break the shadow of that slumber deep then he would bid me not to weep 840 and say with flattery false yet sweet that death and he could never meet if i would never part with him <\s>
<s> and so we loved and did unite all that in us was yet divided 845 for when he said that many a rite by men to bind but once provided could not be shared by him and me or they would kill him in their glee i shuddered and then laughing said 850 we will have rites our faith to bind but our church shall be the starry night our altar the grassy earth outspread and our priest the muttering wind <\s>
<s> twas sunset as i spoke one star 855 had scarce burst forth when from afar the ministers of misrule sent seized upon lionel and bore his chained limbs to a dreary tower in the midst of a city vast and wide <\s>

<s> i dwelt beside the prison gate and the strange crowd that out and in passed some no doubt with mine own fate might have fretted me with its ceaseless din 905 but the fever of care was louder within <\s>

<s> many had never wept before 915 from whom fast tears then gushed and fell many will relent no more who sobbed like infants then aye all who thronged the prison's stony hall the rulers or the slaves of law 920 felt with a new surprise and awe that they were human till strong shame made them again become the same <\s>
<s> the prison blood hounds huge and grim from human looks the infection caught 925 and fondly crouched and fawned on him and men have heard the prisoners say who in their rotting dungeons lay that from that hour throughout one day the fierce despair and hate which kept 930 their trampled bosoms almost slept where like twin vultures they hung feeding on each heart's wound wide torn and bleeding because their jailors rule they thought grew merciful like a parent's sway <\s>
<s> 935 i know not how but we were free and lionel sate alone with me as the carriage drove thro the streets apace and we looked upon each other's face and the blood in our fingers intertwined 940 ran like the thoughts of a single mind as the swift emotions went and came thro the veins of each united frame <\s>
<s> so thro the long long streets we passed of the million peopled city vast 945 which is that desert where each one seeks his mate yet is alone beloved and sought and mourned of none until the clear blue sky was seen and the grassy meadows bright and green 950 and then i sunk in his embrace enclosing there a mighty space of love and so we travelled on by woods and fields of yellow flowers and towns and villages and towers 955 day after day of happy hours <\s>
<s> it was the azure time of june when the skies are deep in the stainless noon and the warm and fitful breezes shake the fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar 960 and there were odours then to make the very breath we did respire a liquid element whereon our spirits like delighted things that walk the air on subtle wings 965 floated and mingled far away mid the warm winds of the sunny day <\s>
<s> and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth 970 like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earth's breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close 975 their languid leaves when daylight's gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth 980 in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears 985 a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea 990 which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed o'er <\s>
<s> the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully 995 and the old man's sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed o'er me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day 1000 he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he is o how beautiful <\s>
<s> 1005 yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which ne'er was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the rose like hues which flow 1010 from sunset o'er the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life o'er every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought <\s>
<s> when the summer wind faint odours brought 1015 from mountain flowers even as it passed his cheek would change as the noonday sea which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully <\s>
<s> if but a cloud the sky o'ercast you might see his colour come and go 1020 and the softest strain of music made sweet smiles yet sad arise and fade amid the dew of his tender eyes and the breath with intermitting flow made his pale lips quiver and part <\s>
<s> 1025 you might hear the beatings of his heart quick but not strong and with my tresses when oft he playfully would bind in the bowers of mossy lonelinesses his neck and win me so to mingle 1030 in the sweet depth of woven caresses and our faint limbs were intertwined alas <\s>
<s> the unquiet life did tingle from mine own heart through every vein like a captive in dreams of liberty 1035 who beats the walls of his stony cell <\s>
<s> but his it seemed already free like the shadow of fire surrounding me <\s>
<s> on my faint eyes and limbs did dwell that spirit as it passed till soon 1040 as a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon beneath its light invisible is seen when it folds its gray wings again to alight on midnight's dusky plain i lived and saw and the gathering soul 1045 passed from beneath that strong control and i fell on a life which was sick with fear of all the woe that now i bear <\s>
<s> amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and sea girt promontory 1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and o'er the gate was sculptured to fidelity 1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery <\s>
<s> 1060 the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its side convulsing heart <\s>
<s> 1065 an unskilled hand yet one informed with genius had the marble warmed with that pathetic life <\s>
<s> this tale it told a dog had from the sea when the tide was raging fearfully 1070 dragged lionel's mother weak and pale then died beside her on the sand and she that temple thence had planned but it was lionel's own hand had wrought the image <\s>
<s> each new moon 1075 that lady did in this lone fane the rites of a religion sweet whose god was in her heart and brain the seasons loveliest flowers were strewn on the marble floor beneath her feet 1080 and she brought crowns of sea buds white whose odour is so sweet and faint and weeds like branching chrysolite woven in devices fine and quaint <\s>
<s> and tears from her brown eyes did stain 1085 the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence 1090 from the hissing frankincense whose smoke wool white as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright 1095 o'er the split cedar's pointed flame and the lady's harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers 1100 and as they listened round shed tears <\s>
<s> one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud 1105 climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy 1110 then failing soothes the air again <\s>
<s> we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mother's harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft 1115 amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaven taught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poet bird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song <\s>
<s> 1120 heardst thou not sweet words among that heaven resounding minstrelsy <\s>
<s> heard'st thou not that those who die awake in a world of ecstasy <\s>
<s> that love when limbs are interwoven 1125 and sleep when the night of life is cloven and thought to the world's dim boundaries clinging and music when one beloved is singing is death <\s>
<s> let us drain right joyously the cup which the sweet bird fills for me <\s>
<s> 1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine 1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken 1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came 1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood 1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance 1155 of spirit piercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwind rifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined <\s>
<s> i paused but soon his gestures kindled 1160 new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung 1165 circles of life dissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly 1170 and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away 1175 in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love <\s>
<s> i said no word no look no motion <\s>
<s> yes 1180 there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moment's hope be told <\s>
<s> i looked and knew that he was dead and fell as the eagle on the plain falls when life deserts her brain 1185 and the mortal lightning is veiled again <\s>
<s> o that i were now dead <\s>
<s> but such did they not love demand too much those dying murmurs he forbade <\s>
<s> o that i once again were mad <\s>
<s> 1190 and yet dear rosalind not so for i would live to share thy woe <\s>
<s> did i forget thee too <\s>
<s> alas we know not what we do when we speak words <\s>
<s> no memory more 1195 is in my mind of that sea shore <\s>
<s> madness came on me and a troop of misty shapes did seem to sit beside me on a vessel's poop and the clear north wind was driving it <\s>
<s> 1200 then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me 1205 drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find 1210 that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before <\s>
<s> nor less 1215 wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept 1220 no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child <\s>
<s> tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change 1225 as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe <\s>
<s> that lionel great wealth had left by will to me and that of all the ready lies of law bereft 1230 my child and me might well befall <\s>
<s> but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my child's beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate 1235 the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame <\s>
<s> she ceased lo where red morning thro the woods 1240 is burning o'er the dew said rosalind <\s>
<s> and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore 1245 is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers 1250 scatters its sense dissolving fragrance o'er the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forest's limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helen's home and clean and white 1255 like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude its casements bright shone through their vine leaves in the morning sun and even within twas scarce like italy <\s>
<s> and when she saw how all things there were planned 1260 as in an english home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionel's 1265 those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it <\s>

<s> amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and sea girt promontory 1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and o'er the gate was sculptured to fidelity 1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery <\s>

<s> 1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine 1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken 1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came 1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood 1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance 1155 of spirit piercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwind rifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined <\s>

<s> i said no word no look no motion <\s>
<s> yes 1180 there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moment's hope be told <\s>

<s> 1200 then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me 1205 drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find 1210 that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before <\s>
<s> nor less 1215 wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept 1220 no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child <\s>
<s> tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change 1225 as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe <\s>

<s> but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my child's beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate 1235 the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame <\s>
<s> she ceased lo where red morning thro the woods 1240 is burning o'er the dew said rosalind <\s>
<s> and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore 1245 is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers 1250 scatters its sense dissolving fragrance o'er the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forest's limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helen's home and clean and white 1255 like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude its casements bright shone through their vine leaves in the morning sun and even within twas scarce like italy <\s>
<s> and when she saw how all things there were planned 1260 as in an english home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionel's 1265 those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it <\s>
<s> rosalind weep not at thine own words though they must make me weep <\s>
<s> what is thy tale <\s>
<s> helen i fear twill shake thy gentle heart with tears <\s>
<s> thou well rememberest when we met no more 595 and though i dwelt with lionel that friendless caution pierced me sore with grief a wound my spirit bore indignantly but when he died with him lay dead both hope and pride <\s>
<s> all hope is buried now <\s>
<s> but then men dreamed the aged earth was labouring in that mighty birth which many a poet and a sage has aye foreseen the happy age 605 when truth and love shall dwell below among the works and ways of men which on this world not power but will even now is wanting to fulfil <\s>
<s> among mankind what thence befell 610 of strife how vain is known too well when liberty's dear paean fell mid murderous howls <\s>
<s> to lionel though of great wealth and lineage high yet through those dungeon walls there came 615 thy thrilling light o liberty <\s>
<s> and as the meteor's midnight flame startles the dreamer sun like truth flashed on his visionary youth and filled him not with love but faith 620 and hope and courage mute in death for love and life in him were twins born at one birth in every other first life then love its course begins though they be children of one mother 625 and so through this dark world they fleet divided till in death they meet but he loved all things ever <\s>
<s> then he passed amid the strife of men and stood at the throne of armed power 630 pleading for a world of woe secure as one on a rock built tower o'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro mid the passions wild of human kind he stood like a spirit calming them 635 for it was said his words could bind like music the lulled crowd and stem that torrent of unquiet dream which mortals truth and reason deem but is revenge and fear and pride <\s>
<s> 640 joyous he was and hope and peace on all who heard him did abide raining like dew from his sweet talk as where the evening star may walk along the brink of the gloomy seas 645 liquid mists of splendour quiver <\s>
<s> his very gestures touched to tears the unpersuaded tyrant never so moved before his presence stung the torturers with their victim's pain 650 and none knew how and through their ears the subtle witchcraft of his tongue unlocked the hearts of those who keep gold the world's bond of slavery <\s>
<s> men wondered and some sneered to see 655 one sow what he could never reap for he is rich they said and young and might drink from the depths of luxury <\s>
<s> if he seeks fame fame never crowned the champion of a trampled creed 660 if he seeks power power is enthroned mid ancient rights and wrongs to feed which hungry wolves with praise and spoil those who would sit near power must toil and such there sitting all may see <\s>
<s> 665 what seeks he <\s>
<s> all that others seek he casts away like a vile weed which the sea casts unreturningly <\s>
<s> that poor and hungry men should break the laws which wreak them toil and scorn 670 we understand but lionel we know is rich and nobly born <\s>
<s> so wondered they yet all men loved young lionel though few approved all but the priests whose hatred fell 675 like the unseen blight of a smiling day the withering honey dew which clings under the bright green buds of may whilst they unfold their emerald wings for he made verses wild and queer 680 on the strange creeds priests hold so dear because they bring them land and gold <\s>
<s> of devils and saints and all such gear he made tales which whoso heard or read would laugh till he were almost dead <\s>
<s> 685 so this grew a proverb don't get old till lionel's banquet in hell you hear and then you will laugh yourself young again <\s>
<s> so the priests hated him and he repaid their hate with cheerful glee <\s>
<s> 690 ah smiles and joyance quickly died for public hope grew pale and dim in an altered time and tide and in its wasting withered him as a summer flower that blows too soon 695 droops in the smile of the waning moon when it scatters through an april night the frozen dews of wrinkling blight <\s>
<s> none now hoped more <\s>
<s> gray power was seated safely on her ancestral throne 700 and faith the python undefeated even to its blood stained steps dragged on her foul and wounded train and men were trampled and deceived again and words and shows again could bind 705 the wailing tribes of human kind in scorn and famine <\s>
<s> fire and blood raged round the raging multitude to fields remote by tyrants sent to be the scorned instrument 710 with which they drag from mines of gore the chains their slaves yet ever wore and in the streets men met each other and by old altars and in halls and smiled again at festivals <\s>
<s> 715 but each man found in his heart's brother cold cheer for all though half deceived the outworn creeds again believed and the same round anew began which the weary world yet ever ran <\s>
<s> 720 many then wept not tears but gall within their hearts like drops which fall wasting the fountain stone away <\s>
<s> and in that dark and evil day did all desires and thoughts that claim 725 men's care ambition friendship fame love hope though hope was now despair indue the colours of this change as from the all surrounding air the earth takes hues obscure and strange 730 when storm and earthquake linger there <\s>
<s> and so my friend it then befell to many most to lionel whose hope was like the life of youth within him and when dead became 735 a spirit of unresting flame which goaded him in his distress over the world's vast wilderness <\s>
<s> three years he left his native land and on the fourth when he returned 740 none knew him he was stricken deep with some disease of mind and turned into aught unlike lionel <\s>
<s> on him on whom did he pause in sleep serenest smiles were wont to keep 745 and did he wake a winged band of bright persuasions which had fed on his sweet lips and liquid eyes kept their swift pinions half outspread to do on men his least command 750 on him whom once twas paradise even to behold now misery lay in his own heart twas merciless to all things else none may express its innocence and tenderness <\s>
<s> 755 twas said that he had refuge sought in love from his unquiet thought in distant lands and been deceived by some strange show for there were found blotted with tears as those relieved 760 by their own words are wont to do these mournful verses on the ground by all who read them blotted too <\s>

<s> o from sleep most vainly must my weary brain implore its long lost flattery now i wake to weep 775 and sit through the long day gnawing the core of my bitter heart and like a miser keep since none in what i feel take pain or pleasure to my own soul its self consuming treasure <\s>

<s> then he passed amid the strife of men and stood at the throne of armed power 630 pleading for a world of woe secure as one on a rock built tower o'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro mid the passions wild of human kind he stood like a spirit calming them 635 for it was said his words could bind like music the lulled crowd and stem that torrent of unquiet dream which mortals truth and reason deem but is revenge and fear and pride <\s>

<s> his very gestures touched to tears the unpersuaded tyrant never so moved before his presence stung the torturers with their victim's pain 650 and none knew how and through their ears the subtle witchcraft of his tongue unlocked the hearts of those who keep gold the world's bond of slavery <\s>
<s> men wondered and some sneered to see 655 one sow what he could never reap for he is rich they said and young and might drink from the depths of luxury <\s>

<s> all that others seek he casts away like a vile weed which the sea casts unreturningly <\s>
<s> that poor and hungry men should break the laws which wreak them toil and scorn 670 we understand but lionel we know is rich and nobly born <\s>
<s> so wondered they yet all men loved young lionel though few approved all but the priests whose hatred fell 675 like the unseen blight of a smiling day the withering honey dew which clings under the bright green buds of may whilst they unfold their emerald wings for he made verses wild and queer 680 on the strange creeds priests hold so dear because they bring them land and gold <\s>
<s> of devils and saints and all such gear he made tales which whoso heard or read would laugh till he were almost dead <\s>
<s> 685 so this grew a proverb don't get old till lionel's banquet in hell you hear and then you will laugh yourself young again <\s>
<s> so the priests hated him and he repaid their hate with cheerful glee <\s>
<s> 690 ah smiles and joyance quickly died for public hope grew pale and dim in an altered time and tide and in its wasting withered him as a summer flower that blows too soon 695 droops in the smile of the waning moon when it scatters through an april night the frozen dews of wrinkling blight <\s>
<s> none now hoped more <\s>
<s> gray power was seated safely on her ancestral throne 700 and faith the python undefeated even to its blood stained steps dragged on her foul and wounded train and men were trampled and deceived again and words and shows again could bind 705 the wailing tribes of human kind in scorn and famine <\s>
<s> fire and blood raged round the raging multitude to fields remote by tyrants sent to be the scorned instrument 710 with which they drag from mines of gore the chains their slaves yet ever wore and in the streets men met each other and by old altars and in halls and smiled again at festivals <\s>
<s> 715 but each man found in his heart's brother cold cheer for all though half deceived the outworn creeds again believed and the same round anew began which the weary world yet ever ran <\s>
<s> 720 many then wept not tears but gall within their hearts like drops which fall wasting the fountain stone away <\s>
<s> and in that dark and evil day did all desires and thoughts that claim 725 men's care ambition friendship fame love hope though hope was now despair indue the colours of this change as from the all surrounding air the earth takes hues obscure and strange 730 when storm and earthquake linger there <\s>
<s> and so my friend it then befell to many most to lionel whose hope was like the life of youth within him and when dead became 735 a spirit of unresting flame which goaded him in his distress over the world's vast wilderness <\s>
<s> three years he left his native land and on the fourth when he returned 740 none knew him he was stricken deep with some disease of mind and turned into aught unlike lionel <\s>
<s> on him on whom did he pause in sleep serenest smiles were wont to keep 745 and did he wake a winged band of bright persuasions which had fed on his sweet lips and liquid eyes kept their swift pinions half outspread to do on men his least command 750 on him whom once twas paradise even to behold now misery lay in his own heart twas merciless to all things else none may express its innocence and tenderness <\s>
<s> 755 twas said that he had refuge sought in love from his unquiet thought in distant lands and been deceived by some strange show for there were found blotted with tears as those relieved 760 by their own words are wont to do these mournful verses on the ground by all who read them blotted too <\s>
<s> how am i changed <\s>
<s> my hopes were once like fire i loved and i believed that life was love <\s>
<s> 765 how am i lost <\s>
<s> on wings of swift desire among heaven's winds my spirit once did move <\s>
<s> i slept and silver dreams did aye inspire my liquid sleep i woke and did approve all nature to my heart and thought to make 770 a paradise of earth for one sweet sake <\s>
<s> i love but i believe in love no more <\s>
<s> i feel desire but hope not <\s>
<s> o from sleep most vainly must my weary brain implore its long lost flattery now i wake to weep 775 and sit through the long day gnawing the core of my bitter heart and like a miser keep since none in what i feel take pain or pleasure to my own soul its self consuming treasure <\s>
<s> he dwelt beside me near the sea 780 and oft in evening did we meet when the waves beneath the starlight flee o'er the yellow sands with silver feet and talked our talk was sad and sweet till slowly from his mien there passed 785 the desolation which it spoke and smiles as when the lightning's blast has parched some heaven delighting oak the next spring shows leaves pale and rare but like flowers delicate and fair 790 on its rent boughs again arrayed his countenance in tender light his words grew subtile fire which made the air his hearers breathed delight his motions like the winds were free 795 which bend the bright grass gracefully then fade away in circlets faint and winged hope on which upborne his soul seemed hovering in his eyes like some bright spirit newly born 800 floating amid the sunny skies sprang forth from his rent heart anew <\s>
<s> yet o'er his talk and looks and mien tempering their loveliness too keen past woe its shadow backward threw 805 till like an exhalation spread from flowers half drunk with evening dew they did become infectious sweet and subtle mists of sense and thought which wrapped us soon when we might meet 810 almost from our own looks and aught the wild world holds <\s>
<s> and so his mind was healed while mine grew sick with fear for ever now his health declined like some frail bark which cannot bear 815 the impulse of an altered wind though prosperous and my heart grew full mid its new joy of a new care for his cheek became not pale but fair as rose o'ershadowed lilies are 820 and soon his deep and sunny hair in this alone less beautiful like grass in tombs grew wild and rare <\s>
<s> the blood in his translucent veins beat not like animal life but love 825 seemed now its sullen springs to move when life had failed and all its pains and sudden sleep would seize him oft like death so calm but that a tear his pointed eyelashes between 830 would gather in the light serene of smiles whose lustre bright and soft beneath lay undulating there <\s>
<s> his breath was like inconstant flame as eagerly it went and came 835 and i hung o'er him in his sleep till like an image in the lake which rains disturb my tears would break the shadow of that slumber deep then he would bid me not to weep 840 and say with flattery false yet sweet that death and he could never meet if i would never part with him <\s>
<s> and so we loved and did unite all that in us was yet divided 845 for when he said that many a rite by men to bind but once provided could not be shared by him and me or they would kill him in their glee i shuddered and then laughing said 850 we will have rites our faith to bind but our church shall be the starry night our altar the grassy earth outspread and our priest the muttering wind <\s>
<s> twas sunset as i spoke one star 855 had scarce burst forth when from afar the ministers of misrule sent seized upon lionel and bore his chained limbs to a dreary tower in the midst of a city vast and wide <\s>
<s> 860 for he they said from his mind had bent against their gods keen blasphemy for which though his soul must roasted be in hell's red lakes immortally yet even on earth must he abide 865 the vengeance of their slaves a trial i think men call it <\s>
<s> what avail are prayers and tears which chase denial from the fierce savage nursed in hate <\s>
<s> what the knit soul that pleading and pale 870 makes wan the quivering cheek which late it painted with its own delight <\s>
<s> as i could i stilled the tingling of my blood and followed him in their despite 875 as a widow follows pale and wild the murderers and corse of her only child and when we came to the prison door and i prayed to share his dungeon floor with prayers which rarely have been spurned 880 and when men drove me forth and i stared with blank frenzy on the sky a farewell look of love he turned half calming me then gazed awhile as if thro that black and massy pile 885 and thro the crowd around him there and thro the dense and murky air and the thronged streets he did espy what poets know and prophesy and said with voice that made them shiver 890 and clung like music in my brain and which the mute walls spoke again prolonging it with deepened strain fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever or the priests of the bloody faith 895 they stand on the brink of that mighty river whose waves they have tainted with death it is fed from the depths of a thousand dells around them it foams and rages and swells and their swords and their sceptres i floating see 900 like wrecks in the surge of eternity <\s>
<s> i dwelt beside the prison gate and the strange crowd that out and in passed some no doubt with mine own fate might have fretted me with its ceaseless din 905 but the fever of care was louder within <\s>
<s> soon but too late in penitence or fear his foes released him thence i saw his thin and languid form as leaning on the jailor's arm 910 whose hardened eyes grew moist the while to meet his mute and faded smile and hear his words of kind farewell he tottered forth from his damp cell <\s>
<s> many had never wept before 915 from whom fast tears then gushed and fell many will relent no more who sobbed like infants then aye all who thronged the prison's stony hall the rulers or the slaves of law 920 felt with a new surprise and awe that they were human till strong shame made them again become the same <\s>
<s> the prison blood hounds huge and grim from human looks the infection caught 925 and fondly crouched and fawned on him and men have heard the prisoners say who in their rotting dungeons lay that from that hour throughout one day the fierce despair and hate which kept 930 their trampled bosoms almost slept where like twin vultures they hung feeding on each heart's wound wide torn and bleeding because their jailors rule they thought grew merciful like a parent's sway <\s>
<s> 935 i know not how but we were free and lionel sate alone with me as the carriage drove thro the streets apace and we looked upon each other's face and the blood in our fingers intertwined 940 ran like the thoughts of a single mind as the swift emotions went and came thro the veins of each united frame <\s>
<s> so thro the long long streets we passed of the million peopled city vast 945 which is that desert where each one seeks his mate yet is alone beloved and sought and mourned of none until the clear blue sky was seen and the grassy meadows bright and green 950 and then i sunk in his embrace enclosing there a mighty space of love and so we travelled on by woods and fields of yellow flowers and towns and villages and towers 955 day after day of happy hours <\s>
<s> it was the azure time of june when the skies are deep in the stainless noon and the warm and fitful breezes shake the fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar 960 and there were odours then to make the very breath we did respire a liquid element whereon our spirits like delighted things that walk the air on subtle wings 965 floated and mingled far away mid the warm winds of the sunny day <\s>
<s> and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth 970 like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earth's breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close 975 their languid leaves when daylight's gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth 980 in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears 985 a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea 990 which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed o'er <\s>
<s> the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully 995 and the old man's sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed o'er me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day 1000 he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he is o how beautiful <\s>
<s> 1005 yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which ne'er was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the rose like hues which flow 1010 from sunset o'er the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life o'er every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought <\s>

<s> he dwelt beside me near the sea 780 and oft in evening did we meet when the waves beneath the starlight flee o'er the yellow sands with silver feet and talked our talk was sad and sweet till slowly from his mien there passed 785 the desolation which it spoke and smiles as when the lightning's blast has parched some heaven delighting oak the next spring shows leaves pale and rare but like flowers delicate and fair 790 on its rent boughs again arrayed his countenance in tender light his words grew subtile fire which made the air his hearers breathed delight his motions like the winds were free 795 which bend the bright grass gracefully then fade away in circlets faint and winged hope on which upborne his soul seemed hovering in his eyes like some bright spirit newly born 800 floating amid the sunny skies sprang forth from his rent heart anew <\s>
<s> yet o'er his talk and looks and mien tempering their loveliness too keen past woe its shadow backward threw 805 till like an exhalation spread from flowers half drunk with evening dew they did become infectious sweet and subtle mists of sense and thought which wrapped us soon when we might meet 810 almost from our own looks and aught the wild world holds <\s>
<s> and so his mind was healed while mine grew sick with fear for ever now his health declined like some frail bark which cannot bear 815 the impulse of an altered wind though prosperous and my heart grew full mid its new joy of a new care for his cheek became not pale but fair as rose o'ershadowed lilies are 820 and soon his deep and sunny hair in this alone less beautiful like grass in tombs grew wild and rare <\s>
<s> the blood in his translucent veins beat not like animal life but love 825 seemed now its sullen springs to move when life had failed and all its pains and sudden sleep would seize him oft like death so calm but that a tear his pointed eyelashes between 830 would gather in the light serene of smiles whose lustre bright and soft beneath lay undulating there <\s>
<s> his breath was like inconstant flame as eagerly it went and came 835 and i hung o'er him in his sleep till like an image in the lake which rains disturb my tears would break the shadow of that slumber deep then he would bid me not to weep 840 and say with flattery false yet sweet that death and he could never meet if i would never part with him <\s>
<s> and so we loved and did unite all that in us was yet divided 845 for when he said that many a rite by men to bind but once provided could not be shared by him and me or they would kill him in their glee i shuddered and then laughing said 850 we will have rites our faith to bind but our church shall be the starry night our altar the grassy earth outspread and our priest the muttering wind <\s>

<s> i dwelt beside the prison gate and the strange crowd that out and in passed some no doubt with mine own fate might have fretted me with its ceaseless din 905 but the fever of care was louder within <\s>

<s> many had never wept before 915 from whom fast tears then gushed and fell many will relent no more who sobbed like infants then aye all who thronged the prison's stony hall the rulers or the slaves of law 920 felt with a new surprise and awe that they were human till strong shame made them again become the same <\s>
<s> the prison blood hounds huge and grim from human looks the infection caught 925 and fondly crouched and fawned on him and men have heard the prisoners say who in their rotting dungeons lay that from that hour throughout one day the fierce despair and hate which kept 930 their trampled bosoms almost slept where like twin vultures they hung feeding on each heart's wound wide torn and bleeding because their jailors rule they thought grew merciful like a parent's sway <\s>
<s> 935 i know not how but we were free and lionel sate alone with me as the carriage drove thro the streets apace and we looked upon each other's face and the blood in our fingers intertwined 940 ran like the thoughts of a single mind as the swift emotions went and came thro the veins of each united frame <\s>
<s> so thro the long long streets we passed of the million peopled city vast 945 which is that desert where each one seeks his mate yet is alone beloved and sought and mourned of none until the clear blue sky was seen and the grassy meadows bright and green 950 and then i sunk in his embrace enclosing there a mighty space of love and so we travelled on by woods and fields of yellow flowers and towns and villages and towers 955 day after day of happy hours <\s>
<s> it was the azure time of june when the skies are deep in the stainless noon and the warm and fitful breezes shake the fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar 960 and there were odours then to make the very breath we did respire a liquid element whereon our spirits like delighted things that walk the air on subtle wings 965 floated and mingled far away mid the warm winds of the sunny day <\s>
<s> and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth 970 like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earth's breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close 975 their languid leaves when daylight's gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth 980 in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears 985 a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea 990 which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed o'er <\s>
<s> the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully 995 and the old man's sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed o'er me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day 1000 he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he is o how beautiful <\s>
<s> 1005 yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which ne'er was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the rose like hues which flow 1010 from sunset o'er the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life o'er every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought <\s>
<s> when the summer wind faint odours brought 1015 from mountain flowers even as it passed his cheek would change as the noonday sea which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully <\s>
<s> if but a cloud the sky o'ercast you might see his colour come and go 1020 and the softest strain of music made sweet smiles yet sad arise and fade amid the dew of his tender eyes and the breath with intermitting flow made his pale lips quiver and part <\s>
<s> 1025 you might hear the beatings of his heart quick but not strong and with my tresses when oft he playfully would bind in the bowers of mossy lonelinesses his neck and win me so to mingle 1030 in the sweet depth of woven caresses and our faint limbs were intertwined alas <\s>
<s> the unquiet life did tingle from mine own heart through every vein like a captive in dreams of liberty 1035 who beats the walls of his stony cell <\s>
<s> but his it seemed already free like the shadow of fire surrounding me <\s>
<s> on my faint eyes and limbs did dwell that spirit as it passed till soon 1040 as a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon beneath its light invisible is seen when it folds its gray wings again to alight on midnight's dusky plain i lived and saw and the gathering soul 1045 passed from beneath that strong control and i fell on a life which was sick with fear of all the woe that now i bear <\s>
<s> amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and sea girt promontory 1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and o'er the gate was sculptured to fidelity 1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery <\s>
<s> 1060 the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its side convulsing heart <\s>
<s> 1065 an unskilled hand yet one informed with genius had the marble warmed with that pathetic life <\s>
<s> this tale it told a dog had from the sea when the tide was raging fearfully 1070 dragged lionel's mother weak and pale then died beside her on the sand and she that temple thence had planned but it was lionel's own hand had wrought the image <\s>

<s> and tears from her brown eyes did stain 1085 the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence 1090 from the hissing frankincense whose smoke wool white as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright 1095 o'er the split cedar's pointed flame and the lady's harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers 1100 and as they listened round shed tears <\s>
<s> one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud 1105 climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy 1110 then failing soothes the air again <\s>
<s> we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mother's harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft 1115 amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaven taught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poet bird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song <\s>
<s> 1120 heardst thou not sweet words among that heaven resounding minstrelsy <\s>

<s> let us drain right joyously the cup which the sweet bird fills for me <\s>
<s> 1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine 1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken 1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came 1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood 1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance 1155 of spirit piercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwind rifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined <\s>
<s> i paused but soon his gestures kindled 1160 new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung 1165 circles of life dissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly 1170 and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away 1175 in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love <\s>
<s> i said no word no look no motion <\s>

<s> amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and sea girt promontory 1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and o'er the gate was sculptured to fidelity 1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery <\s>
<s> 1060 the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its side convulsing heart <\s>

<s> and tears from her brown eyes did stain 1085 the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence 1090 from the hissing frankincense whose smoke wool white as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright 1095 o'er the split cedar's pointed flame and the lady's harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers 1100 and as they listened round shed tears <\s>
<s> one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud 1105 climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy 1110 then failing soothes the air again <\s>
<s> we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mother's harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft 1115 amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaven taught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poet bird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song <\s>

<s> 1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine 1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken 1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came 1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood 1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance 1155 of spirit piercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwind rifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined <\s>
<s> i paused but soon his gestures kindled 1160 new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung 1165 circles of life dissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly 1170 and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away 1175 in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love <\s>
<s> i said no word no look no motion <\s>
<s> yes 1180 there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moment's hope be told <\s>
<s> i looked and knew that he was dead and fell as the eagle on the plain falls when life deserts her brain 1185 and the mortal lightning is veiled again <\s>
<s> o that i were now dead <\s>
<s> but such did they not love demand too much those dying murmurs he forbade <\s>
<s> o that i once again were mad <\s>
<s> 1190 and yet dear rosalind not so for i would live to share thy woe <\s>
<s> did i forget thee too <\s>
<s> alas we know not what we do when we speak words <\s>
<s> no memory more 1195 is in my mind of that sea shore <\s>
<s> madness came on me and a troop of misty shapes did seem to sit beside me on a vessel's poop and the clear north wind was driving it <\s>
<s> 1200 then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me 1205 drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find 1210 that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before <\s>
<s> nor less 1215 wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept 1220 no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child <\s>
<s> tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change 1225 as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe <\s>
<s> that lionel great wealth had left by will to me and that of all the ready lies of law bereft 1230 my child and me might well befall <\s>
<s> but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my child's beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate 1235 the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame <\s>
<s> she ceased lo where red morning thro the woods 1240 is burning o'er the dew said rosalind <\s>
<s> and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore 1245 is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers 1250 scatters its sense dissolving fragrance o'er the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forest's limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helen's home and clean and white 1255 like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude its casements bright shone through their vine leaves in the morning sun and even within twas scarce like italy <\s>
<s> and when she saw how all things there were planned 1260 as in an english home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionel's 1265 those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it <\s>
<s> rosalind weep not at thine own words though they must make me weep <\s>
<s> what is thy tale <\s>
<s> helen i fear twill shake thy gentle heart with tears <\s>
<s> thou well rememberest when we met no more 595 and though i dwelt with lionel that friendless caution pierced me sore with grief a wound my spirit bore indignantly but when he died with him lay dead both hope and pride <\s>
<s> all hope is buried now <\s>
<s> but then men dreamed the aged earth was labouring in that mighty birth which many a poet and a sage has aye foreseen the happy age 605 when truth and love shall dwell below among the works and ways of men which on this world not power but will even now is wanting to fulfil <\s>
<s> among mankind what thence befell 610 of strife how vain is known too well when liberty's dear paean fell mid murderous howls <\s>
<s> to lionel though of great wealth and lineage high yet through those dungeon walls there came 615 thy thrilling light o liberty <\s>
<s> and as the meteor's midnight flame startles the dreamer sun like truth flashed on his visionary youth and filled him not with love but faith 620 and hope and courage mute in death for love and life in him were twins born at one birth in every other first life then love its course begins though they be children of one mother 625 and so through this dark world they fleet divided till in death they meet but he loved all things ever <\s>
<s> then he passed amid the strife of men and stood at the throne of armed power 630 pleading for a world of woe secure as one on a rock built tower o'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro mid the passions wild of human kind he stood like a spirit calming them 635 for it was said his words could bind like music the lulled crowd and stem that torrent of unquiet dream which mortals truth and reason deem but is revenge and fear and pride <\s>
<s> 640 joyous he was and hope and peace on all who heard him did abide raining like dew from his sweet talk as where the evening star may walk along the brink of the gloomy seas 645 liquid mists of splendour quiver <\s>
<s> his very gestures touched to tears the unpersuaded tyrant never so moved before his presence stung the torturers with their victim's pain 650 and none knew how and through their ears the subtle witchcraft of his tongue unlocked the hearts of those who keep gold the world's bond of slavery <\s>
<s> men wondered and some sneered to see 655 one sow what he could never reap for he is rich they said and young and might drink from the depths of luxury <\s>
<s> if he seeks fame fame never crowned the champion of a trampled creed 660 if he seeks power power is enthroned mid ancient rights and wrongs to feed which hungry wolves with praise and spoil those who would sit near power must toil and such there sitting all may see <\s>
<s> 665 what seeks he <\s>
<s> all that others seek he casts away like a vile weed which the sea casts unreturningly <\s>
<s> that poor and hungry men should break the laws which wreak them toil and scorn 670 we understand but lionel we know is rich and nobly born <\s>
<s> so wondered they yet all men loved young lionel though few approved all but the priests whose hatred fell 675 like the unseen blight of a smiling day the withering honey dew which clings under the bright green buds of may whilst they unfold their emerald wings for he made verses wild and queer 680 on the strange creeds priests hold so dear because they bring them land and gold <\s>
<s> of devils and saints and all such gear he made tales which whoso heard or read would laugh till he were almost dead <\s>
<s> 685 so this grew a proverb don't get old till lionel's banquet in hell you hear and then you will laugh yourself young again <\s>
<s> so the priests hated him and he repaid their hate with cheerful glee <\s>
<s> 690 ah smiles and joyance quickly died for public hope grew pale and dim in an altered time and tide and in its wasting withered him as a summer flower that blows too soon 695 droops in the smile of the waning moon when it scatters through an april night the frozen dews of wrinkling blight <\s>
<s> none now hoped more <\s>
<s> gray power was seated safely on her ancestral throne 700 and faith the python undefeated even to its blood stained steps dragged on her foul and wounded train and men were trampled and deceived again and words and shows again could bind 705 the wailing tribes of human kind in scorn and famine <\s>
<s> fire and blood raged round the raging multitude to fields remote by tyrants sent to be the scorned instrument 710 with which they drag from mines of gore the chains their slaves yet ever wore and in the streets men met each other and by old altars and in halls and smiled again at festivals <\s>
<s> 715 but each man found in his heart's brother cold cheer for all though half deceived the outworn creeds again believed and the same round anew began which the weary world yet ever ran <\s>
<s> 720 many then wept not tears but gall within their hearts like drops which fall wasting the fountain stone away <\s>
<s> and in that dark and evil day did all desires and thoughts that claim 725 men's care ambition friendship fame love hope though hope was now despair indue the colours of this change as from the all surrounding air the earth takes hues obscure and strange 730 when storm and earthquake linger there <\s>
<s> and so my friend it then befell to many most to lionel whose hope was like the life of youth within him and when dead became 735 a spirit of unresting flame which goaded him in his distress over the world's vast wilderness <\s>

<s> and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth 970 like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earth's breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close 975 their languid leaves when daylight's gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth 980 in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears 985 a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea 990 which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed o'er <\s>
<s> the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully 995 and the old man's sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed o'er me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day 1000 he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he is o how beautiful <\s>
<s> 1005 yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which ne'er was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the rose like hues which flow 1010 from sunset o'er the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life o'er every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought <\s>
<s> when the summer wind faint odours brought 1015 from mountain flowers even as it passed his cheek would change as the noonday sea which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully <\s>
<s> if but a cloud the sky o'ercast you might see his colour come and go 1020 and the softest strain of music made sweet smiles yet sad arise and fade amid the dew of his tender eyes and the breath with intermitting flow made his pale lips quiver and part <\s>
<s> 1025 you might hear the beatings of his heart quick but not strong and with my tresses when oft he playfully would bind in the bowers of mossy lonelinesses his neck and win me so to mingle 1030 in the sweet depth of woven caresses and our faint limbs were intertwined alas <\s>
<s> the unquiet life did tingle from mine own heart through every vein like a captive in dreams of liberty 1035 who beats the walls of his stony cell <\s>
<s> but his it seemed already free like the shadow of fire surrounding me <\s>
<s> on my faint eyes and limbs did dwell that spirit as it passed till soon 1040 as a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon beneath its light invisible is seen when it folds its gray wings again to alight on midnight's dusky plain i lived and saw and the gathering soul 1045 passed from beneath that strong control and i fell on a life which was sick with fear of all the woe that now i bear <\s>
<s> amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and sea girt promontory 1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and o'er the gate was sculptured to fidelity 1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery <\s>
<s> 1060 the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its side convulsing heart <\s>
<s> 1065 an unskilled hand yet one informed with genius had the marble warmed with that pathetic life <\s>
<s> this tale it told a dog had from the sea when the tide was raging fearfully 1070 dragged lionel's mother weak and pale then died beside her on the sand and she that temple thence had planned but it was lionel's own hand had wrought the image <\s>
<s> each new moon 1075 that lady did in this lone fane the rites of a religion sweet whose god was in her heart and brain the seasons loveliest flowers were strewn on the marble floor beneath her feet 1080 and she brought crowns of sea buds white whose odour is so sweet and faint and weeds like branching chrysolite woven in devices fine and quaint <\s>
<s> and tears from her brown eyes did stain 1085 the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence 1090 from the hissing frankincense whose smoke wool white as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright 1095 o'er the split cedar's pointed flame and the lady's harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers 1100 and as they listened round shed tears <\s>
<s> one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud 1105 climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy 1110 then failing soothes the air again <\s>
<s> we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mother's harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft 1115 amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaven taught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poet bird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song <\s>
<s> 1120 heardst thou not sweet words among that heaven resounding minstrelsy <\s>
<s> heard'st thou not that those who die awake in a world of ecstasy <\s>
<s> that love when limbs are interwoven 1125 and sleep when the night of life is cloven and thought to the world's dim boundaries clinging and music when one beloved is singing is death <\s>
<s> let us drain right joyously the cup which the sweet bird fills for me <\s>
<s> 1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine 1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken 1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came 1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood 1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance 1155 of spirit piercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwind rifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined <\s>
<s> i paused but soon his gestures kindled 1160 new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung 1165 circles of life dissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly 1170 and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away 1175 in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love <\s>
<s> i said no word no look no motion <\s>
<s> yes 1180 there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moment's hope be told <\s>
<s> i looked and knew that he was dead and fell as the eagle on the plain falls when life deserts her brain 1185 and the mortal lightning is veiled again <\s>
<s> o that i were now dead <\s>
<s> but such did they not love demand too much those dying murmurs he forbade <\s>
<s> o that i once again were mad <\s>
<s> 1190 and yet dear rosalind not so for i would live to share thy woe <\s>
<s> did i forget thee too <\s>
<s> alas we know not what we do when we speak words <\s>
<s> no memory more 1195 is in my mind of that sea shore <\s>
<s> madness came on me and a troop of misty shapes did seem to sit beside me on a vessel's poop and the clear north wind was driving it <\s>
<s> 1200 then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me 1205 drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find 1210 that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before <\s>
<s> nor less 1215 wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept 1220 no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child <\s>
<s> tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change 1225 as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe <\s>
<s> that lionel great wealth had left by will to me and that of all the ready lies of law bereft 1230 my child and me might well befall <\s>
<s> but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my child's beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate 1235 the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame <\s>
<s> she ceased lo where red morning thro the woods 1240 is burning o'er the dew said rosalind <\s>
<s> and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore 1245 is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers 1250 scatters its sense dissolving fragrance o'er the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forest's limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helen's home and clean and white 1255 like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude its casements bright shone through their vine leaves in the morning sun and even within twas scarce like italy <\s>
<s> and when she saw how all things there were planned 1260 as in an english home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionel's 1265 those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it <\s>
