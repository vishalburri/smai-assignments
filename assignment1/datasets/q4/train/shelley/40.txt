<s> the south of europe was in a state of great political excitement at the beginning of the year 1821 <\s>
<s> the spanish revolution had been a signal to italy secrete societies were formed and when naples rose to declare the constitution the call was responded to from brundusium to the foot of the alps <\s>
<s> to crush these attempts to obtain liberty early in 1821 the austrians poured their armies into the peninsula at first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a people long enslaved <\s>
<s> the piedmontese asserted their freedom genoa threw off the yoke of the king of sardinia and as if in playful imitation the people of the little state of massa and carrara gave the conge to their sovereign and set up a republic <\s>
<s> tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil <\s>
<s> it was said that the austrian minister presented a list of sixty carbonari to the grand duke urging their imprisonment and the grand duke replied i do not know whether these sixty men are carbonari but i know if i imprison them i shall directly have sixty thousand start up <\s>
<s> but though the tuscans had no desire to disturb the paternal government beneath whose shelter they slumbered they regarded the progress of the various italian revolutions with intense interest and hatred for the austrian was warm in every bosom <\s>
<s> but they had slender hopes they knew that the neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular german troops and that the overthrow of the constitution in naples would act as a decisive blow against all struggles for liberty in italy <\s>
<s> we have seen the rise and progress of reform <\s>
<s> but the holy alliance was alive and active in those days and few could dream of the peaceful triumph of liberty <\s>
<s> it seemed then that the armed assertion of freedom in the south of europe was the only hope of the liberals as if it prevailed the nations of the north would imitate the example <\s>

<s> then as i have said in 1821 shelley as well as every other lover of liberty looked upon the struggles in spain and italy as decisive of the destinies of the world probably for centuries to come <\s>
<s> the interest he took in the progress of affairs was intense <\s>
<s> when genoa declared itself free his hopes were at their highest <\s>
<s> day after day he read the bulletins of the austrian army and sought eagerly to gather tokens of its defeat <\s>
<s> he heard of the revolt of genoa with emotions of transport <\s>
<s> his whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause <\s>
<s> we were living at pisa at that time and several well informed italians at the head of whom we may place the celebrated vacca were accustomed to seek for sympathy in their hopes from shelley they did not find such for the despair they too generally experienced founded on contempt for their southern countrymen <\s>
<s> while the fate of the progress of the austrian armies then invading naples was yet in suspense the news of another revolution filled him with exultation <\s>
<s> we had formed the acquaintance at pisa of several constantinopolitan greeks of the family of prince caradja formerly hospodar of wallachia who hearing that the bowstring the accustomed finale of his viceroyalty was on the road to him escaped with his treasures and took up his abode in tuscany <\s>
<s> among these was the gentleman to whom the drama of hellas is dedicated <\s>
<s> prince mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country which filled the hearts of many of his countrymen <\s>
<s> he often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in greece but we had no idea of its being so near at hand when on the 1st of april 1821 he called on shelley bringing the proclamation of his cousin prince ypsilanti and radiant with exultation and delight declared that henceforth greece would be free <\s>
<s> shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in spain and naples in two odes dictated by the warmest enthusiasm he felt himself naturally impelled to decorate with poetry the uprise of the descendants of that people whose works he regarded with deep admiration and to adopt the vaticinatory character in prophesying their success <\s>
<s> hellas was written in a moment of enthusiasm <\s>
<s> it is curious to remark how well he overcomes the difficulty of forming a drama out of such scant materials <\s>
<s> his prophecies indeed came true in their general not their particular purport <\s>
<s> he did not foresee the death of lord londonderry which was to be the epoch of a change in english politics particularly as regarded foreign affairs nor that the navy of his country would fight for instead of against the greeks and by the battle of navarino secure their enfranchisement from the turks <\s>
<s> almost against reason as it appeared to him he resolved to believe that greece would prove triumphant and in this spirit auguring ultimate good yet grieving over the vicissitudes to be endured in the interval he composed his drama <\s>
<s> hellas was among the last of his compositions and is among the most beautiful <\s>
<s> the choruses are singularly imaginative and melodious in their versification <\s>
<s> there are some stanzas that beautifully exemplify shelley's peculiar style as for instance the assertion of the intellectual empire which must be for ever the inheritance of the country of homer sophocles and plato but greece and her foundations are built below the tide of war based on the crystalline sea of thought and its eternity <\s>
<s> and again that philosophical truth felicitously imaged forth revenge and wrong bring forth their kind the foul cubs like their parents are their den is in the guilty mind and conscience feeds them with despair <\s>
<s> the conclusion of the last chorus is among the most beautiful of his lyrics <\s>
<s> the imagery is distinct and majestic the prophecy such as poets love to dwell upon the regeneration of mankind and that regeneration reflecting back splendour on the foregone time from which it inherits so much of intellectual wealth and memory of past virtuous deeds as must render the possession of happiness and peace of tenfold value <\s>

<s> the popular notions of christianity are represented in this chorus as true in their relation to the worship they superseded and that which in all probability they will supersede without considering their merits in a relation more universal <\s>
<s> the first stanza contrasts the immortality of the living and thinking beings which inhabit the planets and to use a common and inadequate phrase clothe themselves in matter with the transience of the noblest manifestations of the external world <\s>

<s> let it not be supposed that i mean to dogmatise upon a subject concerning which all men are equally ignorant or that i think the gordian knot of the origin of evil can be disentangled by that or any similar assertions <\s>
<s> the received hypothesis of a being resembling men in the moral attributes of his nature having called us out of non existence and after inflicting on us the misery of the commission of error should superadd that of the punishment and the privations consequent upon it still would remain inexplicable and incredible <\s>
<s> that there is a true solution of the riddle and that in our present state that solution is unattainable by us are propositions which may be regarded as equally certain meanwhile as it is the province of the poet to attach himself to those ideas which exalt and ennoble humanity let him be permitted to have conjectured the condition of that futurity towards which we are all impelled by an inextinguishable thirst for immortality <\s>
<s> until better arguments can be produced than sophisms which disgrace the cause this desire itself must remain the strongest and the only presumption that eternity is the inheritance of every thinking being <\s>

<s> the greek patriarch after haying been compelled to fulminate an anathema against the insurgents was put to death by the turks <\s>
<s> fortunately the greeks have been taught that they cannot buy security by degradation and the turks though equally cruel are less cunning than the smooth faced tyrants of europe <\s>
<s> as to the anathema his holiness might as well have thrown his mitre at mount athos for any effect that it produced <\s>

<s> a greek who had been lord byron's servant commands the insurgents in attica <\s>
<s> this greek lord byron informs me though a poet and an enthusiastic patriot gave him rather the idea of a timid and unenterprising person <\s>

<s> the manner of the invocation of the spirit of mahomet the second will be censured as over subtle <\s>
<s> i could easily have made the jew a regular conjuror and the phantom an ordinary ghost <\s>
<s> i have preferred to represent the jew as disclaiming all pretension or even belief in supernatural agency and as tempting mahmud to that state of mind in which ideas may be supposed to assume the force of sensations through the confusion of thought with the objects of thought and the excess of passion animating the creations of imagination <\s>

<s> prophecies of wars and rumours of wars etc may safely be made by poet or prophet in any age but to anticipate however darkly a period of regeneration and happiness is a more hazardous exercise of the faculty which bards possess or feign <\s>
<s> it will remind the reader magno nec proximus intervallo of isaiah and virgil whose ardent spirits overleaping the actual reign of evil which we endure and bewail already saw the possible and perhaps approaching state of society in which the lion shall lie down with the lamb and omnis feret omnia tellus <\s>

<s> the grecian gods seem indeed to have been personally more innocent although it cannot be said that as far as temperance and chastity are concerned they gave so edifying an example as their successor <\s>
<s> the sublime human character of jesus christ was deformed by an imputed identification with a power who tempted betrayed and punished the innocent beings who were called into existence by his sole will and for the period of a thousand years the spirit of this most just wise and benevolent of men has been propitiated with myriads of hecatombs of those who approached the nearest to his innocence and wisdom sacrificed under every aggravation of atrocity and variety of torture <\s>

<s> note on hellas by mrs <\s>
<s> the south of europe was in a state of great political excitement at the beginning of the year 1821 <\s>
<s> the spanish revolution had been a signal to italy secrete societies were formed and when naples rose to declare the constitution the call was responded to from brundusium to the foot of the alps <\s>
<s> to crush these attempts to obtain liberty early in 1821 the austrians poured their armies into the peninsula at first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a people long enslaved <\s>
<s> the piedmontese asserted their freedom genoa threw off the yoke of the king of sardinia and as if in playful imitation the people of the little state of massa and carrara gave the conge to their sovereign and set up a republic <\s>
<s> tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil <\s>
<s> it was said that the austrian minister presented a list of sixty carbonari to the grand duke urging their imprisonment and the grand duke replied i do not know whether these sixty men are carbonari but i know if i imprison them i shall directly have sixty thousand start up <\s>
<s> but though the tuscans had no desire to disturb the paternal government beneath whose shelter they slumbered they regarded the progress of the various italian revolutions with intense interest and hatred for the austrian was warm in every bosom <\s>
<s> but they had slender hopes they knew that the neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular german troops and that the overthrow of the constitution in naples would act as a decisive blow against all struggles for liberty in italy <\s>
<s> we have seen the rise and progress of reform <\s>
<s> but the holy alliance was alive and active in those days and few could dream of the peaceful triumph of liberty <\s>
<s> it seemed then that the armed assertion of freedom in the south of europe was the only hope of the liberals as if it prevailed the nations of the north would imitate the example <\s>
<s> happily the reverse has proved the fact <\s>
<s> the countries accustomed to the exercise of the privileges of freemen to a limited extent have extended and are extending these limits <\s>
<s> freedom and knowledge have now a chance of proceeding hand in hand and if it continue thus we may hope for the durability of both <\s>
<s> then as i have said in 1821 shelley as well as every other lover of liberty looked upon the struggles in spain and italy as decisive of the destinies of the world probably for centuries to come <\s>
<s> the interest he took in the progress of affairs was intense <\s>
<s> when genoa declared itself free his hopes were at their highest <\s>
<s> day after day he read the bulletins of the austrian army and sought eagerly to gather tokens of its defeat <\s>
<s> he heard of the revolt of genoa with emotions of transport <\s>
<s> his whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause <\s>
<s> we were living at pisa at that time and several well informed italians at the head of whom we may place the celebrated vacca were accustomed to seek for sympathy in their hopes from shelley they did not find such for the despair they too generally experienced founded on contempt for their southern countrymen <\s>
<s> while the fate of the progress of the austrian armies then invading naples was yet in suspense the news of another revolution filled him with exultation <\s>
<s> we had formed the acquaintance at pisa of several constantinopolitan greeks of the family of prince caradja formerly hospodar of wallachia who hearing that the bowstring the accustomed finale of his viceroyalty was on the road to him escaped with his treasures and took up his abode in tuscany <\s>
<s> among these was the gentleman to whom the drama of hellas is dedicated <\s>
<s> prince mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country which filled the hearts of many of his countrymen <\s>
<s> he often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in greece but we had no idea of its being so near at hand when on the 1st of april 1821 he called on shelley bringing the proclamation of his cousin prince ypsilanti and radiant with exultation and delight declared that henceforth greece would be free <\s>
<s> shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in spain and naples in two odes dictated by the warmest enthusiasm he felt himself naturally impelled to decorate with poetry the uprise of the descendants of that people whose works he regarded with deep admiration and to adopt the vaticinatory character in prophesying their success <\s>
<s> hellas was written in a moment of enthusiasm <\s>
<s> it is curious to remark how well he overcomes the difficulty of forming a drama out of such scant materials <\s>
<s> his prophecies indeed came true in their general not their particular purport <\s>
<s> he did not foresee the death of lord londonderry which was to be the epoch of a change in english politics particularly as regarded foreign affairs nor that the navy of his country would fight for instead of against the greeks and by the battle of navarino secure their enfranchisement from the turks <\s>
<s> almost against reason as it appeared to him he resolved to believe that greece would prove triumphant and in this spirit auguring ultimate good yet grieving over the vicissitudes to be endured in the interval he composed his drama <\s>
<s> hellas was among the last of his compositions and is among the most beautiful <\s>
<s> the choruses are singularly imaginative and melodious in their versification <\s>
<s> there are some stanzas that beautifully exemplify shelley's peculiar style as for instance the assertion of the intellectual empire which must be for ever the inheritance of the country of homer sophocles and plato but greece and her foundations are built below the tide of war based on the crystalline sea of thought and its eternity <\s>
<s> and again that philosophical truth felicitously imaged forth revenge and wrong bring forth their kind the foul cubs like their parents are their den is in the guilty mind and conscience feeds them with despair <\s>
<s> the conclusion of the last chorus is among the most beautiful of his lyrics <\s>
<s> the imagery is distinct and majestic the prophecy such as poets love to dwell upon the regeneration of mankind and that regeneration reflecting back splendour on the foregone time from which it inherits so much of intellectual wealth and memory of past virtuous deeds as must render the possession of happiness and peace of tenfold value <\s>
