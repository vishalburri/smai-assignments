<s> i now say what i think <\s>
<s> cyprian enough you foolish fellows <\s>
<s> 35 puffed up with your own doting ignorance you always take the two sides of one question <\s>
<s> now go and as i said return for me when night falls veiling in its shadows wide this glorious fabric of the universe <\s>

<s> clarin nay the consequence is clear who ever did what he advises others to do moscon would that my feet were wings 45 so would i fly to livia <\s>
<s> exit clarin to speak truth livia is she who has surprised my heart but he is more than half way there soho <\s>
<s> livia i come good sport livia soho <\s>
<s> exit cyprian now since i am alone let me examine 50 the question which has long disturbed my mind with doubt since first i read in plinius the words of mystic import and deep sense in which he defines god <\s>
<s> my intellect can find no god with whom these marks and signs 55 fitly agree <\s>
<s> it is a hidden truth which i must fathom <\s>
<s> cyprian reads the daemon dressed in a court dress enters note 57 stage direction so transcr <\s>
<s> enter the devil as a fine gentleman 1824 <\s>
<s> daemon search even as thou wilt but thou shalt never find what i can hide <\s>
<s> cyprian what noise is that among the boughs <\s>
<s> what art thou daemon tis a foreign gentleman <\s>
<s> 60 even from this morning i have lost my way in this wild place and my poor horse at last quite overcome has stretched himself upon the enamelled tapestry of this mossy mountain and feeds and rests at the same time <\s>
<s> i was 65 upon my way to antioch upon business of some importance but wrapped up in cares who is exempt from this inheritance i parted from my company and lost my way and lost my servants and my comrades <\s>
<s> 70 cyprian tis singular that even within the sight of the high towers of antioch you could lose your way <\s>
<s> of all the avenues and green paths of this wild wood there is not one but leads as to its centre to the walls of antioch 75 take which you will you cannot miss your road <\s>
<s> daemon and such is ignorance <\s>
<s> even in the sight of knowledge it can draw no profit from it <\s>
<s> but as it still is early and as i have no acquaintances in antioch 80 being a stranger there i will even wait the few surviving hours of the day until the night shall conquer it <\s>
<s> i see both by your dress and by the books in which you find delight and company that you 85 are a great student for my part i feel much sympathy in such pursuits <\s>
<s> note 87 in transcr with 1824 <\s>
<s> cyprian have you studied much <\s>
<s> daemon no and yet i know enough not to be wholly ignorant <\s>
<s> cyprian pray sir what science may you know daemon many <\s>
<s> 90 much pains must we expend on one alone and even then attain it not but you have the presumption to assert that you know many without study <\s>
<s> daemon and with truth <\s>
<s> for in the country whence i come the sciences 95 require no learning they are known <\s>
<s> note 95 come the sciences come sciences 1824 <\s>
<s> cyprian oh would i were of that bright country <\s>
<s> for in this the more we study we the more discover our ignorance <\s>
<s> daemon it is so true that i had so much arrogance as to oppose 100 the chair of the most high professorship and obtained many votes and though i lost the attempt was still more glorious than the failure could be dishonourable <\s>
<s> if you believe not let us refer it to dispute respecting 105 that which you know the best and although i know not the opinion you maintain and though it be the true one i will take the contrary <\s>
<s> note 106 the transcr wanting 1824 <\s>
<s> cyprian the offer gives me pleasure <\s>
<s> i am now debating with myself upon a passage 110 of plinius and my mind is racked with doubt to understand and know who is the god of whom he speaks <\s>
<s> daemon it is a passage if i recollect it right couched in these words god is one supreme goodness one pure essence 115 one substance and one sense all sight all hands <\s>
<s> daemon what difficulty find you here <\s>
<s> cyprian i do not recognize among the gods the god defined by plinius if he must be supreme goodness even jupiter 120 is not supremely good because we see his deeds are evil and his attributes tainted with mortal weakness in what manner can supreme goodness be consistent with the passions of humanity <\s>
<s> daemon the wisdom 125 of the old world masked with the names of gods the attributes of nature and of man a sort of popular philosophy <\s>
<s> cyprian this reply will not satisfy me for such awe is due to the high name of god 130 that ill should never be imputed <\s>
<s> then examining the question with more care it follows that the gods would always will that which is best were they supremely good <\s>
<s> how then does one will one thing one another <\s>
<s> 135 and that you may not say that i allege poetical or philosophic learning consider the ambiguous responses of their oracular statues from two shrines two armies shall obtain the assurance of 140 one victory <\s>
<s> is it not indisputable that two contending wills can never lead to the same end <\s>
<s> and being opposite if one be good is not the other evil <\s>
<s> evil in god is inconceivable 145 but supreme goodness fails among the gods without their union <\s>
<s> note 133 would transcr should 1824 <\s>
<s> daemon i deny your major <\s>
<s> these responses are means towards some end unfathomed by our intellectual beam <\s>
<s> they are the work of providence and more 150 the battle's loss may profit those who lose than victory advantage those who win <\s>
<s> cyprian that i admit and yet that god should not falsehood is incompatible with deity assure the victory it would be enough 155 to have permitted the defeat <\s>
<s> if god be all sight god who had beheld the truth would not have given assurance of an end never to be accomplished thus although the deity may according to his attributes 160 be well distinguished into persons yet even in the minutest circumstance his essence must be one <\s>
<s> note 157 had transcr wanting 1824 <\s>
<s> daemon to attain the end the affections of the actors in the scene must have been thus influenced by his voice <\s>
<s> 165 cyprian but for a purpose thus subordinate he might have employed genii good or evil a sort of spirits called so by the learned who roam about inspiring good or evil and from whose influence and existence we 170 may well infer our immortality <\s>
<s> thus god might easily without descent to a gross falsehood in his proper person have moved the affections by this mediation to the just point <\s>
<s> note 172 descent transcr descending 1824 <\s>
<s> daemon these trifling contradictions 175 do not suffice to impugn the unity of the high gods in things of great importance they still appear unanimous consider that glorious fabric man his workmanship is stamped with one conception <\s>
<s> cyprian who made man 180 must have methinks the advantage of the others <\s>
<s> if they are equal might they not have risen in opposition to the work and being all hands according to our author here have still destroyed even as the other made <\s>
<s> 185 if equal in their power unequal only in opportunity which of the two will remain conqueror <\s>
<s> note 186 unequal only transcr and only unequal 1824 <\s>
<s> daemon on impossible and false hypothesis there can be built no argument <\s>
<s> say what do you infer 190 from this <\s>
<s> cyprian that there must be a mighty god of supreme goodness and of highest grace all sight all hands all truth infallible without an equal and without a rival the cause of all things and the effect of nothing 195 one power one will one substance and one essence <\s>
<s> and in whatever persons one or two his attributes may be distinguished one sovereign power one solitary essence one cause of all cause <\s>
<s> note 197 and query ay <\s>
<s> they rise daemon how can i impugn 200 so clear a consequence <\s>
<s> note 200 all cause 1824 all things transcr <\s>
<s> cyprian do you regret my victory <\s>
<s> daemon who but regrets a check in rivalry of wit <\s>
<s> i could reply and urge new difficulties but will now depart for i hear steps of men approaching 205 and it is time that i should now pursue my journey to the city <\s>
<s> cyprian go in peace <\s>
<s> daemon remain in peace since thus it profits him to study i will wrap his senses up in sweet oblivion of all thought but of 210 a piece of excellent beauty and as i have power given me to wage enmity against justina's soul i will extract from one effect two vengeances <\s>
