<s> a most important subject trifler this 435 to lay before the gods nay father nay when you have understood the business say not that i alone am fond of prey <\s>

<s> i never saw his like either in heaven or upon earth for knavery or craft out of the field my cattle yester even 445 by the low shore on which the loud sea laughed he right down to the river ford had driven and mere astonishment would make you daft to see the double kind of footsteps strange he has impressed wherever he did range <\s>
<s> the cattle's track on the black dust full well is evident as if they went towards the place from which they came that asphodel meadow in which i feed my many herds his steps were most incomprehensible 455 i know not how i can describe in words those tracks he could have gone along the sands neither upon his feet nor on his hands 59 <\s>
<s> he must have had some other stranger mode of moving on those vestiges immense 460 far as i traced them on the sandy road seemed like the trail of oak toppings but thence no mark nor track denoting where they trod the hard ground gave but working at his fence a mortal hedger saw him as he passed 465 to pylos with the cows in fiery haste <\s>
<s> i found that in the dark he quietly had sacrificed some cows and before light had thrown the ashes all dispersedly about the road then still as gloomy night 470 had crept into his cradle either eye rubbing and cogitating some new sleight <\s>

<s> i taxed him with the fact when he averred 475 most solemnly that he did neither see nor even had in any manner heard of my lost cows whatever things cows be nor could he tell though offered a reward not even who could tell of them to me <\s>

<s> at sunrise phoebus came but with no band of gods to bear him witness in great wrath to my abode seeking his heifers there and saying that i must show him where they are 490 63 <\s>

<s> i know that every apollonian limb is clothed with speed and might and manliness as a green bank with flowers but unlike him i was born yesterday and you may guess 495 he well knew this when he indulged the whim of bullying a poor little new born thing that slept and never thought of cow driving <\s>
<s> am i like a strong fellow who steals kine <\s>
<s> believe me dearest father such you are 500 this driving of the herds is none of mine across my threshold did i wander ne'er so may i thrive <\s>
<s> i reverence the divine sun and the gods and i love you and care even for this hard accuser who must know 505 i am as innocent as they or you <\s>
<s> i swear by these most gloriously wrought portals it is you will allow an oath of might through which the multitude of the immortals pass and repass forever day and night 510 devising schemes for the affairs of mortals i am guiltless and i will requite although mine enemy be great and strong his cruel threat do thou defend the young <\s>
<s> so speaking the cyllenian argiphont 515 winked as if now his adversary was fitted and jupiter according to his wont laughed heartily to hear the subtle witted infant give such a plausible account and every word a lie <\s>
<s> but he remitted 520 judgement at present and his exhortation was to compose the affair by arbitration <\s>
<s> and they by mighty jupiter were bidden to go forth with a single purpose both neither the other chiding nor yet chidden 525 and mercury with innocence and truth to lead the way and show where he had hidden the mighty heifers hermes nothing loth obeyed the aegis bearer's will for he is able to persuade all easily <\s>
<s> these lovely children of heaven's highest lord hastened to pylos and the pastures wide and lofty stalls by the alphean ford where wealth in the mute night is multiplied with silent growth <\s>
<s> whilst hermes drove the herd 535 out of the stony cavern phoebus spied the hides of those the little babe had slain stretched on the precipice above the plain <\s>

<s> even i myself may well hereafter dread your prowess offspring of cyllenian may when you grow strong and tall he spoke and bound 545 stiff withy bands the infant's wrists around <\s>
<s> he might as well have bound the oxen wild the withy bands though starkly interknit fell at the feet of the immortal child loosened by some device of his quick wit <\s>

<s> i swear by these most gloriously wrought portals it is you will allow an oath of might through which the multitude of the immortals pass and repass forever day and night 510 devising schemes for the affairs of mortals i am guiltless and i will requite although mine enemy be great and strong his cruel threat do thou defend the young <\s>
<s> so speaking the cyllenian argiphont 515 winked as if now his adversary was fitted and jupiter according to his wont laughed heartily to hear the subtle witted infant give such a plausible account and every word a lie <\s>

<s> and then apollo with the plectrum strook 670 the chords and from beneath his hands a crash of mighty sounds rushed up whose music shook the soul with sweetness and like an adept his sweeter voice a just accordance kept <\s>
<s> the herd went wandering o'er the divine mead 675 whilst these most beautiful sons of jupiter won their swift way up to the snowy head of white olympus with the joyous lyre soothing their journey and their father dread gathered them both into familiar 680 affection sweet and then and now and ever hermes must love him of the golden quiver 87 <\s>
<s> to whom he gave the lyre that sweetly sounded which skilfully he held and played thereon <\s>

<s> that you will never rob me you will do a thing extremely pleasing to my heart <\s>
<s> 700 then mercury swore by the stygian dew that he would never steal his bow or dart or lay his hands on what to him was due or ever would employ his powerful art against his pythian fane <\s>
<s> then phoebus swore 705 there was no god or man whom he loved more <\s>
<s> and i will give thee as a good will token the beautiful wand of wealth and happiness a perfect three leaved rod of gold unbroken whose magic will thy footsteps ever bless 710 and whatsoever by jove's voice is spoken of earthly or divine from its recess it like a loving soul to thee will speak and more than this do thou forbear to seek <\s>
<s> for dearest child the divinations high 715 which thou requirest tis unlawful ever that thou or any other deity should understand and vain were the endeavour for they are hidden in jove's mind and i in trust of them have sworn that i would never 720 betray the counsels of jove's inmost will to any god the oath was terrible <\s>
<s> then golden wanded brother ask me not to speak the fates by jupiter designed but be it mine to tell their various lot 725 to the unnumbered tribes of human kind <\s>
<s> let good to these and ill to those be wrought as i dispense but he who comes consigned by voice and wings of perfect augury to my great shrine shall find avail in me <\s>

<s> yet o son of may i have another wondrous thing to say <\s>
<s> there are three fates three virgin sisters who rejoicing in their wind outspeeding wings 740 their heads with flour snowed over white and new sit in a vale round which parnassus flings its circling skirts from these i have learned true vaticinations of remotest things <\s>
<s> my father cared not <\s>
<s> whilst they search out dooms 745 they sit apart and feed on honeycombs <\s>
<s> they having eaten the fresh honey grow drunk with divine enthusiasm and utter with earnest willingness the truth they know but if deprived of that sweet food they mutter 750 all plausible delusions these to you i give if you inquire they will not stutter delight your own soul with them any man you would instruct may profit if he can <\s>
<s> take these and the fierce oxen maia's child 755 o'er many a horse and toil enduring mule o'er jagged jawed lions and the wild white tusked boars o'er all by field or pool of cattle which the mighty mother mild nourishes in her bosom thou shalt rule 760 thou dost alone the veil from death uplift thou givest not yet this is a great gift <\s>
