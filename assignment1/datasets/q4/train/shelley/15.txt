<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>

<s> having said 270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind 275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285 and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering self compassion then his speech 290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm 295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen <\s>
<s> i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made <\s>
<s> month after month he cried to bear this load 300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair 305 but live and move and wretched thing <\s>
<s> smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas <\s>
<s> no scorn or pain or hate could be 310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their father ... would the dust 315 were covered in upon my body now <\s>
<s> that the life ceased to toil within my brow <\s>
<s> and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead <\s>
<s> what power delights to torture us <\s>
<s> i know 320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may <\s>
<s> none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again 325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth 330 had overlived hope's momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gained ... as one from dreaming 335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirit's mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see 340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friend's incommunicable woe <\s>
<s> ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade 345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust <\s>
<s> there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye <\s>
<s> love sometimes leads astray to misery <\s>
<s> yet think not though subdued and i may well 350 say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 355 which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain <\s>
<s> the dagger heals not but may rend again ... <\s>
<s> believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free 360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moment's shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain 365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust ... <\s>
<s> heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust <\s>
<s> till then the dungeon may demand its prey 370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that love devoted youth is ours let's sit beside him he may live some six months yet <\s>
<s> or the red scaffold as our country bends 375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now ... <\s>
<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>

<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>

<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>

<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>

<s> i must remove a veil from my pent mind <\s>
<s> o pallid as death's dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side 385 am i not wan like thee <\s>
<s> at the grave's call i haste invited to thy wedding ball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted me ... and made the tomb thy bridal bed ... but i beside your feet 390 will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet thus ... wide awake tho dead ... yet stay o stay <\s>
<s> go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasons ... i am mad i fear my fancy is o'erwrought ... thou art not here ... <\s>
<s> 395 pale art thou tis most true ... but thou art gone thy work is finished ... i am left alone ... <\s>
<s> nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent <\s>
<s> 400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content <\s>
<s> did not thy love awaken mine <\s>
<s> i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow 405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away <\s>
<s> you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expresses ... never one 410 humbled himself before as i have done <\s>
<s> even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies <\s>
<s> no wears a living death of agonies <\s>
<s> 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow ever moving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality <\s>
<s> that you had never seen me never heard 420 my voice and more than all had ne'er endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 425 with mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find 430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind ... <\s>
<s> thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory o'er them for i heard and can forget not ... they were ministered one after one those curses <\s>
<s> mix them up 435 like self destroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou ne'er didst imprecate for on me death <\s>
<s> it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel 440 of the mind's hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a stranger's tear might wear as water drops the sandy fountain stone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see 445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve o'er which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth 450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with love's too partial praise let none relent 455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seek ... for thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thus ... and thus ... i live to show how much men bear and die not <\s>
<s> thou wilt tell 460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could e'er address such features to love's work ... this taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue 465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defence ... for since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught 470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials <\s>
<s> how vain are words <\s>
<s> i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start 475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tears ... my sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into it ... blotting all things fair 480 and wise and good which time had written there <\s>
<s> those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child <\s>
<s> i would that thine were like to be more mild 485 for both our wretched sakes ... for thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory <\s>
<s> fear me not ... against thee i would not move a finger in despite <\s>
<s> do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve <\s>
<s> 495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain <\s>
<s> then when thou speakest of me never say 500 he could forgive not <\s>
<s> here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark 505 the grave is yawning ... as its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief ... the air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair <\s>
<s> 510 he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we 515 wept without shame in his society <\s>
<s> i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human nature ... then we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot 520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalo's yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill 525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 530 but in the light of all beholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess 535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lost ... it were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn <\s>
<s> the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made <\s>
<s> he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong 545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song <\s>
<s> if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea 550 and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair 555 which were twin born with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country <\s>
<s> i might sit in maddalo's great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night 560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief 565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart 570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate 575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed 580 made for long years impression on my mind <\s>
<s> the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice <\s>
<s> after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same 585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia <\s>
<s> his dog was dead <\s>
<s> his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth 590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeare's women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her father's friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferer's health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again <\s>
<s> her mien had been imperious but she now 600 looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low <\s>
<s> her coming made him better and they stayed together at my father's for i played as i remember with the lady's shawl i might be six years old but after all 605 she left him ... why her heart must have been tough how did it end <\s>
<s> and was not this enough <\s>
<s> they met they parted child is there no more <\s>
<s> something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met 610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie <\s>
<s> 615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know <\s>
<s> cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo <\s>
<s> what think you the dead are <\s>
<s> why dust and clay what should they be <\s>
<s> tis the last hour of day <\s>
<s> look on the west how beautiful it is 620 vaulted with radiant vapours <\s>
<s> the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud ... <\s>
<s> fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought 625 till it dies ... <\s>
<s> between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven <\s>
<s> but when not ... <\s>
<s> perhaps the only comfort which remains 630 is the unheeded clanking of my chains the which i make and call it melody <\s>
