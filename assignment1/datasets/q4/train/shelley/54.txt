<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>

<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>

<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>

<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>

<s> nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the death darting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a lead coloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep 50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn o'er the populous vessel <\s>
<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>

<s> but none ever trembled and panted with bliss in the garden the field or the wilderness 10 like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want as the companionless sensitive plant <\s>
<s> the snowdrop and then the violet arose from the ground with warm rain wet and their breath was mixed with fresh odour sent 15 from the turf like the voice and the instrument <\s>
<s> then the pied wind flowers and the tulip tall and narcissi the fairest among them all who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess till they die of their own dear loveliness 20 and the naiad like lily of the vale whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale that the light of its tremulous bells is seen through their pavilions of tender green and the hyacinth purple and white and blue 25 which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew of music so delicate soft and intense it was felt like an odour within the sense and the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast 30 till fold after fold to the fainting air the soul of her beauty and love lay bare and the wand like lily which lifted up as a maenad its moonlight coloured cup till the fiery star which is its eye gazed through clear dew on the tender sky 35 and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose the sweetest flower for scent that blows and all rare blossoms from every clime grew in that garden in perfect prime <\s>
<s> 40 and on the stream whose inconstant bosom was pranked under boughs of embowering blossom with golden and green light slanting through their heaven of many a tangled hue broad water lilies lay tremulously 45 and starry river buds glimmered by and around them the soft stream did glide and dance with a motion of sweet sound and radiance <\s>
<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>
<s> and from this undefiled paradise the flowers as an infant's awakening eyes smile on its mother whose singing sweet 60 can first lull and at last must awaken it when heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them as mine lamps enkindle a hidden gem shone smiling to heaven and every one 65 shared joy in the light of the gentle sun for each one was interpenetrated with the light and the odour its neighbour shed like young lovers whom youth and love make dear wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere <\s>
<s> but the sensitive plant which could give small fruit 70 of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root received more than all it loved more than ever where none wanted but it could belong to the giver for the sensitive plant has no bright flower radiance and odour are not its dower 75 it loves even like love its deep heart is full it desires what it has not the beautiful <\s>
<s> the light winds which from unsustaining wings shed the music of many murmurings the beams which dart from many a star 80 of the flowers whose hues they bear afar the plumed insects swift and free like golden boats on a sunny sea laden with light and odour which pass over the gleam of the living grass 85 the unseen clouds of the dew which lie like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high then wander like spirits among the spheres each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears the quivering vapours of dim noontide 90 which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide in which every sound and odour and beam move as reeds in a single stream each and all like ministering angels were for the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear 95 whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky <\s>
<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>

<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>

<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>

<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>

<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the rags of the sail are flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale from the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven and when lightning is loosed like a deluge from heaven she sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin 5 and bend as if heaven was ruining in which they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass as if ocean had sunk from beneath them they pass to their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound and the waves and the thunders made silent around 10 leave the wind to its echo <\s>
<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>
<s> in many a spire the pyramid billows with white points of brine in the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine as piercing the sky from the floor of the sea <\s>
<s> 25 the great ship seems splitting <\s>
<s> it cracks as a tree while an earthquake is splintering its root ere the blast of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed <\s>
<s> the intense thunder balls which are raining from heaven have shattered its mast and it stands black and riven <\s>
<s> 30 the chinks suck destruction <\s>
<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>
<s> meanwhile from the hold one deck is burst up by the waters below 35 and it splits like the ice when the thaw breezes blow o'er the lakes of the desert <\s>
<s> who sit on the other <\s>
<s> is that all the crew that lie burying each other like the dead in a breach round the foremast <\s>
<s> are those twin tigers who burst when the waters arose 40 in the agony of terror their chains in the hold what now makes them tame is what then made them bold ;) who crouch side by side and have driven like a crank the deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank are these all <\s>
<s> nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the death darting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a lead coloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep 50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn o'er the populous vessel <\s>
<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>
<s> one after one the mariners died on the eve of this day when the tempest was gathering in cloudy array 60 but seven remained <\s>
<s> six the thunder has smitten and they lie black as mummies on which time has written his scorn of the embalmer the seventh from the deck an oak splinter pierced through his breast and his back and hung out to the tempest a wreck on the wreck <\s>
<s> at the helm sits a woman more fair than heaven when unbinding its star braided hair it sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea <\s>
<s> she clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee it laughs at the lightning it mocks the mixed thunder 70 of the air and the sea with desire and with wonder it is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near it would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear is outshining the meteors its bosom beats high the heart fire of pleasure has kindled its eye 75 while its mother's is lustreless <\s>
<s> smile not my child but sleep deeply and sweetly and so be beguiled of the pang that awaits us whatever that be so dreadful since thou must divide it with me <\s>
<s> this pale bosom thy cradle and bed 80 will it rock thee not infant <\s>
<s> tis beating with dread <\s>
<s> what is life what is death what are we that when the ship sinks we no longer may be <\s>
<s> to see thee no more and to feel thee no more <\s>
<s> to be after life what we have been before <\s>
<s> 85 not to touch those sweet hands <\s>
<s> not to look on those eyes those lips and that hair all the smiling disguise thou yet wearest sweet spirit which i day by day have so long called my child but which now fades away like a rainbow and i the fallen shower lo <\s>
<s> but none ever trembled and panted with bliss in the garden the field or the wilderness 10 like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want as the companionless sensitive plant <\s>
<s> the snowdrop and then the violet arose from the ground with warm rain wet and their breath was mixed with fresh odour sent 15 from the turf like the voice and the instrument <\s>
<s> then the pied wind flowers and the tulip tall and narcissi the fairest among them all who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess till they die of their own dear loveliness 20 and the naiad like lily of the vale whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale that the light of its tremulous bells is seen through their pavilions of tender green and the hyacinth purple and white and blue 25 which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew of music so delicate soft and intense it was felt like an odour within the sense and the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast 30 till fold after fold to the fainting air the soul of her beauty and love lay bare and the wand like lily which lifted up as a maenad its moonlight coloured cup till the fiery star which is its eye gazed through clear dew on the tender sky 35 and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose the sweetest flower for scent that blows and all rare blossoms from every clime grew in that garden in perfect prime <\s>
<s> 40 and on the stream whose inconstant bosom was pranked under boughs of embowering blossom with golden and green light slanting through their heaven of many a tangled hue broad water lilies lay tremulously 45 and starry river buds glimmered by and around them the soft stream did glide and dance with a motion of sweet sound and radiance <\s>
<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>
<s> and from this undefiled paradise the flowers as an infant's awakening eyes smile on its mother whose singing sweet 60 can first lull and at last must awaken it when heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them as mine lamps enkindle a hidden gem shone smiling to heaven and every one 65 shared joy in the light of the gentle sun for each one was interpenetrated with the light and the odour its neighbour shed like young lovers whom youth and love make dear wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere <\s>
<s> but the sensitive plant which could give small fruit 70 of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root received more than all it loved more than ever where none wanted but it could belong to the giver for the sensitive plant has no bright flower radiance and odour are not its dower 75 it loves even like love its deep heart is full it desires what it has not the beautiful <\s>
<s> the light winds which from unsustaining wings shed the music of many murmurings the beams which dart from many a star 80 of the flowers whose hues they bear afar the plumed insects swift and free like golden boats on a sunny sea laden with light and odour which pass over the gleam of the living grass 85 the unseen clouds of the dew which lie like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high then wander like spirits among the spheres each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears the quivering vapours of dim noontide 90 which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide in which every sound and odour and beam move as reeds in a single stream each and all like ministering angels were for the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear 95 whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky <\s>
<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> there was a power in this sweet place an eve in this eden a ruling grace which to the flowers did they waken or dream was as god is to the starry scheme <\s>
<s> a lady the wonder of her kind 5 whose form was upborne by a lovely mind which dilating had moulded her mien and motion like a sea flower unfolded beneath the ocean tended the garden from morn to even and the meteors of that sublunar heaven 10 like the lamps of the air when night walks forth laughed round her footsteps up from the earth <\s>
<s> she had no companion of mortal race but her tremulous breath and her flushing face told whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes 15 that her dreams were less slumber than paradise as if some bright spirit for her sweet sake had deserted heaven while the stars were awake as if yet around her he lingering were though the veil of daylight concealed him from her <\s>
<s> 20 her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed you might hear by the heaving of her breast that the coming and going of the wind brought pleasure there and left passion behind <\s>

<s> i doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet 30 i doubt not they felt the spirit that came from her glowing fingers through all their frame <\s>
<s> she sprinkled bright water from the stream on those that were faint with the sunny beam and out of the cups of the heavy flowers 35 she emptied the rain of the thunder showers <\s>
<s> she lifted their heads with her tender hands and sustained them with rods and osier bands if the flowers had been her own infants she could never have nursed them more tenderly <\s>
<s> 40 and all killing insects and gnawing worms and things of obscene and unlovely forms she bore in a basket of indian woof into the rough woods far aloof in a basket of grasses and wild flowers full 45 the freshest her gentle hands could pull for the poor banished insects whose intent although they did ill was innocent <\s>
<s> but the bee and the beamlike ephemeris whose path is the lightning's and soft moths that kiss 50 the sweet lips of the flowers and harm not did she make her attendant angels be <\s>

<s> three days the flowers of the garden fair like stars when the moon is awakened were or the waves of baiae ere luminous she floats up through the smoke of vesuvius <\s>
<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>

<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>

<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>

<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>

<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the rags of the sail are flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale from the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven and when lightning is loosed like a deluge from heaven she sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin 5 and bend as if heaven was ruining in which they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass as if ocean had sunk from beneath them they pass to their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound and the waves and the thunders made silent around 10 leave the wind to its echo <\s>
<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>
<s> in many a spire the pyramid billows with white points of brine in the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine as piercing the sky from the floor of the sea <\s>
<s> 25 the great ship seems splitting <\s>
<s> it cracks as a tree while an earthquake is splintering its root ere the blast of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed <\s>
<s> the intense thunder balls which are raining from heaven have shattered its mast and it stands black and riven <\s>
<s> 30 the chinks suck destruction <\s>
<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>
<s> meanwhile from the hold one deck is burst up by the waters below 35 and it splits like the ice when the thaw breezes blow o'er the lakes of the desert <\s>
<s> who sit on the other <\s>
<s> is that all the crew that lie burying each other like the dead in a breach round the foremast <\s>
<s> are those twin tigers who burst when the waters arose 40 in the agony of terror their chains in the hold what now makes them tame is what then made them bold ;) who crouch side by side and have driven like a crank the deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank are these all <\s>
<s> nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the death darting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a lead coloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep 50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn o'er the populous vessel <\s>
<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>
<s> one after one the mariners died on the eve of this day when the tempest was gathering in cloudy array 60 but seven remained <\s>
<s> six the thunder has smitten and they lie black as mummies on which time has written his scorn of the embalmer the seventh from the deck an oak splinter pierced through his breast and his back and hung out to the tempest a wreck on the wreck <\s>
<s> at the helm sits a woman more fair than heaven when unbinding its star braided hair it sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea <\s>
<s> she clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee it laughs at the lightning it mocks the mixed thunder 70 of the air and the sea with desire and with wonder it is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near it would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear is outshining the meteors its bosom beats high the heart fire of pleasure has kindled its eye 75 while its mother's is lustreless <\s>
<s> smile not my child but sleep deeply and sweetly and so be beguiled of the pang that awaits us whatever that be so dreadful since thou must divide it with me <\s>
<s> this pale bosom thy cradle and bed 80 will it rock thee not infant <\s>
<s> tis beating with dread <\s>
<s> what is life what is death what are we that when the ship sinks we no longer may be <\s>
<s> to see thee no more and to feel thee no more <\s>
<s> to be after life what we have been before <\s>
<s> 85 not to touch those sweet hands <\s>
<s> not to look on those eyes those lips and that hair all the smiling disguise thou yet wearest sweet spirit which i day by day have so long called my child but which now fades away like a rainbow and i the fallen shower lo <\s>
<s> but none ever trembled and panted with bliss in the garden the field or the wilderness 10 like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want as the companionless sensitive plant <\s>
<s> the snowdrop and then the violet arose from the ground with warm rain wet and their breath was mixed with fresh odour sent 15 from the turf like the voice and the instrument <\s>
<s> then the pied wind flowers and the tulip tall and narcissi the fairest among them all who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess till they die of their own dear loveliness 20 and the naiad like lily of the vale whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale that the light of its tremulous bells is seen through their pavilions of tender green and the hyacinth purple and white and blue 25 which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew of music so delicate soft and intense it was felt like an odour within the sense and the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast 30 till fold after fold to the fainting air the soul of her beauty and love lay bare and the wand like lily which lifted up as a maenad its moonlight coloured cup till the fiery star which is its eye gazed through clear dew on the tender sky 35 and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose the sweetest flower for scent that blows and all rare blossoms from every clime grew in that garden in perfect prime <\s>
<s> 40 and on the stream whose inconstant bosom was pranked under boughs of embowering blossom with golden and green light slanting through their heaven of many a tangled hue broad water lilies lay tremulously 45 and starry river buds glimmered by and around them the soft stream did glide and dance with a motion of sweet sound and radiance <\s>
<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>
<s> and from this undefiled paradise the flowers as an infant's awakening eyes smile on its mother whose singing sweet 60 can first lull and at last must awaken it when heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them as mine lamps enkindle a hidden gem shone smiling to heaven and every one 65 shared joy in the light of the gentle sun for each one was interpenetrated with the light and the odour its neighbour shed like young lovers whom youth and love make dear wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere <\s>
<s> but the sensitive plant which could give small fruit 70 of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root received more than all it loved more than ever where none wanted but it could belong to the giver for the sensitive plant has no bright flower radiance and odour are not its dower 75 it loves even like love its deep heart is full it desires what it has not the beautiful <\s>
<s> the light winds which from unsustaining wings shed the music of many murmurings the beams which dart from many a star 80 of the flowers whose hues they bear afar the plumed insects swift and free like golden boats on a sunny sea laden with light and odour which pass over the gleam of the living grass 85 the unseen clouds of the dew which lie like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high then wander like spirits among the spheres each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears the quivering vapours of dim noontide 90 which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide in which every sound and odour and beam move as reeds in a single stream each and all like ministering angels were for the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear 95 whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky <\s>
<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> there was a power in this sweet place an eve in this eden a ruling grace which to the flowers did they waken or dream was as god is to the starry scheme <\s>
<s> a lady the wonder of her kind 5 whose form was upborne by a lovely mind which dilating had moulded her mien and motion like a sea flower unfolded beneath the ocean tended the garden from morn to even and the meteors of that sublunar heaven 10 like the lamps of the air when night walks forth laughed round her footsteps up from the earth <\s>
<s> she had no companion of mortal race but her tremulous breath and her flushing face told whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes 15 that her dreams were less slumber than paradise as if some bright spirit for her sweet sake had deserted heaven while the stars were awake as if yet around her he lingering were though the veil of daylight concealed him from her <\s>
<s> 20 her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed you might hear by the heaving of her breast that the coming and going of the wind brought pleasure there and left passion behind <\s>

<s> i doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet 30 i doubt not they felt the spirit that came from her glowing fingers through all their frame <\s>
<s> she sprinkled bright water from the stream on those that were faint with the sunny beam and out of the cups of the heavy flowers 35 she emptied the rain of the thunder showers <\s>
<s> she lifted their heads with her tender hands and sustained them with rods and osier bands if the flowers had been her own infants she could never have nursed them more tenderly <\s>
<s> 40 and all killing insects and gnawing worms and things of obscene and unlovely forms she bore in a basket of indian woof into the rough woods far aloof in a basket of grasses and wild flowers full 45 the freshest her gentle hands could pull for the poor banished insects whose intent although they did ill was innocent <\s>
<s> but the bee and the beamlike ephemeris whose path is the lightning's and soft moths that kiss 50 the sweet lips of the flowers and harm not did she make her attendant angels be <\s>

<s> three days the flowers of the garden fair like stars when the moon is awakened were or the waves of baiae ere luminous she floats up through the smoke of vesuvius <\s>
<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>

<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>

<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>

<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>

<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the rags of the sail are flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale from the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven and when lightning is loosed like a deluge from heaven she sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin 5 and bend as if heaven was ruining in which they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass as if ocean had sunk from beneath them they pass to their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound and the waves and the thunders made silent around 10 leave the wind to its echo <\s>
<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>
<s> in many a spire the pyramid billows with white points of brine in the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine as piercing the sky from the floor of the sea <\s>
<s> 25 the great ship seems splitting <\s>
<s> it cracks as a tree while an earthquake is splintering its root ere the blast of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed <\s>
<s> the intense thunder balls which are raining from heaven have shattered its mast and it stands black and riven <\s>
<s> 30 the chinks suck destruction <\s>
<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>
<s> meanwhile from the hold one deck is burst up by the waters below 35 and it splits like the ice when the thaw breezes blow o'er the lakes of the desert <\s>
<s> who sit on the other <\s>
<s> is that all the crew that lie burying each other like the dead in a breach round the foremast <\s>
<s> are those twin tigers who burst when the waters arose 40 in the agony of terror their chains in the hold what now makes them tame is what then made them bold ;) who crouch side by side and have driven like a crank the deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank are these all <\s>
<s> nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the death darting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a lead coloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep 50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn o'er the populous vessel <\s>
<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>
<s> one after one the mariners died on the eve of this day when the tempest was gathering in cloudy array 60 but seven remained <\s>
<s> six the thunder has smitten and they lie black as mummies on which time has written his scorn of the embalmer the seventh from the deck an oak splinter pierced through his breast and his back and hung out to the tempest a wreck on the wreck <\s>
<s> at the helm sits a woman more fair than heaven when unbinding its star braided hair it sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea <\s>
<s> she clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee it laughs at the lightning it mocks the mixed thunder 70 of the air and the sea with desire and with wonder it is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near it would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear is outshining the meteors its bosom beats high the heart fire of pleasure has kindled its eye 75 while its mother's is lustreless <\s>
<s> smile not my child but sleep deeply and sweetly and so be beguiled of the pang that awaits us whatever that be so dreadful since thou must divide it with me <\s>
<s> this pale bosom thy cradle and bed 80 will it rock thee not infant <\s>
<s> tis beating with dread <\s>
<s> what is life what is death what are we that when the ship sinks we no longer may be <\s>
<s> to see thee no more and to feel thee no more <\s>
<s> to be after life what we have been before <\s>
<s> 85 not to touch those sweet hands <\s>
<s> not to look on those eyes those lips and that hair all the smiling disguise thou yet wearest sweet spirit which i day by day have so long called my child but which now fades away like a rainbow and i the fallen shower lo <\s>
<s> but none ever trembled and panted with bliss in the garden the field or the wilderness 10 like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want as the companionless sensitive plant <\s>
<s> the snowdrop and then the violet arose from the ground with warm rain wet and their breath was mixed with fresh odour sent 15 from the turf like the voice and the instrument <\s>
<s> then the pied wind flowers and the tulip tall and narcissi the fairest among them all who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess till they die of their own dear loveliness 20 and the naiad like lily of the vale whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale that the light of its tremulous bells is seen through their pavilions of tender green and the hyacinth purple and white and blue 25 which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew of music so delicate soft and intense it was felt like an odour within the sense and the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast 30 till fold after fold to the fainting air the soul of her beauty and love lay bare and the wand like lily which lifted up as a maenad its moonlight coloured cup till the fiery star which is its eye gazed through clear dew on the tender sky 35 and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose the sweetest flower for scent that blows and all rare blossoms from every clime grew in that garden in perfect prime <\s>
<s> 40 and on the stream whose inconstant bosom was pranked under boughs of embowering blossom with golden and green light slanting through their heaven of many a tangled hue broad water lilies lay tremulously 45 and starry river buds glimmered by and around them the soft stream did glide and dance with a motion of sweet sound and radiance <\s>
<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>
<s> and from this undefiled paradise the flowers as an infant's awakening eyes smile on its mother whose singing sweet 60 can first lull and at last must awaken it when heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them as mine lamps enkindle a hidden gem shone smiling to heaven and every one 65 shared joy in the light of the gentle sun for each one was interpenetrated with the light and the odour its neighbour shed like young lovers whom youth and love make dear wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere <\s>
<s> but the sensitive plant which could give small fruit 70 of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root received more than all it loved more than ever where none wanted but it could belong to the giver for the sensitive plant has no bright flower radiance and odour are not its dower 75 it loves even like love its deep heart is full it desires what it has not the beautiful <\s>
<s> the light winds which from unsustaining wings shed the music of many murmurings the beams which dart from many a star 80 of the flowers whose hues they bear afar the plumed insects swift and free like golden boats on a sunny sea laden with light and odour which pass over the gleam of the living grass 85 the unseen clouds of the dew which lie like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high then wander like spirits among the spheres each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears the quivering vapours of dim noontide 90 which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide in which every sound and odour and beam move as reeds in a single stream each and all like ministering angels were for the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear 95 whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky <\s>
<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> there was a power in this sweet place an eve in this eden a ruling grace which to the flowers did they waken or dream was as god is to the starry scheme <\s>
<s> a lady the wonder of her kind 5 whose form was upborne by a lovely mind which dilating had moulded her mien and motion like a sea flower unfolded beneath the ocean tended the garden from morn to even and the meteors of that sublunar heaven 10 like the lamps of the air when night walks forth laughed round her footsteps up from the earth <\s>
<s> she had no companion of mortal race but her tremulous breath and her flushing face told whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes 15 that her dreams were less slumber than paradise as if some bright spirit for her sweet sake had deserted heaven while the stars were awake as if yet around her he lingering were though the veil of daylight concealed him from her <\s>
<s> 20 her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed you might hear by the heaving of her breast that the coming and going of the wind brought pleasure there and left passion behind <\s>

<s> i doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet 30 i doubt not they felt the spirit that came from her glowing fingers through all their frame <\s>
<s> she sprinkled bright water from the stream on those that were faint with the sunny beam and out of the cups of the heavy flowers 35 she emptied the rain of the thunder showers <\s>
<s> she lifted their heads with her tender hands and sustained them with rods and osier bands if the flowers had been her own infants she could never have nursed them more tenderly <\s>
<s> 40 and all killing insects and gnawing worms and things of obscene and unlovely forms she bore in a basket of indian woof into the rough woods far aloof in a basket of grasses and wild flowers full 45 the freshest her gentle hands could pull for the poor banished insects whose intent although they did ill was innocent <\s>
<s> but the bee and the beamlike ephemeris whose path is the lightning's and soft moths that kiss 50 the sweet lips of the flowers and harm not did she make her attendant angels be <\s>

<s> three days the flowers of the garden fair like stars when the moon is awakened were or the waves of baiae ere luminous she floats up through the smoke of vesuvius <\s>
<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>

<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>

<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>

<s> and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across 50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flow'rets which drooping as day drooped too 55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glow worm from the evening dew <\s>

<s> and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep 100 and the day's veil fell from the world of sleep and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness 105 only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant ); the sensitive plant was the earliest 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night <\s>

<s> and on the fourth the sensitive plant 5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death 10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffin plank the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone 15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan <\s>
<s> the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap 20 to make men tremble who never weep <\s>
<s> swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night <\s>
<s> 25 the rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below <\s>
<s> the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man <\s>
<s> and indian plants of scent and hue 30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay <\s>
<s> and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead 35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast <\s>
<s> and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem 40 which rotted into the earth with them <\s>
<s> the water blooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air <\s>
<s> 45 then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers <\s>
<s> between the time of the wind and the snow 50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the water snake's belly and the toad's back <\s>
<s> and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank 55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank <\s>
<s> and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue 60 livid and starred with a lurid dew <\s>
<s> and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated <\s>
<s> 65 spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like water snakes <\s>
<s> and hour by hour when the air was still 70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt <\s>
<s> and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit <\s>
<s> the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew 80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue <\s>
<s> for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more <\s>
<s> 85 for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles his breath was a chain which without a sound 90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariot throne by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone <\s>
<s> then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath <\s>
<s> 95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost <\s>
<s> and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare <\s>
<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thaw rain grew 105 and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff <\s>
<s> when winter had gone and spring came back 110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels <\s>
<s> whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat 115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say <\s>
<s> whether that lady's gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light 120 found sadness where it left delight i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream 125 it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery <\s>
<s> that garden sweet that lady fair 130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours are changed not they <\s>
<s> for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change their might 135 exceeds our organs which endure no light being themselves obscure <\s>

<s> the rags of the sail are flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale from the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven and when lightning is loosed like a deluge from heaven she sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin 5 and bend as if heaven was ruining in which they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass as if ocean had sunk from beneath them they pass to their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound and the waves and the thunders made silent around 10 leave the wind to its echo <\s>
<s> the vessel now tossed through the low trailing rack of the tempest is lost in the skirts of the thunder cloud now down the sweep of the wind cloven wave to the chasm of the deep it sinks and the walls of the watery vale 15 whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale dim mirrors of ruin hang gleaming about while the surf like a chaos of stars like a rout of death flames like whirlpools of fire flowing iron with splendour and terror the black ship environ 20 or like sulphur flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire in fountains spout o'er it <\s>
<s> in many a spire the pyramid billows with white points of brine in the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine as piercing the sky from the floor of the sea <\s>
<s> 25 the great ship seems splitting <\s>
<s> it cracks as a tree while an earthquake is splintering its root ere the blast of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed <\s>
<s> the intense thunder balls which are raining from heaven have shattered its mast and it stands black and riven <\s>
<s> 30 the chinks suck destruction <\s>
<s> the heavy dead hulk on the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold its corruption around it <\s>
<s> meanwhile from the hold one deck is burst up by the waters below 35 and it splits like the ice when the thaw breezes blow o'er the lakes of the desert <\s>
<s> who sit on the other <\s>
<s> is that all the crew that lie burying each other like the dead in a breach round the foremast <\s>
<s> are those twin tigers who burst when the waters arose 40 in the agony of terror their chains in the hold what now makes them tame is what then made them bold ;) who crouch side by side and have driven like a crank the deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank are these all <\s>
<s> nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the death darting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a lead coloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep 50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn o'er the populous vessel <\s>
<s> and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around 55 and the sharks and the dogfish their grave clothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness <\s>
<s> one after one the mariners died on the eve of this day when the tempest was gathering in cloudy array 60 but seven remained <\s>
<s> six the thunder has smitten and they lie black as mummies on which time has written his scorn of the embalmer the seventh from the deck an oak splinter pierced through his breast and his back and hung out to the tempest a wreck on the wreck <\s>
<s> at the helm sits a woman more fair than heaven when unbinding its star braided hair it sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea <\s>
<s> she clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee it laughs at the lightning it mocks the mixed thunder 70 of the air and the sea with desire and with wonder it is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near it would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear is outshining the meteors its bosom beats high the heart fire of pleasure has kindled its eye 75 while its mother's is lustreless <\s>
<s> smile not my child but sleep deeply and sweetly and so be beguiled of the pang that awaits us whatever that be so dreadful since thou must divide it with me <\s>
<s> this pale bosom thy cradle and bed 80 will it rock thee not infant <\s>
<s> tis beating with dread <\s>
<s> what is life what is death what are we that when the ship sinks we no longer may be <\s>
<s> to see thee no more and to feel thee no more <\s>
<s> to be after life what we have been before <\s>
<s> 85 not to touch those sweet hands <\s>
<s> not to look on those eyes those lips and that hair all the smiling disguise thou yet wearest sweet spirit which i day by day have so long called my child but which now fades away like a rainbow and i the fallen shower lo <\s>
