<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>

<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>

<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>

<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>

<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>

<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>

<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>

<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>

<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>

<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>

<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>

<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>

<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>

<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>

<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>

<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> west bank the west bank the larger of the two areas comprising the palestinian territories experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid the palestinian authority's pa implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the israeli government <\s>
<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>

<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>

<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>

<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>

<s> nevertheless overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 <\s>
<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>

<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>

<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>

<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>

<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>

<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>

<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>

<s> the almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of israeli closure policies a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the west bank in response to israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows industrial capacity and basic commerce both external and internal <\s>
<s> since 2008 the pa under president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance supported by more than 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the pa's budget since 2007 <\s>
<s> an easing of some israeli restrictions on west bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities <\s>
<s> the biggest impediments to economic improvements in the west bank remain palestinians lack of access to land and resources in israeli-controlled areas import and export restrictions and a high-cost capital structure <\s>
<s> absent robust private sector growth the pa will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs <\s>
<s> western sahara western sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries are fishing phosphate mining and pastoral nomadism <\s>
<s> the territory's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture difficult and wstern sahara imports much of its food <\s>
<s> the moroccan government administers western sahara's economy and is a source of employment infrstructure development and social spending in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between morocco and the polisario <\s>
<s> morocco and the eu in july 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing european vessels to fish off the coast of morocco including the disputed waters off the coast of western sahara <\s>
<s> oil has never been found in western sahara in commercially significant quantities but morocco and the polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory <\s>
<s> western sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory <\s>
<s> world in 2010 world output and per capita income began to recover from the 2008-09 recession the first global downturn since 1946 <\s>
<s> gross world product gwp grew 4.6 largely on the strength of rebounding exports which rose about 20 from the level of 2009 <\s>
<s> growth was not evenly distributed across countries however <\s>
<s> lower income countries those with per capita incomes below 30,000 per year averaged 6.3 growth while higher income countries with per capita incomes above 30,000 averaged just 2.8 growth <\s>
<s> and countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0 growth while those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4 growth <\s>
<s> among large economies china +10.1 taiwan +8.3 india +8.3 brazil +7.5 and south korea +6.1 recorded the biggest gdp gains china also became the world's largest exporter <\s>
<s> continuing uncertainties in mortgage and financial markets resulted in slower growth in japan +3.0 the us +2.8 and the european union +1.7 <\s>
<s> in 2010 global unemployment continued to creep upwards reaching 8.8 underemployment especially in the developing world remained much higher <\s>
<s> global gross fixed investment stabilized at about 23 of gwp after a significant drop in 2009 <\s>
<s> world trade appears to be returning to pre 2009 patterns with current account surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries <\s>
<s> world external debt however dropped again in 2010 about 5 from the 2009 level as many countries reduced borrowing <\s>
<s> many if not most countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> the global money supply both narrowly and broadly defined increased roughly 10 as countries tried to keep interest rates low the global budget deficit stablilized at roughly 3.5 trillion as countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt <\s>
<s> the international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world economy with a major new challenge together with several long-standing ones <\s>
<s> the fiscal stimulus packages put in place in 2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits government balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries <\s>
<s> treasuries issued new public debt totaling 5.5 trillion since 2008 to pay for the additional expenditures <\s>
<s> to keep interest rates low many central banks monetized that debt injecting large sums of money into the economies <\s>
<s> as economic activity picks up central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth <\s>
<s> at the same time governments will face the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability <\s>
<s> long-standing challenges the world faces are several <\s>
<s> the addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of underemployment pollution waste-disposal epidemics water-shortages famine over-fishing of oceans deforestation desertification and depletion of non-renewable resources <\s>
<s> the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology <\s>
<s> internally central governments often find their control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements typically based on ethnicity gain momentum e g in many of the successor states of the former soviet union in the former yugoslavia in india in iraq in indonesia and in canada <\s>
<s> externally central governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies most notably the eu <\s>
<s> the introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of western europe in january 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because the participating nations are culturally and politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of income and hence differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies <\s>
<s> in western europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment <\s>
<s> because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized <\s>
<s> the terrorist attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs <\s>
<s> wars in iraq and afghanistan added new uncertainties to global economic prospects <\s>
<s> despite these challenges the world economy also shows great promise <\s>
<s> technology has made possible further advances in all fields from agriculture to medicine alternative energy metallurgy and transportation <\s>
<s> improved global communications have greatly reduced the costs of international trade helping the world gain from the international division of labor raise living standards and reduce income disparities among nations <\s>
<s> much of the resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in concert to stem the financial onslaught knowing well the lessons of past economic failures <\s>
<s> yemen yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue <\s>
<s> petroleum accounts for roughly 25 of gdp and 70 of government revenue <\s>
<s> yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in october 2009 yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort <\s>
<s> in january 2010 the international community established the friends of yemen group that aims to support yemen's efforts towards economic and political reform and in august 2010 the imf approved a three-year 370 million program to further this effort <\s>
<s> despite these ambitious endeavors yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges including declining water resources and a high population growth rate <\s>
<s> zambia zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years with real gdp growth in 2005-08 about 6 per year <\s>
<s> privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth <\s>
<s> copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment <\s>
<s> in 2005 zambia qualified for debt relief under the highly indebted poor country initiative consisting of approximately usd 6 billion in debt relief <\s>
<s> poverty remains a significant problem in zambia despite a stronger economy <\s>
<s> declining world commodity prices and demand slowed gdp growth in 2008 but a sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped zambia recover <\s>
<s> lack of economic diversity subjects zambia to fluctuations in copper prices and in the weather <\s>
<s> zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems <\s>
<s> its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy <\s>
<s> the government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food products <\s>
<s> the eu and the us provide food aid on humanitarian grounds <\s>
<s> until early 2009 the reserve bank of zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit causing hyperinflation <\s>
<s> the power-sharing government formed in february 2009 has led to some economic improvements including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls <\s>
<s> the economy is registering its first growth in a decade but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth <\s>
