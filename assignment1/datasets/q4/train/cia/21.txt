<s> private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale workshops farming and services <\s>
<s> price controls subsidies and other rigidities weigh down the economy undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth <\s>
<s> significant informal market activity flourishes <\s>
<s> the legislature in late 2009 passed president mahmud ahmadi-nejad's bill to reduce subsidies particularly on food and energy <\s>
<s> the bill would phase out subsidies which benefit iran's upper and middle classes the most over three to five years and replace them with cash payments to iran's lower classes <\s>
<s> however the start of the program was delayed repeatedly throughout 2010 over fears of public reaction to higher prices <\s>
<s> this is the most extensive economic reform since the government implemented gasoline rationing in 2007 <\s>
<s> the recovery of world oil prices in the last year increased iran's oil export revenue by at least 10 billion over 2009 easing some of the financial impact of the newest round of international sanctions <\s>
