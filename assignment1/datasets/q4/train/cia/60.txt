<s> french law a type of civil law that is the legal system of france <\s>
<s> the french system also serves as the basis for or is mixed with other legal systems in approximately 50 countries notably in north africa the near east and the french territories and dependencies <\s>
<s> french law is primarily codified or systematic written civil law <\s>
<s> prior to the french revolution 1789-1799 france had no single national legal system <\s>
<s> laws in the northern areas of present-day france were mostly local customs based on privileges and exemptions granted by kings and feudal lords while in the southern areas roman law predominated <\s>
<s> the introduction of the napoleonic civil code during the reign of napoleon i in the first decade of the 19th century brought major reforms to the french legal system many of which remain part of france's current legal structure though all have been extensively amended or redrafted to address a modern nation <\s>
<s> french law distinguishes between public law and private law <\s>
<s> public law relates to government the french constitution public administration and criminal law <\s>

<s> islamic law the most widespread type of religious law it is the legal system enforced in over 30 countries particularly in the near east but also in central and south asia africa and indonesia <\s>
<s> in many countries islamic law operates in tandem with a civil law system <\s>
<s> islamic law is embodied in the sharia an arabic word meaning the right path <\s>
<s> sharia covers all aspects of public and private life and organizes them into five categories obligatory recommended permitted disliked and forbidden <\s>
<s> the primary sources of sharia law are the qur'an believed by muslims to be the word of god revealed to the prophet muhammad by the angel gabriel and the sunnah the teachings of the prophet and his works <\s>
<s> in addition to these two primary sources traditional sunni muslims recognize the consensus of muhammad's companions and islamic jurists on certain issues called ijmas and various forms of reasoning including analogy by legal scholars referred to as qiyas <\s>

<s> this legal system combined the teutonic civil law tradition of the northern provinces of france with the roman law tradition of the southern and eastern regions of the country <\s>
<s> the civil code bears similarities in its arrangement to the roman body of civil law see civil law above <\s>
<s> as enacted in 1804 the code addressed personal status property and the acquisition of property <\s>
<s> codes added over the following six years included civil procedures commercial law criminal law and procedures and a penal code <\s>
<s> religious law a legal system which stems from the sacred texts of religious traditions and in most cases professes to cover all aspects of life as a seamless part of devotional obligations to a transcendent imminent or deep philosophical reality <\s>
<s> implied as the basis of religious law is the concept of unalterability because the word of god cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments <\s>
<s> however a detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration <\s>
<s> the main types of religious law are sharia in islam halakha in judaism and canon law in some christian groups <\s>
<s> sharia is the most widespread religious legal system see islamic law and is the sole system of law for countries including iran the maldives and saudi arabia <\s>
<s> no country is fully governed by halakha but jewish people may decide to settle disputes through jewish courts and be bound by their rulings <\s>
<s> canon law is not a divine law as such because it is not found in revelation <\s>

<s> early roman law was drawn from custom and statutes later during the time of the empire emperors asserted their authority as the ultimate source of law <\s>
<s> the basis for roman laws was the idea that the exact form not the intention of words or of actions produced legal consequences <\s>
<s> it was only in the late 6th century a d <\s>
<s> that a comprehensive roman code of laws was published see civil law above <\s>
<s> roman law served as the basis of law systems developed in a number of continental european countries <\s>
