birth under 15 years 15-64 years 65 years and over and for the total population <\s>
<s> sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries <\s>
<s> for instance high sex ratios at birth in some asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons <\s>

<s> eventually it could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to find partners <\s>
