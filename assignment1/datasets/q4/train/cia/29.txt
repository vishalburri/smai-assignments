<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
<s> with unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption the government of prime minister mark rutte is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery <\s>

<s> industrial activity is predominantly in food processing chemicals petroleum refining and electrical machinery <\s>
<s> a highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports <\s>
<s> the netherlands along with 11 of its eu partners began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 <\s>
<s> the country has been one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the us <\s>
<s> after 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth the netherlands economy which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services was hard-hit by global economic crisis <\s>
<s> dutch gdp contracted 3.9 in 2009 while exports declined nearly 25 due to a sharp contraction in world demand <\s>
<s> the dutch financial sector has also suffered due in part to the high exposure of some dutch banks to u s <\s>
<s> in response to turmoil in financial markets the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third to prevent further systemic risk <\s>
<s> the government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers and expanding export credit facilities <\s>
<s> the stimulus programs and bank bailouts however resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 of gdp in 2009 and 5.6 in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 of gdp in 2008 <\s>
