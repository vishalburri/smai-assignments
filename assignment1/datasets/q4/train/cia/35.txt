to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>

sexual exploitation domestic servitude and forced labor in agriculture swazi girls particularly orphans are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude as well as to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

to south africa and mozambique swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in commercial agriculture and market vending some swazi women are forced into prostitution in south africa and mozambique after voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work tier rating tier 2 watch list the government of swaziland does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so the government believes that trafficking probably does occur but does not know the extent of the problem the government does not judge trafficking to be an important problem and chooses to direct its limited resources towards other issues a judgment which significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate human trafficking or to plan

<s> switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production <\s>
<s> the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the eu's in order to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector <\s>
<s> the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled <\s>
<s> the swiss national bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc <\s>
<s> switzerland's economy grew 2.8 in 2010 when bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges <\s>
<s> the country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09 leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 <\s>
<s> switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries the eu the us and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws <\s>
<s> consequently the government agreed to conform to oecd regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters including tax evasion <\s>
<s> the government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries including the us to incorporate the oecd standard and it is working with germany and the uk to resolve outsanding issues particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners <\s>
<s> parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements including that with the us in march 2010 but the agreements are subject to public referendum <\s>
<s> in 2009 swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at washington's behest the names of us account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud <\s>
