<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>
