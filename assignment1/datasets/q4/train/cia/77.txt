<s> islam the third of the monotheistic abrahamic faiths islam originated with the teachings of muhammad in the 7th century <\s>
<s> muslims believe muhammad is the final of all religious prophets beginning with abraham and that the qu'ran which is the islamic scripture was revealed to him by god <\s>
<s> islam derives from the word submission and obedience to god is a primary theme in this religion <\s>
<s> in order to live an islamic life believers must follow the five pillars or tenets of islam which are the testimony of faith shahada daily prayer salah giving alms zakah fasting during ramadan sawm and the pilgrimage to mecca hajj <\s>
<s> basic groupings the two primary branches of islam are sunni and shia which split from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about the rightful successor to muhammad <\s>
<s> the shia believe muhammad's cousin and son-in-law ali was the only divinely ordained imam religious leader while the sunni maintain the first three caliphs after muhammad were also legitimate authorities <\s>
<s> in modern islam sunnis and shia continue to have different views of acceptable schools of islamic jurisprudence and who is a proper islamic religious authority <\s>
<s> islam also has an active mystical branch sufism with various sunni and shia subsets <\s>
<s> sunni islam accounts for over 75 of the world's muslim population <\s>
<s> it recognizes the abu bakr as the first caliph after muhammad <\s>
<s> sunni has four schools of islamic doctrine and law hanafi maliki shafi'i and hanbali which uniquely interpret the hadith or recorded oral traditions of muhammad <\s>
<s> a sunni muslim may elect to follow any one of these schools as all are considered equally valid <\s>
<s> shia islam represents 10-20 of muslims worldwide and its distinguishing feature is its reverence for ali as an infallible divinely inspired leader and as the first imam of the muslim community after muhammad <\s>
<s> a majority of shia are known as twelvers because they believe that the 11 familial successor imams after muhammad culminate in a 12th imam al-mahdi who is hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the righteous <\s>
<s> variants ismaili faith a sect of shia islam its adherents are also known as seveners because they believe that the rightful seventh imam in islamic leadership was isma'il the elder son of imam jafar al-sadiq <\s>
<s> ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh imam as the mahdi or islamic messianic figure <\s>
<s> ismailis are located in various parts of the world particularly south asia and the levant <\s>
<s> alawi faith another shia sect of islam the name reflects followers devotion to the religious authority of ali <\s>
<s> alawites are a closed secretive religious group who assert they are shia muslims although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the middle east <\s>
<s> alawis live mostly in syria lebanon and turkey <\s>
<s> druze faith a highly secretive tradition and a closed community that derives from the ismaili sect of islam its core beliefs are thought to emphasize a combination of gnostic principles believing that the fatimid caliph al-hakin is the one who embodies the key aspects of goodness of the universe which are the intellect the word the soul the preceder and the follower <\s>
<s> the druze have a key presence in syria lebanon and israel <\s>
<s> jainism originating in india jain spiritual philosophy believes in an eternal human soul the eternal universe and a principle of the own nature of things <\s>
<s> it emphasizes compassion for all living things seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation through enlightenment and values personal responsibility due to the belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior <\s>
<s> jain philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for monks and laity alike its adherents are a highly influential religious minority in indian society <\s>
<s> judaism one of the first known monotheistic religions likely dating to between 2000-1500 b c judaism is the native faith of the jewish people based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility between a sole omnipotent creator god and abraham the patriarch of judaism's hebrew bible or tanakh <\s>
<s> divine revelation of principles and prohibitions in the hebrew scriptures form the basis of jewish law or halakhah which is a key component of the faith <\s>
<s> while there are extensive traditions of jewish halakhic and theological discourse there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition <\s>
<s> local communities have their own religious leadership <\s>
<s> modern judaism has three basic categories of faith orthodox conservative and reform liberal <\s>
<s> these differ in their views and observance of jewish law with the orthodox representing the most traditional practice and reform liberal communities the most accommodating of individualized interpretations of jewish identity and faith <\s>
<s> shintoism a native animist tradition of japan shinto practice is based upon the premise that every being and object has its own spirit or kami <\s>
<s> shinto practitioners worship several particular kamis including the kamis of nature and families often have shrines to their ancestors kamis <\s>
<s> shintoism has no fixed tradition of prayers or prescribed dogma but is characterized by individual ritual <\s>
<s> respect for the kamis in nature is a key shinto value <\s>
<s> prior to the end of world war ii shinto was the state religion of japan and bolstered the cult of the japanese emperor <\s>
<s> sikhism founded by the guru nanak born 1469 sikhism believes in a non-anthropomorphic supreme eternal creator god centering one's devotion to god is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of rebirth <\s>
<s> sikhs follow the teachings of nanak and nine subsequent gurus <\s>
<s> their scripture the guru granth sahib also known as the adi granth is considered the living guru or final authority of sikh faith and theology <\s>
<s> sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind and disavows caste class or gender discrimination <\s>
<s> taoism chinese philosophy or religion based upon lao tzu's tao te ching which centers on belief in the tao or the way as the flow of the universe and the nature of things <\s>

<s> taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a perfect harmonious balance and nature while in the manifest world particularly in the body balance is distorted <\s>
<s> the three jewels of the tao compassion simplicity and humility serve as the basis for taoist ethics <\s>
<s> zoroastrianism originating from the teachings of zoroaster in about the 9th or 10th century b c zoroastrianism may be the oldest continuing creedal religion <\s>
<s> its key beliefs center on a transcendent creator god ahura mazda and the concept of free will <\s>
<s> the key ethical tenets of zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture the avesta are based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent chaos if one chooses to serve god and exercises good thoughts good words and good deeds <\s>
<s> zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion and members are almost always born to zoroastrian parents <\s>
<s> prior to the spread of islam zoroastrianism dominated greater iran <\s>

if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age <\s>
<s> the total fertility rate tfr is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate since it refers to births per woman <\s>
<s> this indicator shows the potential for population change in the country <\s>
<s> a rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers <\s>
<s> rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining <\s>

<s> this indicator shows the potential for population change in the country <\s>
<s> a rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers <\s>
<s> rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining <\s>

<s> this indicator shows the potential for population change in the country <\s>
<s> a rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers <\s>
<s> rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining <\s>

<s> the total fertility rate tfr is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate since it refers to births per woman <\s>
<s> this indicator shows the potential for population change in the country <\s>
<s> a rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers <\s>
<s> rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining <\s>

if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age <\s>
<s> the total fertility rate tfr is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate since it refers to births per woman <\s>
<s> this indicator shows the potential for population change in the country <\s>
<s> a rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers <\s>
<s> rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining <\s>
<s> higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families in some situations to feed and educate their children and for women to enter the labor force <\s>
