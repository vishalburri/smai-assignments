<s> foker lady runnymede my dear was lady agatha milton you of course remember ); lady agnes will certainly invite him to logwood and far from being alarmed at his intimacy with her son who is a singular and humorous but most prudent and amiable young man to whom i am sure we are under every obligation for his admirable conduct in the affair of the fotheringay marriage i look upon it as one of the very luckiest things which could have happened to pen that he should have formed an intimacy with this most amusing young gentleman <\s>
<s> helen sighed she supposed the major knew best <\s>
<s> foker had been very kind in the wretched business with miss costigan certainly and she was grateful to him <\s>
<s> but she could not feel otherwise than a dim presentiment of evil and all these quarrels and riots and worldliness scared her about the fate of her boy <\s>
<s> doctor portman was decidedly of opinion that pen should go to college <\s>
<s> he hoped the lad would read and have a moderate indulgence of the best society too <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that pen would distinguish himself smirke spoke very highly of his proficiency the doctor himself had heard him construe and thought he acquitted himself remarkably well <\s>
<s> that he should go out of chatteris was a great point at any rate and pen who was distracted from his private grief by the various rows and troubles which had risen round about him gloomily said he would obey <\s>
<s> there were assizes races and the entertainments and the flux of company consequent upon them at chatteris during a part of the months of august and september and miss fotheringay still continued to act and take farewell of the audiences at the chatteris theatre during that time <\s>
<s> nobody seemed to be particularly affected by her presence or her announced departure except those persons whom we have named nor could the polite county folks who had houses in london and very likely admired the fotheringay prodigiously in the capital when they had been taught to do so by the fashion which set in in her favour find anything remarkable in the actress performing on the little chatteris boards <\s>
<s> many genius and many a quack for that matter has met with a similar fate before and since miss costigan's time <\s>
<s> this honest woman meanwhile bore up against the public neglect and any other crosses or vexations which she might have in life with her usual equanimity and ate drank acted slept with that regularity and comfort which belongs to people of her temperament <\s>
<s> what a deal of grief care and other harmful excitement does a healthy dulness and cheerful insensibility avoid <\s>
<s> nor do i mean to say that virtue is not virtue because it is never tempted to go astray only that dulness is a much finer gift than we give it credit for being and that some people are very lucky whom nature has endowed with a good store of that great anodyne <\s>
<s> pen used to go drearily in and out from the play at chatteris during this season and pretty much according to his fancy <\s>
<s> his proceedings tortured his mother not a little and her anxiety would have led her often to interfere had not the major constantly checked and at the same time encouraged her for the wily man of the world fancied he saw that a favourable turn had occurred in pen's malady <\s>
<s> it was the violent efflux of versification among other symptoms which gave pen's guardian and physician satisfaction <\s>
<s> he might be heard spouting verses in the shrubbery walks or muttering them between his teeth as he sat with the home party of evenings <\s>
<s> one day prowling about the house in pen's absence the major found a great book full of verses in the lad's study <\s>
<s> they were in english and in latin quotations from the classic authors were given in the scholastic manner in the foot notes <\s>
<s> he can't be very bad wisely thought the pall mall philosopher and he made pen's mother remark not perhaps without a secret feeling of disappointment for she loved romance like other soft women that the young gentleman during the last fortnight came home quite hungry to dinner at night and also showed a very decent appetite at the breakfast table in the morning <\s>
<s> gad i wish i could said the major thinking ruefully of his dinner pills <\s>
<s> the boy begins to sleep well depend upon that <\s>
<s> it was cruel but it was true <\s>
<s> having no other soul to confide in for he could not speak to his mother of his loves and disappointments his uncle treated them in a scornful and worldly tone which though carefully guarded and polite yet jarred greatly on the feelings of mr <\s>
<s> pen and foker was much too coarse to appreciate those refined sentimental secrets the lad's friendship for the curate redoubled or rather he was never tired of having smirke for a listener on that one subject <\s>
<s> what is a lovee without a confidant <\s>
<s> smirke as corydon does the elm tree to cut out his mistress's name upon <\s>
<s> he made him echo with the name of the beautiful amaryllis <\s>
<s> when men have left off playing the tune they do not care much for the pipe but pen thought he had a great friendship for smirke because he could sigh out his loves and griefs into his tutor's ears and smirke had his own reasons for always being ready at the lad's call <\s>
<s> pen's affection gushed out in a multitude of sonnets to the friend of his heart as he styled the curate which the other received with great sympathy <\s>
<s> he plied smirke with latin sapphics and alcaics <\s>
<s> the love songs multiplied under his fluent pen and smirke declared and believed that they were beautiful <\s>
<s> on the other hand pen expressed a boundless gratitude to think that heaven should have sent him such a friend at such a moment <\s>
<s> he presented his tutor with his best bound books and his gold guard chain and wanted him to take his double barrelled gun <\s>
<s> he went into chatteris and got a gold pencil case on credit for he had no money and indeed was still in debt to smirke for some of the fotheringay presents which he presented to smirke with an inscription indicative of his unalterable and eternal regard for the curate who of course was pleased with every mark of the boy's attachment <\s>
<s> the poor curate was naturally very much dismayed at the contemplated departure of his pupil <\s>
<s> when arthur should go smirke's occupation and delight would go too <\s>
<s> what pretext could he find for a daily visit to fairoaks and that kind word or glance from the lady there which was as necessary to the curate as the frugal dinner which madame fribsby served him <\s>
<s> arthur gone he would only be allowed to make visits like any other acquaintance little laura could not accommodate him by learning the catechism more than once a week he had curled himself like ivy round fairoaks he pined at the thought that he must lose his hold of the place <\s>
<s> should he speak his mind and go down on his knees to the widow <\s>
<s> he thought over any indications in her behaviour which flattered his hopes <\s>
<s> she had praised his sermons three weeks before she had thanked him exceedingly for his present of a melon for a small dinner party which mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis gave she said she should always be grateful to him for his kindness to arthur and when he declared that there were no bounds to his love and affection for that dear boy she had certainly replied in a romantic manner indicating her own strong gratitude and regard to all her son's friends <\s>
<s> should he speak out or should he delay <\s>
<s> if he spoke and she refused him it was awful to think that the gate of fairoaks might be shut upon him for ever and within that door lay all the world for mr <\s>
<s> thus oh friendly readers we see how every man in the world has his own private griefs and business by which he is more cast down or occupied than by the affairs or sorrows of any other person <\s>
<s> pendennis is disquieting herself about losing her son and that anxious hold she has had of him as long as he has remained in the mother's nest whence he is about to take flight into the great world beyond while the major's great soul chafes and frets inwardly vexed as he thinks what great parties are going on in london and that he might be sunning himself in the glances of dukes and duchesses but for those cursed affairs which keep him in a wretched little country hole while pen is tossing between his passion and a more agreeable sensation unacknowledged yet but swaying him considerably namely his longing to see the world mr <\s>

<s> let us return however to the solitary smirke <\s>
<s> smirke had one confidante for his passion that most injudicious woman madame fribsby <\s>
<s> how she became madame fribsby nobody knows she had left clavering to go to a milliner's in london as miss fribsby she pretended that she had got the rank in paris during her residence in that city <\s>
<s> but how could the french king were he ever so much disposed give her any such title <\s>
<s> we shall not inquire into this mystery however <\s>
<s> suffice to say she went away from home a bouncing young lass she returned a rather elderly character with a madonna front and a melancholy countenance bought the late mrs <\s>
<s> harbottle's business for a song took her elderly mother to live with her was very good to the poor was constant at church and had the best of characters <\s>
<s> but there was no one in all clavering not mrs <\s>
<s> portman herself who read so many novels as madame fribsby <\s>
<s> she had plenty of time for this amusement for in truth very few people besides the folks at the rectory and fairoaks employed her and by a perpetual perusal of such works which were by no means so moral or edifying in the days of which we write as they are at present she had got to be so absurdly sentimental that in her eyes life was nothing but an immense love match and she never could see two people together but she fancied they were dying for one another <\s>
<s> on the day after mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's visit to the curate which we have recorded many pages back madame fribsby settled in her mind that mr <\s>
<s> smirke must be in love with the widow and did everything in her power to encourage this passion on both sides <\s>
<s> pendennis she very seldom saw indeed except in public and in her pew at church <\s>
<s> that lady had very little need of millinery or made most of her own dresses and caps but on the rare occasions when madame fribsby received visits from mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis or paid her respects at fairoaks she never failed to entertain the widow with praises of the curate pointing out what an angelical man he was how gentle how studious how lonely and she would wonder that no lady would take pity upon him <\s>
<s> helen laughed at these sentimental remarks and wondered that madame herself did not compassionate her lodger and console him <\s>
<s> madame fribsby shook her madonna front mong cure a boco souffare she said laying her hand on the part she designated as her cure <\s>
