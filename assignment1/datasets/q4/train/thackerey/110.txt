<s> lightfoot as she said had kept his counsel he called for more wine of mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot and at the end of this symposium both being greatly excited went into mrs <\s>
<s> she was there taking tea with her friend madame fribsby and lightfoot was by this time in such a happy state as not to be surprised at anything which might occur so that when altamont shook hands with mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot as an old acquaintance the recognition did not appear to him to be in the least strange but only a reasonable cause for further drinking <\s>
<s> the gentlemen partook then of brandy and water which they offered to the ladies not heeding the terrified looks of one or the other <\s>
<s> whilst they were so engaged at about six o'clock in the evening mr <\s>
<s> morgan sir francis clavering's new man came in and was requested to drink <\s>
<s> he selected his favourite beverage and the parties engaged in general conversation <\s>
<s> after a while mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot began to doze <\s>
<s> morgan had repeatedly given hints to mrs <\s>
<s> fribsby to quit the premises but that lady strangely fascinated and terrified it would seem or persuaded by mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot not to go kept her place <\s>
<s> her persistence occasioned much annoyance to mr <\s>
<s> morgan who vented his displeasure in such language as gave pain to mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot and caused mr <\s>
<s> altamont to say that he was a rum customer and not polite to the sex <\s>
<s> the altercation between the two gentlemen became very painful to the women especially to mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot who did everything to soothe mr <\s>
<s> morgan and under pretence of giving a pipe light to the stranger she handed him a paper on which she had privily written the words he knows you <\s>
<s> there may have been something suspicious in her manner of handing or in her guest's of reading the paper for when he got up a short time afterwards and said he would go to bed morgan rose too with a laugh and said it was too early to go to bed <\s>
<s> the stranger then said he would go to his bedroom <\s>
<s> morgan said he would show him the way <\s>
<s> at this the guest said come up <\s>
<s> i've got a brace of pistols up there to blow out the brains of any traitor or skulking spy and glared so fiercely upon morgan that the latter seizing hold of lightfoot by the collar and waking him said john amory i arrest you in the queen's name <\s>
<s> stand by me lightfoot <\s>
<s> this capture is worth a thousand pounds <\s>
<s> he put forward his hand as if to seize his prisoner but the other doubling his fist gave morgan with his left hand so fierce a blow on the chest that it knocked him back behind mr <\s>
<s> that gentleman who was athletic and courageous said he would knock his guest's head off and prepared to do so as the stranger tearing off his coat and cursing both of his opponents roared to them to come on <\s>
<s> but with a piercing scream mrs <\s>
<s> lightfoot flung herself before her husband whilst with another and louder shriek madame fribsby ran to the stranger and calling out armstrong johnny armstrong <\s>
<s> seized hold of his naked arm on which a blue tattooing of a heart and m <\s>
<s> the ejaculation of madame fribsby seemed to astound and sober the stranger <\s>
<s> he looked down upon her and cried out it's polly by jove <\s>
<s> fribsby continued to exclaim this is not amory <\s>
<s> this is johnny armstrong my wicked wicked husband married to me in st <\s>
<s> martin's church mate on board an indiaman and he left me two months after the wicked wretch <\s>
<s> this is john armstrong here's the mark on his arm which he made for me <\s>
<s> the stranger said i am john armstrong sure enough polly <\s>
<s> i'm john armstrong amory altamont and let em all come on and try what they can do against a british sailor <\s>
<s> hurray who's for it <\s>
<s> morgan still called out arrest him <\s>
<s> lightfoot said arrest him <\s>
<s> arrest you you mean spy <\s>
<s> stop the marriage and ruin my lady and take away the clavering arms from us <\s>
<s> did he say he'd take away the clavering arms from us <\s>
<s> hang him i'll throttle him <\s>
<s> keep him darling till the coach passes to the up train <\s>
<s> it'll be here now directly <\s>
<s> d him i'll choke him if he stirs said lightfoot <\s>
<s> and so they kept morgan until the coach came and mr <\s>
<s> amory or armstrong went away back to london <\s>
<s> morgan had followed him but of this event arthur pendennis did not inform lady clavering and left her invoking blessings upon him at her son's door going to kiss him as he was asleep <\s>
<s> it had been a busy day <\s>
<s> we have to chronicle the events of but one day more and that was a day when mr <\s>
<s> arthur attired in a new hat a new blue frock coat and blue handkerchief in a new fancy waistcoat new boots and new shirt studs presented by the right honourable the countess dowager of rockminster made his appearance at a solitary breakfast table in clavering park where he could scarce eat a single morsel of food <\s>
<s> two letters were laid by his worship's plate and he chose to open the first which was in a round clerk like hand in preference to the second more familiar superscription <\s>
<s> note 1 ran as follows garbanzos wine company shepherd's inn monday <\s>
<s> my dear pendennis in congratulating you heartily upon the event which is to make you happy for life i send my very kindest remembrances to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis whom i hope to know even longer than i have already known her <\s>
<s> and when i call her attention to the fact that one of the most necessary articles to her husband's comfort is pure sherry i know i shall have her for a customer for your worship's sake <\s>
<s> but i have to speak to you of other than my own concerns <\s>
<s> yesterday afternoon a certain j <\s>
<s> arrived at my chambers from clavering which he had left under circumstances of which you are doubtless now aware <\s>
<s> in spite of our difference i could not but give him food and shelter and he partook freely both of the garbanzos amontillado and the toboso ham and he told me what had happened to him and many other surprising adventures <\s>
<s> the rascal married at sixteen and has repeatedly since performed that ceremony in sydney in new zealand in south america in newcastle he says first before he knew our poor friend the milliner <\s>
<s> he is a perfect don juan <\s>
<s> and it seemed as if the commendatore had at last overtaken him for as we were at our meal there came three heavy knocks at my outer door which made our friend start <\s>
<s> i have sustained a siege or two here and went to my usual place to reconnoitre <\s>
<s> thank my stars i have not a bill out in the world and besides those gentry do not come in that way <\s>
<s> i found that it was your uncle's late valet morgan and a policeman i think a sham policeman and they said they had a warrant to take the person of john armstrong alias amory alias altamont a runaway convict and threatened to break in the oak <\s>
<s> now sir in my own days of captivity i had discovered a little passage along the gutter into bows and costigan's window and i sent jack alias along this covered way not without terror of his life for it had grown very cranky and then after a parley let in mons <\s>
<s> the rascal had been instructed about that covered way for he made for the room instantly telling the policeman to go downstairs and keep the gate and he charged up my little staircase as if he had known the premises <\s>
<s> as he was going out of the window we heard a voice that you know from bows's garret saying who are ye and hwhat the divvle are ye at <\s>
<s> you'd betther leave the gutther bedad there's a man killed himself already <\s>
<s> and as morgan crossing over and looking into the darkness was trying to see whether this awful news was true he took a broomstick and with a vigorous dash broke down the pipe of communication and told me this morning with great glee that he was reminded of that aisy sthratagem by remembering his dorling emilie when she acted the pawrt of cora in the plee and by the bridge in pezawro bedad <\s>
<s> i wish that scoundrel morgan had been on the bridge when the general tried his sthratagem <\s>
<s> if i hear more of jack alias i will tell you <\s>
<s> he has got plenty of money still and i wanted him to send some to our poor friend the milliner but the scoundrel laughed and said he had no more than he wanted but offered to give anybody a lock of his hair <\s>
<s> and believe me always truly yours e <\s>
