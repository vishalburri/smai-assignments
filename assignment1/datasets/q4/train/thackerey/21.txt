<s> in fact pen had written a note to his adversary of the day before telling him that if after the chastisement which his insolence richly deserved he felt inclined to ask the reparation which was usually given amongst gentlemen mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis's friend mr <\s>
<s> henry foker was empowered to make any arrangements for the satisfaction of mr <\s>
<s> and so he sent you with the answer did he sir <\s>
<s> foker said surveying the schoolmaster in his black coat and clerical costume <\s>
<s> if he had accepted this wicked challenge i should have flogged him mr <\s>
<s> wapshot said and gave mr <\s>
<s> foker a glance which seemed to say and i should like very much to flog you too <\s>
<s> uncommon kind of you sir i'm sure said pen's emissary <\s>
<s> i told my principal that i didn't think the other man would fight he continued with a great air of dignity <\s>

<s> nobody is in the great pew of the clavering family except the statues of defunct baronets and their ladies there is sir poyntz clavering knight and baronet kneeling in a square beard opposite his wife in a ruff a very fat lady the dame rebecca clavering in alto relievo is borne up to heaven by two little blue veined angels who seem to have a severe task and so forth <\s>
<s> how well in after life pen remembered those effigies and how often in youth he scanned them as the doctor was grumbling the sermon from the pulpit and smirke's mild head and forehead curl peered over the great prayer book in the desk <\s>
<s> the fairoaks folks were constant at the old church their servants had a pew so had the doctor's so had wapshot's and those of misses finucane's establishment three maids and a very nice looking young man in a livery <\s>
<s> the wapshot family were numerous and faithful <\s>
<s> glanders and his children regularly came to church so did one of the apothecaries <\s>
<s> pybus went turn and turn about to the low town church and to the abbey the charity school and their families of course came wapshot's boys made a good cheerful noise scuffling with their feet as they marched into church and up the organ loft stair and blowing their noses a good deal during the service <\s>
<s> to be brief the congregation looked as decent as might be in these bad times <\s>
<s> the abbey church was furnished with a magnificent screen and many hatchments and heraldic tombstones <\s>
<s> the doctor spent a great part of his income in beautifying his darling place he had endowed it with a superb painted window bought in the netherlands and an organ grand enough for a cathedral <\s>
<s> but in spite of organ and window in consequence of the latter very likely which had come out of a papistical place of worship and was blazoned all over with idolatry clavering new church prospered scandalously in the teeth of orthodoxy and many of the doctor's congregation deserted to mr <\s>
<s> simcoe and the honourable woman his wife <\s>
<s> their efforts had thinned the very ebenezer hard by them which building before simcoe's advent used to be so full that you could see the backs of the congregation squeezing out of the arched windows thereof <\s>
<s> simcoe's tracts fluttered into the doors of all the doctor's cottages and were taken as greedily as honest mrs <\s>
<s> portman's soup with the quality of which the graceless people found fault <\s>
<s> with the folks at the ribbon factory situated by the weir on the brawl side and round which the low town had grown orthodoxy could make no way at all <\s>
<s> quiet miss myra was put out of court by impetuous mrs <\s>
<s> simcoe and her female aides de camp <\s>
<s> ah it was a hard burthen for the doctor's lady to bear to behold her husband's congregation dwindling away to give the precedence on the few occasions when they met to a notorious low churchman's wife who was the daughter of an irish peer to know that there was a party in clavering their own town of clavering on which her doctor spent a great deal more than his professional income who held him up to odium because he played a rubber at whist and pronounced him to be a heathen because he went to the play <\s>
<s> in her grief she besought him to give up the play and the rubber indeed they could scarcely get a table now so dreadful was the outcry against the sport but the doctor declared that he would do what he thought right and what the great and good george the third did whose chaplain he had been ): and as for giving up whist because those silly folks cried out against it he would play dummy to the end of his days with his wife and myra rather than yield to their despicable persecutions <\s>
<s> of the two families owners of the factory which had spoiled the brawl as a trout stream and brought all the mischief into the town the senior partner mr <\s>
<s> rolt went to ebenezer the junior mr <\s>
<s> barker to the new church <\s>
<s> in a word people quarrelled in this little place a great deal more than neighbours do in london and in the book club which the prudent and conciliating pendennis had set up and which ought to have been a neutral territory they bickered so much that nobody scarcely was ever seen in the reading room except smirke who though he kept up a faint amity with the simcoe faction had still a taste for magazines and light worldly literature and old glanders whose white head and grizzly moustache might be seen at the window and of course little mrs <\s>
<s> pybus who looked at everybody's letters as the post brought them for the clavering reading room as every one knows used to be held at baker's library london street formerly hog lane and read every advertisement in the paper <\s>
<s> it may be imagined how great a sensation was created in this amiable little community when the news reached it of mr <\s>
<s> pen's love passages at chatteris <\s>
<s> it was carried from house to house and formed the subject of talk at high church low church and no church tables it was canvassed by the misses finucane and their teachers and very likely debated by the young ladies in the dormitories for what we know wapshot's big boys had their version of the story and eyed pen curiously as he sate in his pew at church or raised the finger of scorn at him as he passed through chatteris <\s>
<s> they always hated him and called him lord pendennis because he did not wear corduroys as they did and rode a horse and gave himself the airs of a buck <\s>
<s> and if the truth must be told it was mrs <\s>
<s> portman herself who was the chief narrator of the story of pen's loves <\s>
<s> whatever tales this candid woman heard she was sure to impart them to her neighbours and after she had been put into possession of pen's secret by the little scandal at chatteris poor doctor portman knew that it would next day be about the parish of which he was the rector <\s>
<s> and so indeed it was the whole society there had the legend at the news room at the milliner's at the shoe shop and the general warehouse at the corner of the market at mrs <\s>
<s> pybus's at the glanders's at the honourable mrs <\s>
<s> simcoe's soiree at the factory nay through the mill itself the tale was current in a few hours and young arthur pendennis's madness was in every mouth <\s>
<s> portman's acquaintances barked out upon him when he walked the street the next day <\s>
<s> the poor divine knew that his betsy was the author of the rumour and groaned in spirit <\s>
<s> well well it must have come in a day or two and it was as well that the town should have the real story <\s>
<s> what the clavering folks thought of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis for spoiling her son and of that precocious young rascal of an arthur for daring to propose to a play actress need not be told here <\s>
<s> if pride exists amongst any folks in our country and assuredly we have enough of it there is no pride more deep seated than that of twopenny old gentlewomen in small towns <\s>
<s> gracious goodness the cry was how infatuated the mother is about that pert and headstrong boy who gives himself the airs of a lord on his blood horse and for whom our society is not good enough and who would marry an odious painted actress off a booth where very likely he wants to rant himself <\s>
<s> if dear good mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had been alive this scandal would never have happened <\s>
<s> no more it would very likely nor should we have been occupied in narrating pen's history <\s>
<s> it was true that he gave himself airs to the clavering folks <\s>
<s> naturally haughty and frank their cackle and small talk and small dignities bored him and he showed a contempt which he could not conceal <\s>
<s> the doctor and the curate were the only people pen cared for in the place even mrs <\s>
<s> portman shared in the general distrust of him and of his mother the widow who kept herself aloof from the village society and was sneered at accordingly because she tried forsooth to keep her head up with the great county families <\s>
<s> barker at the factory has four times the butcher's meat that goes up to fairoaks with all their fine airs <\s>
<s> etc let the reader fill up these details according to his liking and experience of village scandal <\s>
<s> they will suffice to show how it was that a good woman occupied solely in doing her duty to her neighbour and her children and an honest brave lad impetuous and full of good and wishing well to every mortal alive found enemies and detractors amongst people to whom they were superior and to whom they had never done anything like harm <\s>
<s> the clavering curs were yelping all round the house of fairoaks and delighted to pull pen down <\s>
<s> doctor portman and smirke were both cautious of informing the widow of the constant outbreak of calumny which was pursuing poor pen though glanders who was a friend of the house kept him au courant <\s>
<s> it may be imagined what his indignation was was there any man in the village whom he could call to account <\s>
<s> presently some wags began to chalk up fotheringay for ever <\s>
<s> and other sarcastic allusions to late transactions at fairoaks gate <\s>
<s> another brought a large playbill from chatteris and wafered it there one night <\s>
<s> on one occasion pen riding through the lower town fancied he heard the factory boys jeer him and finally going through the doctor's gate into the churchyard where some of wapshot's boys were lounging the biggest of them a young gentleman about twenty years of age son of a neighbouring small squire who lived in the doubtful capacity of parlour boarder with mr <\s>
<s> wapshot flung himself into a theatrical attitude near a newly made grave and began repeating hamlet's verses over ophelia with a hideous leer at pen <\s>
<s> the young fellow was so enraged that he rushed at hobnell major with a shriek very much resembling an oath cut him furiously across the face with the riding whip which he carried flung it away calling upon the cowardly villain to defend himself and in another minute knocked the bewildered young ruffian into the grave which was just waiting for a different lodger <\s>
<s> then with his fists clenched and his face quivering with passion and indignation he roared out to mr <\s>
<s> hobnell's gaping companions to know if any of the blackguards would come on <\s>
<s> but they held back with a growl and retreated as doctor portman came up to his wicket and mr <\s>
<s> hobnell with his nose and lip bleeding piteously emerged from the grave <\s>
<s> pen looking death and defiance at the lads who retreated towards their side of the churchyard walked back again through the doctor's wicket and was interrogated by that gentleman <\s>
<s> the young fellow was so agitated he could scarcely speak <\s>
<s> his voice broke into a sob as he answered <\s>
<s> the coward insulted me sir he said and the doctor passed over the oath and respected the emotion of the honest suffering young heart <\s>
<s> pendennis the elder who like a real man of the world had a proper and constant dread of the opinion of his neighbour was prodigiously annoyed by the absurd little tempest which was blowing in chatteris and tossing about master pen's reputation <\s>
<s> doctor portman and captain glanders had to support the charges of the whole chatteris society against the young reprobate who was looked upon as a monster of crime <\s>
<s> pen did not say anything about the churchyard scuffle at home but went over to baymouth and took counsel with his friend harry foker esq who drove over his drag presently to the clavering arms whence he sent stoopid with a note to thomas hobnell esq at the rev <\s>
<s> wapshot's and a civil message to ask when he should wait upon that gentleman <\s>
<s> stoopid brought back word that the note had been opened by mr <\s>
<s> hobnell and read to half a dozen of the big boys on whom it seemed to make a great impression and that after consulting together and laughing mr <\s>
<s> hobnell said he would send an answer arter arternoon school which the bell was a ringing and mr <\s>
<s> wapshot he came out in his master's gownd <\s>
<s> stoopid was learned in academical costume having attended mr <\s>
<s> foker went out to see the curiosities of clavering meanwhile but not having a taste for architecture doctor portman's fine church did not engage his attention much and he pronounced the tower to be as mouldy as an old stilton cheese <\s>
<s> he walked down the street and looked at the few shops there he saw captain glanders at the window of the reading room and having taken a good stare at that gentleman he wagged his head at him in token of satisfaction he inquired the price of meat at the butcher's with an air of the greatest interest and asked when was next killing day <\s>
<s> he flattened his little nose against madame fribsby's window to see if haply there was a pretty workwoman in her premises but there was no face more comely than the doll's or dummy's wearing the french cap in the window only that of madame fribsby herself dimly visible in the parlour reading a novel <\s>
<s> that object was not of sufficient interest to keep mr <\s>
<s> foker very long in contemplation and so having exhausted the town and the inn stables in which there were no cattle save the single old pair of posters that earned a scanty livelihood by transporting the gentry round about to the county dinners mr <\s>
