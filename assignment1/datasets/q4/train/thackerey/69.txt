<s> this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment <\s>
<s> mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them <\s>
<s> he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering <\s>

<s> mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humour knew no bounds <\s>
<s> she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive <\s>
<s> as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ball ah how ghastly they looked <\s>
<s> that admirable and devoted major above all who had been for hours by lady clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering oh <\s>
<s> what an object he was <\s>
<s> the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl <\s>

<s> the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rose coloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale <\s>

<s> this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment <\s>
<s> mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them <\s>
<s> he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering <\s>

<s> mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humour knew no bounds <\s>
<s> she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive <\s>
<s> as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ball ah how ghastly they looked <\s>
<s> that admirable and devoted major above all who had been for hours by lady clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering oh <\s>
<s> what an object he was <\s>
<s> the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl <\s>

<s> the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rose coloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale <\s>

<s> this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment <\s>
<s> mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them <\s>
<s> he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering <\s>

<s> mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humour knew no bounds <\s>
<s> she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive <\s>
<s> as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ball ah how ghastly they looked <\s>
<s> that admirable and devoted major above all who had been for hours by lady clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering oh <\s>
<s> what an object he was <\s>
<s> the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl <\s>

<s> the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rose coloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale <\s>

<s> this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment <\s>
<s> mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them <\s>
<s> he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering <\s>

<s> mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humour knew no bounds <\s>
<s> she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive <\s>
<s> as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ball ah how ghastly they looked <\s>
<s> that admirable and devoted major above all who had been for hours by lady clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering oh <\s>
<s> what an object he was <\s>
<s> the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl <\s>

<s> the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rose coloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale <\s>

<s> blanche had read it the language of the eyes expressed her admiration and rapture at the performance <\s>
<s> this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment <\s>
<s> mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them <\s>
<s> he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering <\s>
<s> did he now really <\s>
<s> mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her good humour knew no bounds <\s>
<s> she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the major her contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive <\s>
<s> as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ball ah how ghastly they looked <\s>
<s> that admirable and devoted major above all who had been for hours by lady clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering oh <\s>
<s> what an object he was <\s>
<s> the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl <\s>
<s> there he stood with admirable patience enduring uncomplainingly a silent agony knowing that people could see the state of his face for could he not himself perceive the condition of others males and females of his own age longing to go to rest for hours past aware that suppers disagreed with him and yet having eaten a little so as to keep his friend lady clavering in good humour with twinges of rheumatism in the back and knees with weary feet burning in his varnished boots so tired oh so tired and longing for bed <\s>
<s> if a man struggling with hardship and bravely overcoming it is an object of admiration for the gods that power in whose chapels the old major was a faithful worshipper must have looked upwards approvingly upon the constancy of pendennis's martyrdom <\s>
<s> there are sufferers in that cause as in the other the negroes in the service of mumbo jumbo tattoo and drill themselves with burning skewers with great fortitude and we read that the priests in the service of baal gashed themselves and bled freely <\s>
<s> you who can smash the idols do so with a good courage but do not be too fierce with the idolaters they worship the best thing they know <\s>
<s> the pendennises the elder and the younger waited with lady clavering and her daughter until her ladyship's carriage was announced when the elder's martyrdom may be said to have come to an end for the good natured begum insisted upon leaving him at his door in bury street so he took the back seat of the carriage after a feeble bow or two and speech of thanks polite to the last and resolute in doing his duty <\s>
<s> the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rose coloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale <\s>
<s> arthur perhaps saw quite well how yellow blanche looked but did not attribute that peculiarity of her complexion to the effect of the looking glasses or to any error in his sight or her own <\s>
<s> our young man of the world could use his eyes very keenly and could see blanche's face pretty much as nature had made it <\s>
<s> but for poor foker it had a radiance which dazzled and blinded him he could see no more faults in it than in the sun which was now flaring over the house tops <\s>
<s> amongst other wicked london habits which pen had acquired the moralist will remark that he had got to keep very bad hours and often was going to bed at the time when sober country people were thinking of leaving it <\s>
<s> men get used to one hour as to another <\s>
<s> editors of newspapers covent garden market people night cabmen and coffee sellers chimney sweeps and gentlemen and ladies of fashion who frequent balls are often quite lively at three or four o'clock of a morning when ordinary mortals are snoring <\s>
<s> we have shown in the last chapter how pen was in a brisk condition of mind at this period inclined to smoke his cigar at ease and to speak freely <\s>
<s> foker and pen walked away from gaunt house then indulging in both the above amusements or rather pen talked and foker looked as if he wanted to say something <\s>
<s> pen was sarcastic and dandified when he had been in the company of great folks he could not help imitating some of their airs and tones and having a most lively imagination mistook himself for a person of importance very easily <\s>
<s> he rattled away and attacked this person and that sneered at lady john turnbull's bad french which her ladyship will introduce into all conversations in spite of the sneers of everybody at mrs <\s>
<s> slack roper's extraordinary costume and sham jewels at the old dandies and the young ones at whom didn't he sneer and laugh <\s>
<s> you fire at everybody pen you're grown awful that you are foker said <\s>
<s> now you've pulled about blondel's yellow wig and colchicum's black one why don't you have a shy at a brown one hay <\s>
<s> you know whose i mean <\s>
<s> it got into lady clavering's carriage <\s>
<s> under my uncle's hat <\s>
<s> my uncle is a martyr foker my boy <\s>
<s> my uncle has been doing excruciating duties all night <\s>
<s> he likes to go to bed rather early <\s>
<s> he has a dreadful headache if he sits up and touches supper <\s>
<s> each exerted himself and danced a great deal with miss blanche <\s>
<s> as for the worthy major he assumed the charge of lady clavering and took care to introduce her to that department of the mansion where her ladyship specially distinguished herself namely the refreshment room where amongst pictures of titian and giorgione and regal portraits of vandyke and reynolds and enormous salvers of gold and silver and pyramids of large flowers and constellations of wax candles in a manner perfectly regardless of expense in a word a supper was going on all night <\s>
<s> of how many creams jellies salads peaches white soups grapes pates galantines cups of tea champagne and so forth lady clavering partook it does not become us to say <\s>
<s> how much the major suffered as he followed the honest woman about calling to the solemn male attendants and lovely servant maids and administering to lady clavering's various wants with admirable patience nobody knows he never confessed <\s>
<s> he never allowed his agony to appear on his countenance in the least but with a constant kindness brought plate after plate to the begum <\s>
<s> wagg counted up all the dishes of which lady clavering partook as long as he could count but as he partook very freely himself of champagne during the evening his powers of calculation were not to be trusted at the close of the entertainment and he recommended mr <\s>
<s> honeyman lady steyne's medical man to look carefully after the begum and to call and get news of her ladyship the next day <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering made his appearance and skulked for a while about the magnificent rooms but the company and the splendour which he met there were not to the baronet's taste and after tossing off a tumbler of wine or two at the buffet he quitted gaunt house for the neighbourhood of jermyn street where his friends loder punter little moss abramns and captain skewball were assembled at the familiar green table <\s>
<s> in the rattle of the box and of their agreeable conversation sir francis's spirits rose to their accustomed point of feeble hilarity <\s>
<s> pynsent who had asked miss amory to dance came up on one occasion to claim her hand but scowls of recognition having already passed between him and mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis in the dancing room arthur suddenly rose up and claimed miss amory as his partner for the present dance on which mr <\s>
<s> pynsent biting his lips and scowling yet more savagely withdrew with a profound bow saying that he gave up his claim <\s>
<s> there are some men who are always falling in one's way in life <\s>
<s> pynsent and pen had this view of each other and each regarded other accordingly <\s>
<s> what a confounded conceited provincial fool that is <\s>
<s> because he has written a twopenny novel his absurd head is turned and a kicking would take his conceit out of him <\s>
<s> what an impertinent idiot that man is <\s>
<s> remarked the other to his partner <\s>
<s> his soul is in downing street his neckcloth is foolscap his hair is sand his legs are rulers his vitals are tape and sealing wax he was a prig in his cradle and never laughed since he was born except three times at the same joke of his chief <\s>
<s> i have the same liking for that man miss amory i have for that cold boiled veal <\s>
<s> upon which blanche of course remarked that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis was wicked mechant perfectly abominable and wondered what he would say when her back was turned <\s>
<s> say say that you have the most beautiful figure and the slimmest waist in the world blanche miss amory i mean <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> another turn this music would make an alderman dance <\s>
<s> and you have left off tumbling when you waltz now <\s>
<s> blanche asked archly looking up at her partner's face <\s>
<s> one falls and one gets up again in life blanche you know i used to call you so in old times and it is the prettiest name in the world <\s>
<s> besides i have practised since then <\s>
<s> and with a great number of partners i'm afraid blanche said with a little sham sigh and a shrug of the shoulders <\s>
<s> and so in truth mr <\s>
<s> pen had practised a good deal in this life and had undoubtedly arrived at being able to dance better <\s>
<s> if pendennis was impertinent in his talk foker on the other hand so bland and communicative on most occasions was entirely mum and melancholy when he danced with miss amory <\s>
<s> to clasp her slender waist was a rapture to whirl round the room with her was a delirium but to speak to her what could he say that was worthy of her <\s>
<s> what pearl of conversation could he bring that was fit for the acceptance of such a queen of love and wit as blanche <\s>
<s> it was she who made the talk when she was in the company of this love stricken partner <\s>
<s> it was she who asked him bow that dear little pony was and looked at him and thanked him with such a tender kindness and regret and refused the dear little pony with such a delicate sigh when he offered it <\s>
<s> i have nobody to ride with in london she said <\s>
<s> mamma is timid and her figure is not pretty on horseback <\s>
<s> sir francis never goes out with me <\s>
<s> he loves me like like a stepdaughter <\s>
<s> oh how delightful it must be to have a father a father mr <\s>
<s> oh uncommon said mr <\s>
<s> harry who enjoyed that blessing very calmly upon which and forgetting the sentimental air which she had just before assumed blanche's grey eyes gazed at foker with such an arch twinkle that both of them burst out laughing and harry enraptured and at his ease began to entertain her with a variety of innocent prattle good kind simple foker talk flavoured with many expressions by no means to be discovered in dictionaries and relating to the personal history of himself or horses or other things dear and important to him or to persons in the ballroom then passing before them and about whose appearance or character mr <\s>
<s> harry spoke with artless freedom and a considerable dash of humour <\s>
<s> and it was blanche who when the conversation flagged and the youth's modesty came rushing back and overpowering him knew how to reanimate her companion asked him questions about logwood and whether it was a pretty place <\s>
<s> whether he was a hunting man and whether he liked women to hunt <\s>
<s> in which case she was prepared to say that she adored hunting but mr <\s>
<s> foker expressing his opinion against sporting females and pointing out lady bullfinch who happened to pass by as a horse godmother whom he had seen at cover with a cigar in her face blanche too expressed her detestation of the sports of the field and said it would make her shudder to think of a dear sweet little fox being killed on which foker laughed and waltzed with renewed vigour and grace <\s>
<s> and at the end of the waltz the last waltz they had on that night blanche asked him about drummington and whether it was a fine house <\s>
<s> his cousins she had heard were very accomplished lord erith she had met and which of his cousins was his favourite <\s>
<s> was it not lady ann <\s>
<s> yes she was sure it was she sure by his looks and his blushes <\s>
<s> she was tired of dancing it was getting very late she must go to mamma and without another word she sprang away from harry foker's arm and seized upon pen's who was swaggering about the dancing room and again said mamma mamma take me to mamma dear mr <\s>
<s> transfixing harry with a parthian shot as she fled from him <\s>
<s> my lord steyne with garter and ribbon with a bald head and shining eyes and a collar of red whiskers round his face always looked grand upon an occasion of state and made a great effect upon lady clavering when he introduced himself to her at the request of the obsequious major pendennis <\s>
<s> with his own white and royal hand he handed to her ladyship a glass of wine said he had heard of her charming daughter and begged to be presented to her and at this very juncture mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis came up with the young lady on his arm <\s>
<s> the peer made a profound bow and blanche the deepest curtesy that ever was seen <\s>
<s> his lordship gave mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis his hand to shake said he had read his book which was very wicked and clever asked miss blanche if she had read it at which pen blushed and winced <\s>
<s> why blanche was one of the heroines of the novel <\s>
