<s> spavin was enabled to know pendennis's name on the card which the latter took out and laid down perhaps pen in these days was rather proud of having a card and so the young men took leave <\s>
<s> then pen went down the rock and walked about on the sand biting his nails by the shore of the much sounding sea <\s>
<s> it stretched before him bright and immeasurable <\s>
<s> the blue waters came rolling into the bay foaming and roaring hoarsely pen looked them in the face with blank eyes hardly regarding them <\s>
<s> what a tide there was pouring into the lad's own mind at the time and what a little power had he to check it <\s>
<s> pen flung stones into the sea but it still kept coming on <\s>
<s> he was in a rage at not seeing foker <\s>

<s> suppose i go on on the chatteris road just to see if i can meet him pen thought <\s>
<s> rebecca was saddled in another half hour and galloping on the grass by the chatteris road <\s>
<s> about four miles from baymouth the clavering road branches off as everybody knows and the mare naturally was for taking that turn but cutting her over the shoulder pen passed the turning and rode on to the turnpike without seeing any sign of the black tandem and red wheels <\s>
<s> as he was at the turnpike he might as well go on that was quite clear <\s>
<s> so pen rode to the george and the hostler told him that mr <\s>
<s> foker was there sure enough and that he'd been a makin a tremendous row the night afore a drinkin and a singin and wanting to fight tom the postboy which i'm thinking he'd have had the worst of it the man added with a grin <\s>

<s> he added in a very satirical manner to mr <\s>
<s> foker's domestic who here came down the yard bearing his master's clothes most beautifully brushed and arranged <\s>

<s> harry foker lay reposing <\s>
<s> the feather bed and bolsters swelled up all round mr <\s>
<s> foker so that you could hardly see his little sallow face and red silk nightcap <\s>
<s> sang out the voice from the bed <\s>
<s> is your mamma acquainted with your absence <\s>
<s> did you sup with us last night <\s>
<s> no stop who supped with us last night stoopid <\s>
<s> there was the three officers sir and mr <\s>
<s> bingley sir and mr <\s>
<s> costigan sir the man answered who received all mr <\s>
<s> foker's remarks with perfect gravity <\s>
<s> ah yes the cup and merry jest went round <\s>
<s> we chanted and i remember i wanted to fight a postboy <\s>
<s> did i thrash him stoopid <\s>
<s> fight didn't come off sir said stoopid still with perfect gravity <\s>
<s> he was arranging mr <\s>
<s> foker's dressing case a trunk the gift of a fond mother without which the young fellow never travelled <\s>
