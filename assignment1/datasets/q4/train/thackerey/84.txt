<s> the tender heart beat no more it was to have no more pangs no more doubts no more griefs and trials <\s>

<s> would you desire that grief for you should last for a few more weeks <\s>
<s> and does after life seem less solitary provided that our names when we go down into silence are echoing on this side of the grave yet for a little while and human voices are still talking about us <\s>
<s> she was gone the pure soul whom only two or three loved and knew <\s>
<s> the great blank she left was in laura's heart to whom her love had been everything and who had now but to worship her memory <\s>
<s> i am glad that she gave me her blessing before she went away warrington said to pen and as for arthur with a humble acknowledgment and wonder at so much affection he hardly dared to ask of heaven to make him worthy of it though he felt that a saint there was interceding for him <\s>
<s> all the lady's affairs were found in perfect order and her little property ready for transmission to her son in trust for whom she held it <\s>
<s> papers in her desk showed that she had long been aware of the complaint one of the heart under which she laboured and knew that it would suddenly remove her and a prayer was found in her handwriting asking that her end might be as it was in the arms of her son <\s>
<s> laura and arthur talked over her sayings all of which the former most fondly remembered to the young man's shame somewhat who thought how much greater her love had been for helen than his own <\s>
<s> he referred himself entirely to laura to know what helen would have wished should be done what poor persons she would have liked to relieve what legacies or remembrances she would have wished to transmit <\s>
<s> they packed up the vase which helen in her gratitude had destined to dr <\s>
<s> goodenough and duly sent it to the kind doctor a silver coffee pot which she used was sent off to portman a diamond ring with her hair was given with affectionate greeting to warrington <\s>
<s> it must have been a hard day for poor laura when she went over to fairoaks first and to the little room which she had occupied and which was hers no more and to the widow's own blank chamber in which those two had passed so many beloved hours <\s>
<s> there of course were the clothes in the wardrobe the cushion on which she prayed the chair at the toilette the glass that was no more to reflect her dear sad face <\s>
<s> however it may do good for arthur to know it it is that every one here should <\s>
<s> it will divert you from thinking about a subject which out of a fatal misconception has caused a great deal of pain to all of you <\s>
<s> may i please tell you mrs <\s>
<s> pray speak was all helen said and indeed she was not much heeding her mind was full of another idea with which pen's words had supplied her and she was in a terror of hope that what he had hinted might be as she wished <\s>
<s> george filled himself a bumper of wine and emptied it and began to speak <\s>
<s> you all of you know how you see me he said a man without a desire to make an advance in the world careless about reputation and living in a garret and from hand to mouth though i have friends and a name and i daresay capabilities of my own that would serve me if i had a mind <\s>
<s> but mind i have none <\s>
<s> i shall die in that garret most likely and alone <\s>
<s> i nailed myself to that doom in early life <\s>
<s> shall i tell you what it was that interested me about arthur years ago and made me inclined towards him when first i saw him <\s>
<s> the men from our college at oxbridge brought up accounts of that early affair with the chatteris actress about whom pen has talked to me since and who but for the major's generalship might have been your daughter in law ma'am <\s>
<s> i can't see pen in the dark but he blushes i'm sure and i dare say miss bell does and my friend major pendennis i dare say laughs as he ought to do for he won <\s>
<s> what would have been arthur's lot now had he been tied at nineteen to an illiterate woman older than himself with no qualities in common between them to make one a companion for the other no equality no confidence and no love speedily <\s>
<s> what could he have been but most miserable <\s>
<s> and when he spoke just now and threatened a similar union be sure it was but a threat occasioned by anger which you must give me leave to say ma'am was very natural on his part for after a generous and manly conduct let me say who know the circumstances well most generous and manly and self denying which is rare with him he has met from some friends of his with a most unkind suspicion and has had to complain of the unfair treatment of another innocent person towards whom he and you all are under much obligation <\s>
<s> the widow was going to get up here and warrington seeing her attempt to rise said do i tire you ma'am <\s>
<s> oh no go on go on said helen delighted and he continued <\s>
<s> i liked him you see because of that early history of his which had come to my ears in college gossip and because i like a man if you will pardon me for saying so miss laura who shows that he can have a great unreasonable attachment for a woman <\s>
<s> that was why we became friends and are all friends here for always aren't we <\s>
<s> he added in a lower voice leaning over to her and pen has been a great comfort and companion to a lonely and unfortunate man <\s>
<s> i am not complaining of my lot you see for no man's is what he would have it and up in my garret where you left the flowers and with my old books and my pipe for a wife i am pretty contented and only occasionally envy other men whose careers in life are more brilliant or who can solace their ill fortune by what fate and my own fault has deprived me of the affection of a woman or a child <\s>
<s> here there came a sigh from somewhere near warrington in the dark and a hand was held out in his direction which however was instantly withdrawn for the prudery of our females is such that before all expression of feeling or natural kindness and regard a woman is taught to think of herself and the proprieties and to be ready to blush at the very slightest notice and checking as of course it ought this spontaneous motion modesty drew up again kindly friendship shrank back ashamed of itself and warrington resumed his history <\s>
<s> my fate is such as i made it and not lucky for me or for others involved in it <\s>
<s> i too had an adventure before i went to college and there was no one to save me as major pendennis saved pen <\s>
<s> pardon me miss laura if i tell this story before you <\s>
<s> it is as well that you all of you should hear my confession <\s>
<s> before i went to college as a boy of eighteen i was at a private tutor's and there like arthur i became attached or fancied i was attached to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own <\s>
<s> you shrink from me no i don't laura said and here the hand went out resolutely and laid itself in warrington's <\s>
<s> she had divined his story from some previous hints let fall by him and his first words at its commencement <\s>
<s> she was a yeoman's daughter in the neighbourhood warrington said with rather a faltering voice and i fancied what all young men fancy <\s>
<s> her parents knew who my father was and encouraged me with all sorts of coarse artifices and scoundrel flatteries which i see now about their house <\s>
<s> to do her justice i own she never cared for me but was forced into what happened by the threats and compulsion of her family <\s>
<s> would to god that i had not been deceived but in these matters we are deceived because we wish to be so and i thought i loved that poor woman <\s>
<s> what could come of such a marriage <\s>
<s> i found before long that i was married to a boor <\s>
<s> she could not comprehend one subject that interested me <\s>
<s> her dulness palled upon me till i grew to loathe it <\s>
<s> and after some time of a wretched furtive union i must tell you all i found letters somewhere and such letters they were which showed me that her heart such as it was had never been mine but had always belonged to a person of her own degree <\s>
<s> at my father's death i paid what debts i had contracted at college and settled every shilling which remained to me in an annuity upon upon those who bore my name on condition that they should hide themselves away and not assume it <\s>
<s> they have kept that condition as they would break it for more money <\s>
<s> if i had earned fame or reputation that woman would have come to claim it if i had made a name for myself those who no right to it would have borne it and i entered life at twenty god help me hopeless and ruined beyond remission <\s>
<s> i was the boyish victim of vulgar cheats and perhaps it is only of late i have found out how hard ah how hard it is to forgive them <\s>
<s> i told you the moral before pen and now i have told you the fable <\s>
<s> beware how you marry out of your degree <\s>
<s> i was made for a better lot than this i think but god has awarded me this one and so you see it is for me to look on and see others successful and others happy with a heart that shall be as little bitter as possible <\s>
<s> by gad sir cried the major in high good humour i intended you to marry miss laura here <\s>
<s> and by gad master shallow i owe you a thousand pound warrington said <\s>
<s> how d'ye mean a thousand <\s>
<s> it was only a pony sir replied the major simply at which the other laughed <\s>
<s> as for helen she was so delighted that she started up and said god bless you god for ever bless you mr <\s>
<s> warrington and kissed both his hands and ran up to pen and fell into his arms <\s>
<s> yes dearest mother he said as he held her to him and with a noble tenderness and emotion embraced and forgave her <\s>
<s> i am innocent and my dear dear mother has done me a wrong <\s>
<s> oh yes my child i have wronged you thank god i have wronged you <\s>
<s> come away arthur not here i want to ask my child to forgive me and and my god to forgive me and to bless you and love you my son <\s>
<s> he led her tottering into her room and closed the door as the three touched spectators of the reconciliation looked on in pleased silence <\s>
<s> ever after ever after the tender accents of that voice faltering sweetly at his ear the look of the sacred eyes beaming with an affection unutterable the quiver of the fond lips smiling mournfully were remembered by the young man <\s>
<s> and at his best moments and at his hours of trial and grief and at his times of success or well doing the mother's face looked down upon him and blessed him with its gaze of pity and purity as he saw it in that night when she yet lingered with him and when she seemed ere she quite left him an angel transfigured and glorified with love for which love as for the greatest of the bounties and wonders of god's provision for us let us kneel and thank our father <\s>
<s> the moon had risen by this time arthur recollected well afterwards how it lighted up his mother's sweet pale face <\s>
<s> their talk or his rather for she scarcely could speak was more tender and confidential than it had been for years before <\s>
<s> he was the frank and generous boy of her early days and love <\s>
<s> he told her the story the mistake regarding which had caused her so much pain his struggles to fly from temptation and his thankfulness that he had been able to overcome it <\s>
<s> he never would do the girl wrong never or wound his own honour or his mother's pure heart <\s>
<s> the threat that he would return was uttered in a moment of exasperation of which he repented <\s>
<s> he never would see her again <\s>
<s> but his mother said yes he should and it was she who had been proud and culpable and she would like to give fanny bolton something and she begged her dear boy's pardon for opening the letter and she would write to the young girl if if she had time <\s>
<s> was it not natural that she should love her arthur <\s>
<s> and again she kissed him and she blessed him <\s>
<s> as they were talking the clock struck nine and helen reminded him how when he was a little boy she used to go up to his bedroom at that hour and hear him say our father <\s>
<s> and once more oh once more the young man fell down at his mother's sacred knees and sobbed out the prayer which the divine tenderness uttered for us and which has been echoed by twenty ages since by millions of sinful and humbled men <\s>
<s> and as he spoke the last words of the supplication the mother's head fell down on her boy's and her arms closed round him and together they repeated the words for ever and ever and amen <\s>
<s> a little time after it might have been a quarter of an hour laura heard arthur's voice call from within laura <\s>
<s> she rushed into the room instantly and found the young man still on his knees and holding his mother's hand <\s>
<s> helen's head had sunk back and was quite pale in the room <\s>
<s> pen looked round scared with a ghastly terror <\s>
<s> he said she's fainted she's laura screamed and fell by the side of helen <\s>
<s> the shriek brought warrington and major pendennis and the servants to the room <\s>
<s> the sainted woman was dead <\s>
<s> the last emotion of her soul here was joy to be henceforth unchequered and eternal <\s>
