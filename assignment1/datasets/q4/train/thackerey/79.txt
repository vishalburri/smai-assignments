<s> if you agitate yourself so he said to her and if your heart beats so and if you persist in being so anxious about a young gentleman who is getting well as fast as he can we shall have you laid up and miss laura to watch you and then it will be her turn to be ill and i should like to know how the deuce a doctor is to live who is obliged to come and attend you all for nothing <\s>

<s> let me go to him <\s>
<s> old pendennis had his own opinion <\s>
<s> when he briskly took the not guilty side of the case but a moment before very likely the old gentleman had a different view from that which he chose to advocate and judged of arthur by what he himself would have done <\s>
<s> if she goes to arthur and he speaks the truth as the rascal will it spoils all he thought <\s>
<s> and he tried one more effort <\s>
<s> my dear good soul he said taking helen's hand and kissing it as your son has not acquainted you with this affair think if you have any right to examine it <\s>
<s> as you believe him to be a man of honour what right have you to doubt his honour in this instance <\s>
<s> who is his accuser <\s>
<s> an anonymous scoundrel who has brought no specific charge against him <\s>
<s> if there were any such wouldn't the girl's parents have come forward <\s>
<s> he is not called upon to rebut nor you to entertain an anonymous accusation and as for believing him guilty because a girl of that rank happened to be in his rooms acting as nurse to him begad you might as well insist upon his marrying that dem'd old irish gin drinking laundress mrs <\s>
<s> the widow burst out laughing through her tears the victory was gained by the old general <\s>
<s> flanagan by ged he continued tapping her slender hand <\s>
<s> the boy has told you nothing about it and you know nothing about it <\s>
<s> the boy is innocent of course <\s>
<s> and what my good soul is the course for us to pursue <\s>
<s> suppose he is attached to this girl don't look sad again it's merely a supposition and begad a young fellow may have an attachment mayn't he directly he gets well he will be at her again <\s>
<s> he must come home <\s>
<s> we must go off directly to fairoaks the widow cried out <\s>
<s> my good creature he'll bore himself to death at fairoaks <\s>
<s> he'll have nothing to do but to think about his passion there <\s>
<s> there's no place in the world for making a little passion into a big one and where a fellow feeds on his own thoughts like a dem'd lonely country house where there's nothing to do <\s>
<s> we must occupy him amuse him we must take him abroad he's never been abroad except to paris for a lark <\s>
<s> we must travel a little <\s>
<s> he must have a nurse with him to take great care of him for goodenough says he had a dev'lish narrow squeak of it don't look frightened and so you must come and watch and i suppose you'll take miss bell and i should like to ask warrington to come <\s>
<s> arthur's dev'lish fond of warrington <\s>
<s> he can't do without warrington <\s>
<s> warrington's family is one of the oldest in england and he is one of the best young fellows i ever met in my life <\s>
<s> i like him exceedingly <\s>
<s> warrington know anything about this this affair <\s>
<s> he had been away i know for two months before it happened pen wrote me so <\s>
<s> not a word i i've asked him about it <\s>
<s> he never heard of the transaction never i pledge you my word cried out the major in some alarm <\s>
<s> and my dear i think you had much best not talk to him about it much best not of course not the subject is most delicate and painful <\s>
<s> the simple widow took her brother's hand and pressed it <\s>
<s> thank you brother she said <\s>
<s> you have been very very kind to me <\s>
<s> you have given me a great deal of comfort <\s>
<s> i'll go to my room and think of what you have said <\s>
<s> this illness and these these emotions have agitated me a great deal and i'm not very strong you know <\s>
<s> but i'll go and thank god that my boy is innocent <\s>
<s> yes my dearest creature yes said the old fellow kissing her affectionately and quite overcome by her tenderness <\s>
<s> he looked after her as she retreated with a fondness which was rendered more piquant as it were by the mixture of a certain scorn which accompanied it <\s>
<s> he said i'd swear till i was black in the face he was innocent rather than give that good soul pain <\s>
<s> having achieved this victory the fatigued and happy warrior laid himself down on the sofa and put his yellow silk pocket handkerchief over his face and indulged in a snug little nap of which the dreams no doubt were very pleasant as he snored with refreshing regularity <\s>
<s> the young men sate meanwhile dawdling away the sunshiny hours on the terrace very happy and pen at least very talkative <\s>
<s> he was narrating to warrington a plan for a new novel and a new tragedy <\s>
<s> warrington laughed at the idea of his writing a tragedy <\s>
<s> by jove he would show that he could and he began to spout some of the lines of his play <\s>
<s> the little solo on the wind instrument which the major was performing was interrupted by the entrance of miss bell <\s>

<s> for laura the old lady had a great fondness and longed that she should come and stay with her but laura could not leave her mother at this juncture <\s>
