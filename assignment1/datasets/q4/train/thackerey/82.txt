<s> he did not play to lose he said or to win but he did as other folks did and betted his napoleon and took his luck as it came <\s>
<s> he pointed out the russians and spaniards gambling for heaps of gold and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous an english gentleman should play where the fashion is play but should not elate or depress himself at the sport and he told how he had seen his friend the marquis of steyne when lord gaunt lose eighteen thousand at a sitting and break the bank three nights running at paris without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victory <\s>
<s> and that's what i call being an english gentleman pen my dear boy the old gentleman said warming as he prattled about his recollections what i call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in france <\s>

<s> and that's what i call being an english gentleman pen my dear boy the old gentleman said warming as he prattled about his recollections what i call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in france <\s>

<s> you would have said he was the widow's son to watch his constant care and watchfulness of her or that he was an adventurer and wanted to marry her fortune or at any rate that he wanted some very great treasure or benefit from her and very likely he did for ours as the reader has possibly already discovered is a selfish story and almost every person according to his nature more or less generous than george and according to the way of the world as it seems to us is occupied about number one <\s>

<s> that very evening the resolute old gentleman leaning on his nephew's arm made his appearance in the halls of the kursaal and lost or won a napoleon or two at the table of trente et quarante <\s>
<s> he did not play to lose he said or to win but he did as other folks did and betted his napoleon and took his luck as it came <\s>
<s> he pointed out the russians and spaniards gambling for heaps of gold and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous an english gentleman should play where the fashion is play but should not elate or depress himself at the sport and he told how he had seen his friend the marquis of steyne when lord gaunt lose eighteen thousand at a sitting and break the bank three nights running at paris without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victory <\s>
<s> and that's what i call being an english gentleman pen my dear boy the old gentleman said warming as he prattled about his recollections what i call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in france <\s>
<s> and as russian princesses passed him whose reputation had long ceased to be doubtful and damaged english ladies who are constantly seen in company of their faithful attendant for the time being in these gay haunts of dissipation the old major with eager garrulity and mischievous relish told his nephew wonderful particulars regarding the lives of these heroines and diverted the young man with a thousand scandals <\s>
<s> egad he felt himself quite young again he remarked to pen as rouged and grinning her enormous chasseur behind her bearing her shawl the princess obstropski smiled and recognised and accosted him <\s>
<s> he remembered her in 14 when she was an actress of the paris boulevard and the emperor alexander's aide de camp obstropski a man of great talents who knew a good deal about the emperor paul's death and was a devil to play married her <\s>
<s> he most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the princess and to present to her his nephew mr <\s>

<s> what would poor helen have thought could she have heard those tales or known to what kind of people her brother in law was presenting her son <\s>

<s> the old gentleman had been to take one of the baths for which rosenbad is famous and which everybody takes and his after bath toilet was not yet completed when pen arrived <\s>

<s> he remembered her in 14 when she was an actress of the paris boulevard and the emperor alexander's aide de camp obstropski a man of great talents who knew a good deal about the emperor paul's death and was a devil to play married her <\s>
<s> he most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the princess and to present to her his nephew mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis and he pointed out to the latter a half dozen of other personages whose names were as famous and whose histories were as satisfying <\s>
<s> what would poor helen have thought could she have heard those tales or known to what kind of people her brother in law was presenting her son <\s>
<s> only once leaning on arthur's arm she had passed through the room where the green tables were prepared for play and the croaking croupiers were calling out their fatal words of rouge gagne and couleur perd <\s>
<s> she had shrunk terrified out of the pandemonium imploring pen extorting from him a promise on his word of honour that he would never play at those tables and the scene which so frightened the simple widow only amused the worldly old veteran and made him young again <\s>
<s> he could breathe the air cheerfully which stifled her <\s>
<s> her right was not his right his food was her poison <\s>
<s> human creatures are constituted thus differently and with this variety the marvellous world is peopled <\s>
<s> to the credit of mr <\s>
<s> pen let it be said that he kept honestly the promise made to his mother and stoutly told his uncle of his intention to abide by it <\s>
<s> when the major arrived his presence somehow cast a damp upon at least three of the persons of our little party upon laura who had anything but respect for him upon warrington whose manner towards him showed an involuntary haughtiness and contempt and upon the timid and alarmed widow who dreaded lest he should interfere with her darling though almost desperate projects for her boy <\s>
<s> and indeed the major unknown to himself was the bearer of tidings which were to bring about a catastrophe in the affairs of all our friends <\s>
<s> pen with his two ladies had apartments in the town of rosenbad honest warrington had lodgings hard by the major on arrival at rosenbad had as befitted his dignity taken his quarters at one of the great hotels at the roman emperor or the four seasons where two or three hundred gamblers pleasure seekers or invalids sate down and over ate themselves daily at the enormous table d'hote <\s>
<s> to this hotel pen went on the morning after the major's arrival dutifully to pay his respects to his uncle and found the latter's sitting room duly prepared and arranged by mr <\s>
<s> morgan with the major's hats brushed and his coats laid out his despatch boxes and umbrella cases his guidebooks passports maps and other elaborate necessaries of the english traveller all as trim and ready as they could be in their master's own room in jermyn street <\s>
<s> everything was ready from the medicine bottle fresh filled from the pharmacien's down to the old fellow's prayer book without which he never travelled for he made a point of appearing at the english church at every place which he honoured with a stay everybody did it he said every english gentleman did it and this pious man would as soon have thought of not calling upon the english ambassador in a continental town as of not showing himself at the national place of worship <\s>
<s> the old gentleman had been to take one of the baths for which rosenbad is famous and which everybody takes and his after bath toilet was not yet completed when pen arrived <\s>
<s> the elder called out to arthur in a cheery voice from the inner apartment in which he and morgan were engaged and the valet presently came in bearing a little packet to pen's address mr <\s>
<s> arthur's letters and papers morgan said which he had brought from mr <\s>
<s> arthur's chambers in london and which consisted chiefly of numbers of the pall mall gazette which our friend mr <\s>
<s> finucane thought his collaborateur would like to see <\s>
<s> the papers were tied together the letters in an envelope addressed to pen in the last named gentleman's handwriting <\s>
<s> amongst the letters there was a little note addressed as a former letter we have heard of had been to arther pendennis esquire which arthur opened with a start and a blush and read with a very keen pang of interest and sorrow and regard <\s>
<s> she had come to arthur's house fanny bolton said and found that he was gone gone away to germany without ever leaving a word for her or answer to her last letter in which she prayed but for one word of kindness or the books which he had promised her in happier times before he was ill and which she should like to keep in remembrance of him <\s>
<s> she said she would not reproach those who had found her at his bedside when he was in the fever and knew nobody and who had turned the poor girl away without a word <\s>
<s> she thought she should have died she said of that but doctor goodenough had kindly tended her and kept her life when perhaps the keeping of it was of no good and she forgave everybody and as for arthur she would pray for him for ever <\s>
<s> and when he was so ill and they cut off his hair she had made so free as to keep one little lock for herself and that she owned <\s>
<s> and might she still keep it or would his mamma order that that should be gave up too <\s>
<s> she was willing to obey him in all things and couldn't but remember that once he was so kind oh <\s>
<s> so good and kind <\s>
<s> to his poor fanny <\s>
<s> when major pendennis fresh and smirking from his toilet came out of his bedroom to his sitting room he found arthur with this note before him and an expression of savage anger on his face which surprised the elder gentleman <\s>
<s> what news from london my boy <\s>
<s> he rather faintly asked are the duns at you that you look so glum <\s>
<s> do you know anything about this letter sir <\s>
<s> what letter my good sir <\s>
<s> said the other dryly at once perceiving what had happened <\s>
<s> you know what i mean about about miss about fanny bolton the poor dear little girl arthur broke out <\s>
<s> when she was in my room <\s>
<s> was she there when i was delirious i fancied she was was she <\s>
<s> who sent her out of my chambers <\s>
<s> who intercepted her letters to me <\s>
<s> who dared to do it <\s>
<s> did you do it uncle <\s>
<s> it's not my practice to tamper with gentlemen's letters or to answer damned impertinent questions major pendennis cried out in a great tremor of emotion and indignation <\s>
<s> there was a girl in your rooms when i came up at great personal inconvenience daymy and to meet with a return of this kind for my affection to you is not pleasant by gad sir not at all pleasant <\s>
<s> that's not the question sir arthur said hotly and i beg your pardon uncle <\s>
<s> you were you always have been most kind to me but i say again did you say anything harsh to this poor girl <\s>
<s> did you send her away from me <\s>
<s> i never spoke a word to the girl the uncle said and i never sent her away from you and know no more about her and wish to know no more about her than about the man in the moon <\s>
<s> then it's my mother that did it arthur broke out <\s>
<s> did my mother send that poor child away <\s>
<s> i repeat i know nothing about it sir the elder said testily <\s>
<s> let's change the subject if you please <\s>
<s> i'll never forgive the person who did it said arthur bouncing up and seizing his hat <\s>
<s> the major cried out stop arthur for god's sake stop but before he had uttered his sentence arthur had rushed out of the room and at the next minute the major saw him striding rapidly down the street that led towards his home <\s>
<s> said the old fellow to morgan and he wagged his head and sighed as he looked out of the window <\s>
<s> there'll be a row <\s>
<s> i knew there would and begad all the fat's in the fire <\s>
<s> when pen reached home he only found warrington in the ladies drawing room waiting their arrival in order to conduct them to the room where the little english colony at rosenbad held their sunday church <\s>
<s> helen and laura had not appeared as yet the former was ailing and her daughter was with her <\s>
<s> pen's wrath was so great that he could not defer expressing it <\s>
<s> he flung fanny's letter across the table to his friend <\s>
<s> look there warrington he said she tended me in my illness she rescued me out of the jaws of death and this is the way they have treated the dear little creature <\s>
<s> they have kept her letters from me they have treated me like a child and her like a dog poor thing <\s>
<s> my mother has done this <\s>
<s> if she has you must remember it is your mother warrington interposed <\s>
<s> it only makes the crime the greater because it is she who has done it pen answered <\s>
<s> she ought to have been the poor girl's defender not her enemy she ought to go down on her knees and ask pardon of her <\s>
<s> i am shocked at the cruelty which has been shown her <\s>
<s> she gave me her all and this is her return <\s>
