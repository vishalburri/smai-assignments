<s> there must be no more tattling and scandal about that house <\s>
<s> it est more en espang madame she said with a sigh <\s>
<s> she was proud of her intimacy with the french language and spoke it with more volubility than correctness <\s>
<s> pendennis did not care to penetrate the secrets of this wounded heart except to her few intimates she was a reserved and it may be a very proud woman she looked upon her son's tutor merely as an attendant on that young prince to be treated with respect as a clergyman certainly but with proper dignity as a dependant on the house of pendennis <\s>
<s> nor were madame's constant allusions to the curate particularly agreeable to her <\s>
<s> it required a very ingenious sentimental turn indeed to find out that the widow had a secret regard for mr <\s>
<s> smirke to which pernicious error however madame fribsby persisted in holding <\s>
<s> her lodger was very much more willing to talk on this subject with his soft hearted landlady <\s>
<s> every time after that she praised the curate to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis she came away from the latter with the notion that the widow herself had been praising him <\s>
<s> etre soul au monde est bien ouneeyoung she would say glancing up at a print of a french carbineer in a green coat and brass cuirass which decorated her apartment depend upon it when master pendennis goes to college his ma will find herself very lonely <\s>

<s> monsieur le cury song cure est touchy j'ang suis sure je conny cela biang ally monsieur smirke <\s>
<s> he softly blushed he sighed he hoped he feared he doubted he sometimes yielded to the delightful idea his pleasure was to sit in madame fribsby's apartment and talk upon the subject where as the greater part of the conversation was carried on in french by the milliner and her old mother was deaf that retired old individual who had once been a housekeeper wife and widow of a butler in the clavering family could understand scarce one syllable of their talk <\s>
<s> thus it was that when major pendennis announced to his nephew's tutor that the young fellow would go to college in october and that mr <\s>
<s> smirke's valuable services would no longer be needful to his pupil for which services the major who spoke as grandly as a lord professed himself exceedingly grateful and besought mr <\s>
<s> smirke to command his interests in any way thus it was that the curate felt that the critical moment was come for him and was racked and tortured by those severe pangs which the occasion warranted <\s>
<s> madame fribsby had of course taken the strongest interest in the progress of mr <\s>
<s> pen's love affair with miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> she had been over to chatteris and having seen that actress perform had pronounced that she was old and overrated and had talked over master pen's passion in her shop many and many a time to the half dozen old maids and old women in male clothes who are to be found in little country towns and who formed the genteel population of clavering <\s>
<s> captain glanders h p had pronounced that pen was going to be a devil of a fellow and had begun early mrs <\s>
<s> glanders had told him to check his horrid observations and to respect his own wife if he pleased <\s>
<s> she said it would be a lesson to helen for her pride and absurd infatuation about that boy <\s>
<s> pybus said many people were proud of very small things and for her part she didn't know why an apothecary's wife should give herself such airs <\s>
<s> wapshot called her daughters away from that side of the street one day when pen on rebecca was stopping at the saddler's to get a new lash to his whip one and all of these people had made visits of curiosity to fairoaks and had tried to condole with the widow or bring the subject of the fotheringay affair on the tapis and had been severally checked by the haughty reserve of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis supported by the frigid politeness of the major her brother <\s>
<s> these rebuffs however did not put an end to the gossip and slander went on increasing about the unlucky fairoaks family <\s>
<s> glanders h p a retired cavalry officer whose half pay and large family compelled him to fuddle himself with brandy and water instead of claret after he quitted the dragoons had the occasional entree at fairoaks and kept his friend the major there informed of all the stories which were current at clavering <\s>
<s> pybus had taken an inside place by the coach to chatteris and gone to the george on purpose to get the particulars <\s>
<s> speers's man had treated mr <\s>
<s> foker's servant to drink at baymouth for a similar purpose <\s>
<s> it was said that pen had hanged himself for despair in the orchard and that his uncle had cut him down that on the contrary it was miss costigan who was jilted and not young arthur and that the affair had only been hushed up by the payment of a large sum of money the exact amount of which there were several people in clavering could testify the sum of course varying according to the calculation of the individual narrator of the story <\s>
<s> pen shook his mane and raged like a furious lion when these scandals affecting miss costigan's honour and his own came to his ears <\s>
<s> why was not pybus a man she had whiskers enough that he might call her out and shoot her <\s>
<s> seeing simcoe pass by pen glared at him so from his saddle on rebecca and clutched his whip in a manner so menacing that that clergyman went home and wrote a sermon or thought over a sermon for he delivered oral testimony at great length in which he spoke of jezebel theatrical entertainments a double cut this for doctor portman the rector of the old church was known to frequent such and of youth going to perdition in a manner which made it clear to every capacity that pen was the individual meant and on the road alluded to <\s>
<s> what stories more were there not against young pendennis whilst he sate sulking achilles like in his tent for the loss of his ravished briseis <\s>
<s> after the affair with hobnell pen was pronounced to be a murderer as well as a profligate and his name became a name of terror and a byword in clavering <\s>
<s> but this was not all he was not the only one of the family about whom the village began to chatter and his unlucky mother was the next to become a victim to their gossip <\s>
<s> it is all settled said mrs <\s>
<s> speers the boy is to go to college and then the widow is to console herself <\s>
<s> he's been there every day in the most open manner my dear continued mrs <\s>
<s> enough to make poor mr <\s>
<s> pendennis turn in his grave said mrs <\s>

<s> portman some one said as the good rector's wife entered madame fribsby's shop to inspect her monthly book of fashions just arrived from london <\s>
<s> and the fact is that madame fribsby had been able to hold out no longer and one day after she and her lodger had been talking of pen's approaching departure and the curate had gone off to give one of his last lessons to that gentleman madame fribsby had communicated to mrs <\s>

<s> speers her strong suspicion her certainty almost that there was an attachment between a certain clerical gentleman and a certain lady whose naughty son was growing quite unmanageable and that a certain marriage would take place pretty soon <\s>

<s> she could hardly stay five minutes at madame fribsby's so eager was she to run to the rectory and give doctor portman the news <\s>

<s> you always choose the most charitable reason betsy cried the rector <\s>

<s> you only think men should marry again doctor portman answered his lady bridling up <\s>
<s> you stupid old woman said the doctor when i am gone you shall marry whomsoever you like <\s>
<s> i will leave orders in my will my dear to that effect and i'll bequeath a ring to my successor and my ghost shall come and dance at your wedding <\s>
<s> it is cruel for a clergyman to talk so the lady answered with a ready whimper but these little breezes used to pass very rapidly over the surface of the doctor's domestic bliss and were followed by a great calm and sunshine <\s>
<s> the doctor adopted a plan for soothing mrs <\s>
<s> portman's ruffled countenance which has a great effect when it is tried between a worthy couple who are sincerely fond of one another and which i think becomes john anderson at three score just as much as it used to do when he was a black haired young jo of five and twenty <\s>
<s> hadn't you better speak to mr <\s>
<s> when pen goes to college cadit quaestio replied the rector smirke's visits at fairoaks will cease of themselves and there will be no need to bother the widow <\s>

<s> it is not for want of warning on your part i am sure that i have formed my opinion of most women with whom we are acquainted <\s>
