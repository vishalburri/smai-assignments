<s> foker made his appearance to the surprise of the world and of his mother especially whom he ordered to apply for cards to these parties for which until now he had shown a supreme contempt <\s>
<s> he told the pleased and unsuspicious lady that he went to parties because it was right for him to see the world he told her that he went to the french play because he wanted to perfect himself in the language and there was no such good lesson as a comedy or vaudeville and when one night the astonished lady agnes saw him stand up and dance and complimented him upon his elegance and activity the mendacious little rogue asserted that he had learned to dance in paris whereas anatole knew that his young master used to go off privily to an academy in brewer street and study there for some hours in the morning <\s>

<s> we will go to church sir across the park and then begad we will go to the claverings house and ask them for lunch in a friendly way <\s>
<s> lady clavering likes to be asked for lunch and is uncommonly kind and monstrous hospitable <\s>
<s> i met them at dinner last week at lady agnes foker's sir pen said and the begum was very kind indeed <\s>

<s> foker sticks to me sir arthur answered <\s>
<s> he has been at our chambers several times lately <\s>
<s> he has asked me to dinner <\s>
<s> we are almost as great friends as we used to be in our youth and his talk is about blanche amory from morning till night <\s>
<s> i'm sure he's sweet upon her <\s>
<s> i'm sure he is engaged to his cousin and that they will keep the young man to his bargain said the major <\s>
<s> the marriages in these families are affairs of state <\s>
<s> lady agnes was made to marry old foker by the late lord although she was notoriously partial to her cousin who was killed at albuera afterwards and who saved her life out of the lake at drummington <\s>
<s> i remember lady agnes sir an exceedingly fine woman <\s>
<s> but what did she do of course she married her father's man <\s>
<s> foker sate for drummington till the reform bill and paid dev'lish well for his seat too <\s>

<s> blanche is a dangerous girl sir pen said <\s>
<s> i was smitten with her myself once and very far gone too he added but that is years ago <\s>
<s> how far did it go <\s>
<s> did she return it <\s>
<s> asked the major looking hard at pen <\s>
<s> pen with a laugh said that at one time he did think he was pretty well in miss amory's good graces <\s>

<s> what's ten thousand pound and a girl bred up like her <\s>
<s> you use my own words and it is all very well <\s>
<s> but i tell you in confidence pen in strict honour mind that it's my belief she has a devilish deal more than ten thousand pound and from what i saw of her the other day and and have heard of her i should say she was a devilish accomplished clever girl and would make a good wife with a sensible husband <\s>
<s> how do you know about her money <\s>
<s> you seem to have information about everybody and to know about all the town <\s>

<s> oriel is a beautiful preacher <\s>
<s> indeed the bells were tolling the people were trooping into the handsome church the carriages of the inhabitants of the lordly quarter poured forth their pretty loads of devotees in whose company pen and his uncle ending their edifying conversation entered the fane <\s>
<s> i do not know whether other people carry their worldly affairs to the church door <\s>
<s> arthur who from habitual reverence and feeling was always more than respectful in a place of worship thought of the incongruity of their talk perhaps whilst the old gentleman at his side was utterly unconscious of any such contrast <\s>
<s> his hat was brushed his wig was trim his neckcloth was perfectly tied <\s>
<s> he looked at every soul in the congregation it is true the bald heads and the bonnets the flowers and the feathers but so demurely that he hardly lifted up his eyes from his book from his book which he could not read without glasses <\s>
<s> as for pen's gravity it was sorely put to the test when upon looking by chance towards the seats where the servants were collected he spied out by the side of a demure gentleman in plush henry foker esquire who had discovered this place of devotion <\s>
<s> following the direction of harry's eye which strayed a good deal from his book pen found that it alighted upon a yellow bonnet and a pink one and that these bonnets were on the heads of lady clavering and blanche amory <\s>
<s> if pen's uncle is not the only man who has talked about his worldly affairs up to the church door is poor harry foker the only one who has brought his worldly love into the aisle <\s>
<s> when the congregation issued forth at the conclusion of the service foker was out amongst the first but pen came up with him presently as he was hankering about the entrance which he was unwilling to leave until my lady's barouche with the bewigged coachman had borne away its mistress and her daughter from their devotions <\s>
