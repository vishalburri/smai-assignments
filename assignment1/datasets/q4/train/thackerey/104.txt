<s> i must have emotions it m'en donne <\s>
<s> il ecrit tres bien voyez vous comme un pirate comme un bohemien comme un homme <\s>
<s> but for this i would have said to my mother ma mere <\s>
<s> quittons ce lache mari cette lache societe retournons a mon pere <\s>
<s> the pirate would have wearied you like the rest said pen <\s>
<s> il me faut des emotions said blanche <\s>
<s> pen had never seen her or known so much about her in all the years of their intimacy as he saw and knew now though he saw more than existed in reality <\s>
<s> for this young lady was not able to carry out any emotion to the full but had a sham enthusiasm a sham hatred a sham love a sham taste a sham grief each of which flared and shone very vehemently for an instant but subsided and gave place to the next sham emotion <\s>
<s> a chapter of match making upon the platform at tunbridge pen fumed and fretted until the arrival of the evening train to london a full half hour six hours it seemed to him but even this immense interval was passed the train arrived the train sped on the london lights came in view a gentleman who forgot his carpet bag in the train rushed at a cab and said to the man drive as hard as you can go to jermyn street <\s>
<s> the cabman although a hansom cabman said thank you for the gratuity which was put into his hand and pen ran up the stairs of the hotel to lady rockminster's apartments <\s>
<s> laura was alone in the drawing room reading with a pale face by the lamp <\s>
<s> the pale face looked up when pen opened the door <\s>
<s> may we follow him <\s>
<s> the great moments of life are but moments like the others <\s>
<s> your doom is spoken in a word or two <\s>
<s> a single look from the eyes a mere pressure of the hand may decide it or of the lips though they cannot speak <\s>
<s> when lady rockminster who has had her after dinner nap gets up and goes into her sitting room we may enter with her ladyship <\s>
<s> upon my word young people <\s>
<s> are the first words she says and her attendant makes wondering eyes over her shoulder <\s>
<s> and well may she say so and well may the attendant cast wondering eyes for the young people are in an attitude and pen in such a position as every young lady who reads this has heard tell of or has seen or hopes or at any rate deserves to see <\s>
<s> in a word directly he entered the room pen went up to laura of the pale face who had not time even to say what back so soon <\s>
<s> and seizing her outstretched and trembling hand just as she was rising from her chair fell down on his knees before her and said quickly i have seen her <\s>
