<s> in pen's second year major pendennis paid a brief visit to his nephew and was introduced to several of pen's university friends the gentle and polite lord plinlimmon the gallant and open hearted magnus charters the sly and witty harland the intrepid ringwood who was called rupert in the union debating club from his opinions and the bravery of his blunders broadbent styled barebones broadbent from the republican nature of his opinions he was of a dissenting family from bristol and a perfect boanerges of debate ); mr <\s>
<s> bloundell bloundell finally who had at once taken his place among the select of the university <\s>
<s> major pendennis though he did not understand harland's greek quotations or quite appreciate broadbent's thick shoes and dingy hands was nevertheless delighted with the company assembled round his nephew and highly approved of all the young men with the exception of that one who gave himself the greatest airs in the society and affected most to have the manners of a man of the world <\s>
<s> as he and pen sate at breakfast on the morning after the party in the rooms of the latter the major gave his opinions regarding the young men with whom he was in the greatest good humour <\s>
<s> he had regaled them with some of his stories which though not quite so fresh in london where people have a diseased appetite for novelty in the way of anecdotes were entirely new at oxbridge and the lads heard them with that honest sympathy that eager pleasure that boisterous laughter or that profound respect so rare in the metropolis and which must be so delightful to the professed raconteur <\s>
<s> only once or twice during the telling of the anecdote mr <\s>
<s> bloundell's face wore a look of scorn or betrayed by its expression that he was acquainted with the tales narrated <\s>
<s> once he had the audacity to question the accuracy of one of the particulars of a tale as given by major pendennis and gave his own version of the anecdote about which he knew he was right for he heard it openly talked of at the club by so and so and t'other who were present at the business <\s>
<s> the youngsters present looked up with wonder at their associate who dared to interrupt the major few of them could appreciate that melancholy grace and politeness with which major pendennis at once acceded to mr <\s>
<s> bloundell's version of the story and thanked him for correcting his own error <\s>
<s> they stared on the next occasion of meeting when bloundell spoke in contemptuous terms of old pen said everybody knew old pen regular old trencherman at gaunt house notorious old bore regular old fogy <\s>
<s> major pendennis on his side liked mr <\s>
<s> bloundell not a whit <\s>
<s> these sympathies are pretty sure to be mutual amongst men and women and if for my part some kind friend tells me that such and such a man has been abusing me i am almost sure on my own side that i have a misliking to such and such a man <\s>
<s> we like or dislike each other as folks like or dislike the odour of certain flowers or the taste of certain dishes or wines or certain books <\s>
<s> we can't tell why but as a general rule all the reasons in the world will not make us love dr <\s>
<s> fell and as sure as we dislike him we may be sure that he dislikes us <\s>
<s> so the major said pen my boy your dinner went off a merveille you did the honours very nicely you carved well i am glad you learned to carve it is done on the sideboard now in most good houses but is still an important point and may aid you in middle life young lord plinlimmon is a very amiable young man quite the image of his dear mother whom i knew as lady aquila brownbill ); and lord magnus's republicanism will wear off it sits prettily enough on a young patrician in early life though nothing is so loathsome among persons of our rank mr <\s>
<s> broadbent seems to have much eloquence and considerable reading your friend foker is always delightful but your acquaintance mr <\s>
<s> bloundell struck me as in all respects a most ineligible young man <\s>
<s> bless my soul sir bloundell bloundell <\s>
<s> cried pen laughing why sir he's the most popular man of the university <\s>
<s> we elected him of the barmecides the first week he came up had a special meeting on purpose he's of an excellent family suffolk bloundells descended from richard's blondel bear a harp in chief and motto o mong roy <\s>
<s> a man may have a very good coat of arms and be a tiger my boy the major said chipping his egg that man is a tiger mark my word a low man <\s>
<s> i will lay a wager that he left his regiment which was a good one for a more respectable man than my friend lord martingale never sate in a saddle in bad odour <\s>
<s> there is the unmistakable look of slang and bad habits about this mr <\s>
<s> he frequents low gambling houses and billiard hells sir he haunts third rate clubs i know he does <\s>
<s> i know by his style <\s>
<s> i never was mistaken in my man yet <\s>
<s> did you remark the quantity of rings and jewellery he wore <\s>
<s> that person has scamp written on his countenance if any man ever had <\s>
<s> mark my words and avoid him <\s>
<s> let us turn the conversation <\s>
<s> the dinner was a leetle too fine but i don't object to your making a few extra frais when you receive friends <\s>
<s> of course you don't do it often and only those whom it is your interest to feter <\s>
<s> the cutlets were excellent and the souffle uncommonly light and good <\s>
<s> the third bottle of champagne was not necessary but you have a good income and as long as you keep within it i shall not quarrel with you my dear boy <\s>
<s> the worthy uncle little knew how often those dinners took place while the reckless young amphitryon delighted to show his hospitality and skill in gourmandise <\s>
<s> there is no art than that so long to learn so difficult to acquire so impossible and beyond the means of many unhappy people about which boys are more anxious to have an air of knowingness <\s>
<s> a taste and knowledge of wines and cookery appears to them to be the sign of an accomplished roue and manly gentleman <\s>
<s> i like to see them wink at a glass of claret as if they had an intimate acquaintance with it and discuss a salmi poor boys it is only when they grow old that they know they know nothing of the science when perhaps their conscience whispers them that the science is in itself little worth and that a leg of mutton and content is as good as the dinners of pontiffs <\s>
<s> but little pen in his character of admirable crichton thought it necessary to be a great judge and practitioner of dinners we have just said how the college cook respected him and shall soon have to deplore that that worthy man so blindly trusted our pen <\s>
<s> in the third year of the lad's residence at oxbridge his staircase was by no means encumbered with dish covers and desserts and waiters carrying in dishes and skips opening iced champagne crowds of different sorts of attendants with faces sulky or piteous hung about the outer oak and assailed the unfortunate lad as he issued out of his den <\s>
<s> nor did his guardian's advice take any effect or induce mr <\s>
<s> pen to avoid the society of the disreputable mr <\s>
<s> what young men like in their companions is what had got pen a great part of his own repute and popularity a real or supposed knowledge of life <\s>
<s> a man who has seen the world or can speak of it with a knowing air a roue or lovelace who has his adventures to relate is sure of an admiring audience among boys <\s>
<s> it is hard to confess but so it is <\s>
<s> we respect that sort of prowess <\s>
<s> from our school days we have been taught to admire it <\s>
<s> are there five in the hundred out of the hundreds and hundreds of english school boys brought up at our great schools and colleges that must not own at one time of their lives to having read and liked don juan <\s>
<s> awful propagation of evil the idea of it should make the man tremble who holds the pen lest untruth or impurity or unjust anger or unjust praise escape it <\s>
<s> one such diseased creature as this is enough to infect a whole colony and the tutors of boniface began to find the moral tone of their college lowered and their young men growing unruly and almost ungentleman like soon after mr <\s>
<s> bloundell's arrival at oxbridge <\s>
<s> the young magnates of the neighbouring great college of st <\s>
<s> george's who regarded pen and in whose society he lived were not taken in by bloundell's flashy graces and rakish airs of fashion <\s>
<s> broadbent called him captain macheath and said he would live to be hanged <\s>
<s> foker during his brief stay at the university with macheath with characteristic caution declined to say anything in the captain's disfavour but hinted to pen that he had better have him for a partner at whist than play against him and better back him at ecarte than bet on the other side <\s>
<s> you see he plays better than you do pen was the astute young gentleman's remark he plays uncommon well the captain does and pen i wouldn't take the odds too freely from him if i was you <\s>
<s> i don't think he's too flush of money the captain ain't <\s>
<s> but beyond these dark suggestions and generalities the cautious foker could not be got to speak <\s>
<s> not that his advice would have had more weight with a headstrong young man than advice commonly has with a lad who is determined on pursuing his own way <\s>
<s> pen's appetite for pleasure was insatiable and he rushed at it wherever it presented itself with an eagerness which bespoke his fiery constitution and youthful health <\s>
<s> he called taking pleasure seeing life and quoted well known maxims from terence from horace from shakspeare to show that one should do all that might become a man <\s>
<s> he bade fair to be utterly used up and a roue in a few years if he were to continue at the pace at which he was going <\s>
<s> one night after a supper party in college at which pen and macheath had been present and at which a little quiet vingt et un had been played an amusement much pleasanter to men in their second and third year than the boisterous custom of singing songs which bring the proctors about the rooms and which have grown quite stale by this time every man having expended his budget as the men had taken their caps and were going away after no great losses or winnings on any side mr <\s>
<s> bloundell playfully took up a green wine glass from the supper table which had been destined to contain iced cup but into which he inserted something still more pernicious namely a pair of dice which the gentleman took out of his waistcoat pocket and put into the glass <\s>
<s> then giving the glass a graceful wave which showed that his hand was quite experienced in the throwing of dice he called sevens the main and whisking the ivory cubes gently on the table swept them up lightly again from the cloth and repeated this process two or three times <\s>
<s> the other men looked on pen of course among the number who had never used the dice as yet except to play a humdrum game of backgammon at home <\s>
<s> bloundell who had a good voice began to troll out the chorus from robert the devil an opera then in great vogue in which chorus many of the men joined especially pen who was in very high spirits having won a good number of shillings and half crowns at the vingt et un and presently instead of going home most of the party were seated round the table playing at dice the green glass going round from hand to hand until pen finally shivered it after throwing six mains <\s>
<s> from that night pen plunged into the delights of the game of hazard as eagerly as it was his custom to pursue any new pleasure <\s>
<s> dice can be played of mornings as well as after dinner or supper <\s>
<s> bloundell would come into pen's rooms after breakfast and it was astonishing how quick the time passed as the bones were rattling <\s>
<s> they had little quiet parties with closed doors and bloundell devised a box lined with felt so that the dice should make no noise and their tell tale rattle not bring the sharp eared tutors up to the rooms <\s>
<s> bloundell ringwood and pen were once very nearly caught by mr <\s>
<s> buck who passing in the quadrangle thought he heard the words two to one on the caster through pen's open window but when the tutor got into arthur's rooms he found the lads with three homers before them and pen said he was trying to coach the two other men and asked mr <\s>
<s> buck with great gravity what was the present condition of the river scamander and whether it was navigable or no <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis did not win much money in these transactions with mr <\s>
<s> bloundell or indeed gain good of any kind except a knowledge of the odds at hazard which he might have learned out of books <\s>
<s> captain macheath had other accomplishments which he exercised for pen's benefit <\s>
<s> the captain's stories had a great and unfortunate charm for arthur who was never tired of hearing bloundell's histories of garrison conquests and of his feats in country quarters he had been at paris and had plenty of legends about the palais royal and the salon and frascati's <\s>
<s> he had gone to the salon one night after a dinner at the cafe de paris when we were all devilishly cut by jove and on waking in the morning in my own rooms i found myself with twelve thousand francs under my pillow and a hundred and forty nine napoleons in one of my boots <\s>
<s> wasn't that a coup hay <\s>
<s> pen's eyes glistened with excitement as he heard this story <\s>
<s> he respected the man who could win such a sum of money <\s>
<s> he sighed and said it would set him all right <\s>
<s> macheath laughed and told him to drink another drop of maraschino <\s>
<s> i could tell you stories much more wonderful than that he added and so indeed the captain could have done without any further trouble than that of invention with which portion of the poetic faculty nature had copiously endowed him <\s>
<s> he laughed to scorn pen's love for miss fotheringay when he came to hear of that amour from arthur as he pretty soon did for we have said pen was not averse to telling the story now to his confidential friends and he and they were rather proud of the transaction <\s>
<s> but macheath took away all pen's conceit on this head not by demonstrating the folly of the lad's passion for an uneducated woman much his senior in years but by exposing his absurd desire of gratifying his passion in a legitimate way <\s>
<s> marry her said he you might as well marry and he named one of the most notorious actresses on the stage <\s>
<s> she hadn't a shred of a character <\s>
<s> he knew twenty men who were openly admirers of her and named them and the sums each had spent upon her <\s>
<s> i know no kind of calumny more frightful or frequent than this which takes away the character of women no men more reckless and mischievous than those who lightly use it and no kind of cowards more despicable than the people who invent these slanders <\s>
<s> is it or not a misfortune that a man himself of a candid disposition and disposed like our friend pen to blurt out the truth on all occasions begins life by believing all that is said to him <\s>
<s> would it be better for a lad to be less trustful and so less honest <\s>
