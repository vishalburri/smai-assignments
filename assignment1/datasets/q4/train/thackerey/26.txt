<s> he had got an exeat somehow and was bent on a day's lark in london he never stopped rattling and talking from the commencement of the journey until its close which was a great deal too soon for me for i never was tired of listening to the honest young fellow's jokes and cheery laughter ); and when we arrived at the terminus nothing would satisfy him but a hansom cab so that he might get into town the quicker and plunge into the pleasures awaiting him there <\s>
<s> away the young lad went whirling with joy lighting up his honest face and as for the reader's humble servant having but a small carpet bag i got up on the outside of the omnibus and sate there very contentedly between a jew pedlar smoking bad cigars and a gentleman's servant taking care of a poodle dog until we got our fated complement of passengers and boxes when the coachman drove leisurely away <\s>
<s> we weren't in a hurry to get to town <\s>
<s> neither one of us was particularly eager about rushing into that near smoking babylon or thought of dining at the club that night or dancing at the casino <\s>
<s> yet a few years more and my young friend of the railroad will be not a whit more eager <\s>
<s> there were no railroads made when arthur pendennis went to the famous university of oxbridge but he drove thither in a well appointed coach filled inside and out with dons gownsmen young freshmen about to enter and their guardians who were conducting them to the university <\s>
<s> a fat old gentleman in grey stockings from the city who sate by major pendennis inside the coach having his pale faced son opposite was frightened beyond measure when he heard that the coach had been driven for a couple of stages by young mr <\s>
<s> foker of saint boniface college who was the friend of all men including coachmen and could drive as well as tom hicks himself <\s>
<s> pen sate on the roof examining coach passengers and country with great delight and curiosity <\s>
<s> his heart jumped with pleasure as the famous university came in view and the magnificent prospect of venerable towers and pinnacles tall elms and shining river spread before him <\s>
<s> pen had passed a few days with his uncle at the major's lodgings in bury street before they set out for oxbridge <\s>
<s> major pendennis thought that the lad's wardrobe wanted renewal and arthur was by no means averse to any plan which was to bring him new coats and waistcoats <\s>
<s> there was no end to the sacrifices which the self denying uncle made in the youth's behalf <\s>
<s> london was awfully lonely <\s>
<s> the pall mall pavement was deserted the very red jackets had gone out of town <\s>
<s> there was scarce a face to be seen in the bow windows of the clubs <\s>
<s> the major conducted his nephew into one or two of those desert mansions and wrote down the lad's name on the candidate list of one of them and arthur's pleasure at this compliment on his guardian's part was excessive <\s>
<s> he read in the parchment volume his name and titles as arthur pendennis esquire of fairoaks lodge shire and saint boniface college oxbridge proposed by major pendennis and seconded by viscount colchicum with a thrill of intense gratification <\s>
<s> you will come in for ballot in about three years by which time you will have taken your degree the guardian said <\s>
<s> pen longed for the three years to be over and surveyed the stucco halls and vast libraries and drawing rooms as already his own property <\s>
<s> the major laughed slyly to see the pompous airs of the simple young fellow as he strutted out of the building <\s>
<s> he and foker drove down in the latter's cab one day to the grey friars and renewed acquaintance with some of their old comrades there <\s>
<s> the boys came crowding up to the cab as it stood by the grey friars gates where they were entering and admired the chestnut horse and the tights and livery and gravity of stoopid the tiger <\s>
<s> the bell for afternoon school rang as they were swaggering about the play ground talking to their old cronies <\s>
<s> the awful doctor passed into school with his grammar in his hand <\s>
<s> foker slunk away uneasily at his presence but pen went up blushing and shook the dignitary by the hand <\s>
<s> he laughed as he thought that well remembered latin grammar had boxed his ears many a time <\s>
<s> he was generous good natured and in a word perfectly conceited and satisfied with himself <\s>
<s> then they drove to the parental brew house <\s>
<s> foker's entire is composed in an enormous pile of buildings not far from the grey friars and the name of that well known firm is gilded upon innumerable public house signs tenanted by its vassals in the neighbourhood and the venerable junior partner and manager did honour to the young lord of the vats and his friend and served them with silver flagons of brown stout so strong that you would have thought not only the young men but the very horse mr <\s>
<s> harry foker drove was affected by the potency of the drink for he rushed home to the west end of the town at a rapid pace which endangered the pie stalls and the women on the crossings and brought the cab steps into collision with the posts at the street corners and caused stoopid to swing fearfully on his board behind <\s>
<s> the major was quite pleased when pen was with his young acquaintance listened to mr <\s>
<s> foker's artless stories with the greatest interest gave the two boys a fine dinner at a covent garden coffee house whence they proceeded to the play but was above all happy when mr <\s>
<s> and lady agnes foker who happened to be in london requested the pleasure of major pendennis and mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis's company at dinner in grosvenor street <\s>
<s> having obtained the entree into lady agnes foker's house he said to pen with an affectionate solemnity which befitted the importance of the occasion it behoves you my dear boy to keep it <\s>
<s> you must mind and never neglect to call in grosvenor street when you come to london <\s>
<s> i recommend you to read up carefully in debrett the alliances and genealogy of the earls of rosherville and if you can to make some trifling allusions to the family something historical neat and complimentary and that sort of thing which you who have a poetic fancy can do pretty well <\s>
<s> foker himself is a worthy man though not of high extraction or indeed much education <\s>
<s> he always makes a point of having some of the family porter served round after dinner which you will on no account refuse and which i shall drink myself though all beer disagrees with me confoundedly <\s>
<s> and the heroic martyr did actually sacrifice himself as he said he would on the day when the dinner took place and old mr <\s>
<s> foker at the head of his table made his usual joke about foker's entire <\s>
<s> we should all of us i am sure have liked to see the major's grin when the worthy old gentleman made his time honoured joke <\s>
<s> lady agnes who wrapped up in harry was the fondest of mothers and one of the most good natured though not the wisest of women received her son's friend with great cordiality and astonished pen by accounts of the severe course of studies which her darling boy was pursuing and which she feared might injure his dear health <\s>
<s> foker the elder burst into a horse laugh at some of these speeches and the heir of the house winked his eye very knowingly at his friend <\s>
<s> and lady agnes then going through her son's history from the earliest time and recounting his miraculous sufferings in the measles and hooping cough his escape from drowning the shocking tyrannies practised upon him at that horrid school whither mr <\s>
<s> foker would send him because he had been brought up there himself and she never would forgive that disagreeable doctor no never lady agnes we say having prattled away for an hour incessantly about her son voted the two messieurs pendennis most agreeable men and when pheasants came with the second course which the major praised as the very finest birds he ever saw her ladyship said they came from logwood as the major knew perfectly well and hoped that they would both pay her a visit there at christmas or when dear harry was at home for the vacations <\s>
<s> god bless you my dear boy pendennis said to arthur as they were lighting their candles in bury street afterwards to go to bed <\s>
<s> you made that little allusion to agincourt where one of the roshervilles distinguished himself very neatly and well although lady agnes did not quite understand it but it was exceedingly well for a beginner though you oughtn't to blush so by the way and i beseech you my dear arthur to remember through life that with an entree with a good entree mind it is just as easy for you to have good society as bad and that it costs a man when properly introduced no more trouble or soins to keep a good footing in the best houses in london than to dine with a lawyer in bedford square <\s>
