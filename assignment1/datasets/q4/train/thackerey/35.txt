<s> but at the end of the season the earl of trehawk lord lieutenant of the county coming to eyrie castle and the countess dowager of rockminster whose son was also a magnate of the land to occupy a mansion on the marine parade at baymouth these great folks came publicly immediately and in state to call upon the family of clavering park and the carriages of the county families speedily followed in the track which had been left in the avenue by their lordly wheels <\s>
<s> it was then that mirobolant began to have an opportunity of exercising that skill which he possessed and of forgetting in the occupations of his art the pangs of love <\s>
<s> it was then that the large footmen were too much employed at clavering park to be able to bring messages or dally over the cup of small beer with the poor little maids at fairoaks <\s>
<s> it was then that blanche found other dear friends than laura and other places to walk in besides the river side where pen was fishing <\s>
<s> he came day after day and whipped the stream but the fish fish <\s>
<s> wouldn't do their duty nor the peri appear <\s>
<s> and here though in strict confidence and with a request that the matter go no further we may as well allude to a delicate business of which previous hint has been given <\s>
<s> mention has been made in a former page of a certain hollow tree at which pen used to take his station when engaged in his passion for miss fotheringay and the cavity of which he afterwards used for other purposes than to insert his baits and fishing cans in <\s>
<s> the truth is be converted this tree into a post office <\s>
<s> under a piece of moss and a stone he used to put little poems or letters equally poetical which were addressed to a certain undine or naiad who frequented the stream and which once or twice were replaced by a receipt in the shape of a flower or by a modest little word or two of acknowledgment written in a delicate hand in french or english and on pink scented paper <\s>
<s> certainly miss amory used to walk by this stream as we have seen and it is a fact that she used pink scented paper for her correspondence <\s>
<s> but after the great folks had invaded clavering park and the family coach passed out of the lodge gates evening after evening on their way to the other great country houses nobody came to fetch pen's letters at the post office the white paper was not exchanged for the pink but lay undisturbed under its stone and its moss whilst the tree was reflected into the stream and the brawl went rolling by <\s>
<s> there was not much in the letters certainly in the pink notes scarcely anything merely a little word or two half jocular half sympathetic such as might be written by any young lady <\s>
<s> but oh you silly pendennis if you wanted this one why did you not speak <\s>
<s> perhaps neither party was in earnest <\s>
<s> you were only playing at being in love and the sportive little undine was humouring you at the same play <\s>
<s> but if a man is baulked at this game he not unfrequently loses his temper and when nobody came any more for pen's poems he began to look upon those compositions in a very serious light <\s>
<s> he felt almost tragical and romantic again as in his first affair of the heart at any rate he was bent upon having an explanation <\s>
<s> one day he went to the hall and there was a roomful of visitors on another miss amory was not to be seen she was going to a ball that night and was lying down to take a little sleep <\s>
<s> pen cursed balls and the narrowness of his means and the humility of his position in the country that caused him to be passed over by the givers of these entertainments <\s>
<s> on a third occasion miss amory was in the garden and he ran thither she was walking there in state with no less personages than the bishop and bishopess of chatteris and the episcopal family who scowled at him and drew up in great dignity when he was presented to them and they heard his name <\s>
<s> the right reverend prelate had heard it before and also of the little transaction in the dean's garden <\s>
<s> the bishop says you're a sad young man good natured lady clavering whispered to him <\s>
<s> what have you been a doing of <\s>
<s> nothink i hope to vex such a dear mar as yours <\s>
<s> how is your dear mar <\s>
<s> why don't she come and me <\s>
<s> we an't seen her this ever such a time <\s>
<s> we're a goin about a gaddin so that we don't see no neighbours now <\s>
<s> give my love to her and laurar and come all to dinner to morrow <\s>
<s> pendennis was too unwell to come out but laura and pen came and there was a great party and pen only got an opportunity of a hurried word with miss amory <\s>
<s> you never come to the river now he said <\s>
<s> i can't said blanche the house is full of people <\s>
<s> undine has left the stream mr <\s>
<s> pen went on choosing to be poetical <\s>
<s> she never ought to have gone there miss amory answered <\s>
<s> she won't go again <\s>
<s> it was very foolish very wrong it was only play <\s>
<s> besides you have other consolations at home she added looking him full in the face an instant and dropping her eyes <\s>
<s> if he wanted her why did he not speak then <\s>
<s> she might have said yes even then <\s>
<s> but as she spoke of other consolations at home he thought of laura so affectionate and so pure and of his mother at home who had bent her fond heart upon uniting him with her adopted daughter <\s>
<s> he began in a vexed tone miss amory <\s>
<s> laura is looking at us mr <\s>
<s> pendennis the young lady said <\s>
<s> i must go back to the company and she ran off leaving mr <\s>
<s> pendennis to bite his nails in perplexity and to look out into the moonlight in the garden <\s>
<s> laura indeed was looking at pen <\s>
<s> she was talking with or appearing to listen to the talk of mr <\s>
<s> pynsent lord rockminster's son and grandson of the dowager lady who was seated in state in the place of honour gravely receiving lady clavering's bad grammar and patronising the vacuous sir francis whose interest in the county she was desirous to secure <\s>
<s> pynsent and pen had been at oxbridge together where the latter during his heyday of good fortune and fashion had been the superior of the young patrician and perhaps rather supercilious towards him <\s>
<s> they had met for the first time since they parted at the university at the table to day and given each other that exceedingly impertinent and amusing demi nod of recognition which is practised in england only and only to perfection by university men and which seems to say confound you what do you do here <\s>
<s> i knew that man at oxbridge mr <\s>
<s> pynsent said to miss bell a mr <\s>
<s> yes said miss bell <\s>
<s> he seems rather sweet upon miss amory the gentleman went on <\s>
<s> laura looked at them and perhaps thought so too but said nothing <\s>
<s> a man of large property in the county ain't he <\s>
<s> he used to talk about representing it <\s>
<s> he used to speak at the union <\s>
<s> whereabouts do his estates lie <\s>
<s> his estates lie on the other side of the river near the lodge gate <\s>
<s> he is my cousin and i live there <\s>
<s> pynsent with a laugh <\s>
<s> why on the other side of the river at fairoaks answered miss bell <\s>
<s> cover looks rather good said the simple gentleman <\s>
<s> we have nine hens and a cock a pig and an old pointer <\s>
<s> pendennis don't preserve then <\s>
<s> you should come and see him the girl said laughing and greatly amused at the notion that her pen was a great county gentleman and perhaps had given himself out to be such <\s>
<s> indeed i quite long to renew our acquaintance mr <\s>
<s> pynsent said gallantly and with a look which fairly said it is you that i would like to come and see to which look and speech miss laura vouchsafed a smile and made a little bow <\s>
<s> here blanche came stepping up with her most fascinating smile and ogle and begged dear laura to come and take the second in a song <\s>
<s> laura was ready to do anything good natured and went to the piano by which mr <\s>
<s> pynsent listened as long as the duet lasted and until miss amory began for herself when he strode away <\s>
<s> what a nice frank amiable well bred girl that is wagg said mr <\s>
<s> pynsent to a gentleman who had come over with him from baymouth the tall one i mean with the ringlets and red lips monstrous red ain't they <\s>
<s> what do you think of the girl of the house <\s>
<s> i think she's a lean scraggy humbug said mr <\s>
<s> pynsent with great candour <\s>
