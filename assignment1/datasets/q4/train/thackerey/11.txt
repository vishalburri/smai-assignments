<s> why said pen twiddling the stalks of the strawberries i i but this sentence never finished for pen's face was so comical and embarrassed as the major watched it that the elder could contain his gravity no longer and burst into a fit of laughter in which chorus pen himself was obliged to join after a minute when he broke out fairly into a guffaw <\s>

<s> when they had reached those apartments i suppose helen took to her knees as usual and pen read over his letters before going to bed just as if he didn't know every word of them by heart already <\s>

<s> 1 miss fotheringay presents grateful compliments to mr <\s>

<s> they will always be kept carefully and miss f <\s>
<s> will never forget the delightful evening which they passed on tuesday last <\s>
<s> 2 said dear sir we shall have a small quiet party of social friends at our humble board next tuesday evening at an early tea when i shall wear the beautiful scarf which with its accompanying delightful verses i shall ever ever cherish and papa bids me say how happy he will be if you will join the feast of reason and the flow of soul in our festive little party as i am sure will be your truly grateful emily fotheringay <\s>
<s> i'll go on the stage and act with her <\s>
<s> she she says i should do well there <\s>
<s> but will she take you on those terms <\s>
<s> mind i do not say that miss costigan is not the most disinterested of women but don't you suppose now fairly that your position as a young gentleman of ancient birth and decent expectations forms a part of the cause why she finds your addresses welcome <\s>
<s> i'll die i say rather than forfeit my pledge to her said pen doubling his fists and turning red <\s>
<s> who asks you my dear friend <\s>
<s> answered the imperturbable guardian <\s>
<s> no gentleman breaks his word of course when it has been given freely <\s>
<s> but after all you can wait <\s>
<s> you owe something to your mother something to your family something to me as your father's representative <\s>
<s> oh of course pen said feeling rather relieved <\s>
<s> well as you have pledged your word to her give us another will you arthur <\s>
<s> that you will make no private marriage that you won't be taking a trip to scotland you understand <\s>
<s> that would be a falsehood <\s>
<s> pen never told his mother a falsehood helen said <\s>
<s> pen hung down his head again and his eyes filled with tears of shame <\s>
<s> had not this whole intrigue been a falsehood to that tender and confiding creature who was ready to give up all for his sake <\s>
<s> he gave his uncle his hand <\s>
<s> no sir on my word of honour as a gentleman he said i will never marry without my mother's consent <\s>
<s> and giving helen a bright parting look of confidence and affection unchangeable the boy went out of the drawing room into his own study <\s>
<s> he's an angel he's an angel the mother cried out in one of her usual raptures <\s>
<s> he comes of a good stock ma'am said her brother in law of a good stock on both sides <\s>
<s> the major was greatly pleased with the result of his diplomacy so much so that he once more saluted the tips of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's glove and dropping the curt manly and straightforward tone in which he had conducted the conversation with the lad assumed a certain drawl which he always adopted when he was most conceited and fine <\s>
<s> my dear creature said he in that his politest tone i think it certainly as well that i came down and i flatter myself that last botte was a successful one <\s>
<s> i tell you how i came to think of it <\s>
<s> three years ago my kind friend lady ferrybridge sent for me in the greatest state of alarm about her son gretna whose affair you remember and implored me to use my influence with the young gentleman who was engaged in an affaire de coeur with a scotch clergyman's daughter miss mactoddy <\s>
<s> i implored i entreated gentle measures <\s>
<s> but lord ferrybridge was furious and tried the high hand <\s>
<s> gretna was sulky and silent and his parents thought they had conquered <\s>
<s> but what was the fact my dear creature <\s>
<s> the young people had been married for three months before lord ferrybridge knew anything about it <\s>
<s> and that was why i extracted the promise from master pen <\s>
<s> arthur would never have done so mrs <\s>
<s> he hasn't that is one comfort answered the brother in law <\s>
<s> like a wary and patient man of the world major pendennis did not press poor pen any farther for the moment but hoped the best from time and that the young fellow's eyes would be opened before long to see the absurdity of which he was guilty <\s>
<s> and having found out how keen the boy's point of honour was he worked kindly upon that kindly feeling with great skill discoursing him over their wine after dinner and pointing out to pen the necessity of a perfect uprightness and openness in all his dealings and entreating that his communications with his interesting young friend as the major politely called miss fotheringay should be carried on with the knowledge if not approbation of mrs <\s>
<s> after all pen the major said with a convenient frankness that did not displease the boy whilst it advanced the interests of the negotiator you must bear in mind that you are throwing yourself away <\s>
<s> your mother may submit to your marriage as she would to anything else you desired if you did but cry long enough for it but be sure of this that it can never please her <\s>
<s> you take a young woman off the boards of a country theatre and prefer her for such is the case to one of the finest ladies in england <\s>
<s> and your mother will submit to your choice but you can't suppose that she will be happy under it <\s>
