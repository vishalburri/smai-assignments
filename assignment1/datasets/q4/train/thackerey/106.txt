<s> the governor had arrived was at the somerset coffee house was in tolerable good humour something about the railway but he had been afraid to speak about about that business <\s>
<s> pendennis try it on <\s>
<s> pen said he would go and call at that moment upon mr <\s>
<s> huxter and see what might be done <\s>
<s> huxter junior would lurk outside whilst that awful interview took place <\s>
<s> the coronet on the carriage inspired his soul also with wonder and old mr <\s>
<s> huxter himself beheld it with delight as he looked from the coffee house window on that strand which it was always a treat to him to survey <\s>
<s> and i can afford to give myself a lark sir said mr <\s>
<s> huxter shaking hands with pen <\s>
<s> of course you know the news <\s>
<s> we have got our bill sir <\s>
<s> we shall have our branch line our shares are up sir and we buy your three fields along the brawl and put a pretty penny into your pocket mr <\s>
<s> indeed that was good news <\s>
<s> pen remembered that there was a letter from mr <\s>
<s> tatham at chambers these three days but he had not opened the communication being interested with other affairs <\s>
<s> i hope you don't intend to grow rich and give up practice said pen <\s>
<s> we can't lose you at clavering mr <\s>
<s> huxter though i hear very good accounts of your son <\s>
<s> goodenough speaks most highly of his talents <\s>
<s> it is hard that a man of your eminence though should be kept in a country town <\s>
<s> the metropolis would have been my sphere of action sir said mr <\s>
<s> huxter surveying the strand <\s>
<s> but a man takes his business where he finds it and i succeeded to that of my father <\s>
<s> it was my father's too said pen <\s>
<s> i sometimes wish i had followed it <\s>
<s> you sir have taken a more lofty career said the old gentleman <\s>
<s> you aspire to the senate and to literary honours <\s>
<s> you wield the poet's pen sir and move in the circles of fashion <\s>
<s> we keep an eye upon you at clavering <\s>
<s> we read your name in the lists of the select parties of the nobility <\s>
<s> why it was only the other day that my wife was remarking how odd it was that at a party at the earl of kidderminster's your name was not mentioned <\s>
<s> to what member of the aristocracy may i ask does that equipage belong from which i saw you descend <\s>
<s> the countess dowager of rockminster <\s>
<s> how is her ladyship <\s>
<s> her ladyship is not very well and when i heard that you were coming to town i strongly urged her to see you mr <\s>
<s> old huxter felt if he had a hundred votes for clavering he would give them all to pen <\s>
<s> there is an old friend of yours in the carriage a clavering lady too will you come out and speak to her <\s>
<s> the old surgeon was delighted to speak to a coroneted carriage in the midst of the full strand he ran out bowing and smiling <\s>
<s> huxter junior dodging about the district beheld the meeting between his father and laura saw the latter put out her hand and presently after a little colloquy with pen beheld his father actually jump into the carriage and drive away with miss bell <\s>
<s> there was no room for arthur who came back laughing to the young surgeon and told him whither his parent was bound <\s>
<s> during the whole of the journey that artful laura coaxed and wheedled and cajoled him so adroitly that the old gentleman would have granted her anything and lady rockminster achieved the victory over him by complimenting him on his skill and professing her anxiety to consult him <\s>
<s> what were her ladyship's symptoms <\s>
<s> should he meet her ladyship's usual medical attendant <\s>
<s> jones was called out of town <\s>
<s> he should be delighted to devote his very best energies and experience to her ladyship's service <\s>
<s> he was so charmed with his patient that he wrote home about her to his wife and family he talked of nothing but lady rockminster to samuel when that youth came to partake of beefsteak and oyster sauce and accompany his parent to the play <\s>
<s> there was a simple grandeur a polite urbanity a high bred grace about her ladyship which he had never witnessed in any woman <\s>
<s> her symptoms did not seem alarming he had prescribed spir ammon aromat with a little spir menth pip and orange flower which would be all that was necessary <\s>
<s> miss bell seemed to be on the most confidential and affectionate footing with her ladyship <\s>
<s> she was about to form a matrimonial connexion <\s>
<s> all young people ought to marry <\s>
<s> such were her ladyship's words and the countess condescended to ask respecting my own family and i mentioned you by name to her ladyship sam my boy <\s>
<s> i shall look in to morrow when if the remedies which i have prescribed for her ladyship have had the effect which i anticipate i shall probably follow them up by a little spir lavend comp and so set my noble patient up <\s>
<s> what is the theatre which is most frequented by the by the higher classes in town hey sam <\s>
<s> and to what amusement will you take an old country doctor to night hey sir <\s>
<s> on the next day when mr <\s>
<s> huxter called in jermyn street at twelve o'clock lady rockminster had not yet left her room but miss bell and mr <\s>
<s> pendennis were in waiting to receive him <\s>
<s> lady rockminster had had a most comfortable night and was getting on as well as possible <\s>
<s> what a capital piece it was and how charmingly mrs <\s>
<s> o'leary looked and sang it <\s>
<s> and what a good fellow young huxter was <\s>
<s> liked by everybody an honour to his profession <\s>
<s> he has not his father's manners i grant you or that old world tone which is passing away from us but a more excellent sterling fellow never lived <\s>
<s> he ought to practise in the country whatever you do sir said arthur he ought to marry other people are going to do so and settle <\s>
<s> the very words that her ladyship used yesterday mr <\s>
<s> he ought to marry <\s>
<s> sam should marry sir <\s>
<s> the town is full of temptations sir continued pen <\s>
<s> the old gentleman thought of that houri mrs <\s>
<s> there is no better safeguard for a young man than an early marriage with an honest affectionate creature <\s>
<s> no better sir no better <\s>
<s> and love is better than money isn't it <\s>
<s> indeed it is said miss bell <\s>
<s> i agree with so fair an authority said the old gentleman with a bow <\s>
<s> and and suppose sir pen said that i had a piece of news to communicate to you <\s>
<s> god bless my soul mr <\s>
<s> what do you mean <\s>
<s> asked the old gentleman <\s>
<s> suppose i had to tell you that a young man carried away by an irresistible passion for an admirable and most virtuous young creature whom everybody falls in love with had consulted the dictates of reason and his heart and had married <\s>
<s> suppose i were to tell you that that man is my friend that our excellent our truly noble friend the countess dowager of rockminster is truly interested about him and you may fancy what a young man can do in life when that family is interested for him ); suppose i were to tell you that you know him that he is here that he is sam married <\s>
<s> god bless my soul sir you don't mean that <\s>
