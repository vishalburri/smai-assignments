<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>

<s> true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuiced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencing master in dublin there's only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigan's getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr <\s>
<s> bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see <\s>

<s> pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six o'clock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation <\s>
<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> they seemed to warm his old sides <\s>
<s> faith sir said he the bullion's scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow <\s>
<s> i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther <\s>
<s> and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>

<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>

<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>
<s> he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs <\s>
<s> costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologised gave a dinner at the kildare street where six of them drank twinty one bottles of claret etc <\s>
<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>
<s> he winked at one or two tradesmen's shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to say see the company i'm in sure i'll pay you my boy and they parted finally with mr <\s>

<s> it had not as yet entered into the boy's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him <\s>
<s> costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man <\s>
<s> so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captain's arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion <\s>

<s> true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuiced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencing master in dublin there's only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigan's getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr <\s>
<s> bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see <\s>

<s> pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six o'clock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation <\s>
<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> they seemed to warm his old sides <\s>
<s> faith sir said he the bullion's scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow <\s>
<s> i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther <\s>
<s> and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>

<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>

<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>
<s> he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs <\s>
<s> costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologised gave a dinner at the kildare street where six of them drank twinty one bottles of claret etc <\s>
<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>
<s> he winked at one or two tradesmen's shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to say see the company i'm in sure i'll pay you my boy and they parted finally with mr <\s>

<s> it had not as yet entered into the boy's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him <\s>
<s> costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man <\s>
<s> so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captain's arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion <\s>

<s> true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuiced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencing master in dublin there's only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigan's getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr <\s>
<s> bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see <\s>

<s> pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six o'clock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation <\s>
<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> they seemed to warm his old sides <\s>
<s> faith sir said he the bullion's scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow <\s>
<s> i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther <\s>
<s> and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>

<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>

<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>
<s> he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs <\s>
<s> costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologised gave a dinner at the kildare street where six of them drank twinty one bottles of claret etc <\s>
<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>
<s> he winked at one or two tradesmen's shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to say see the company i'm in sure i'll pay you my boy and they parted finally with mr <\s>

<s> it had not as yet entered into the boy's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him <\s>
<s> costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man <\s>
<s> so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captain's arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion <\s>

<s> true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuiced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencing master in dublin there's only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigan's getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr <\s>
<s> bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see <\s>

<s> pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six o'clock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation <\s>
<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> they seemed to warm his old sides <\s>
<s> faith sir said he the bullion's scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow <\s>
<s> i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther <\s>
<s> and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>

<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>

<s> he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner <\s>
<s> she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more <\s>
<s> the poy arrived from the baker's in the hands of one of the little choir boy's brothers at the proper hour and at four o'clock pen found himself at dinner actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her father with the handsomest woman in all creation with his first and only love whom he had adored ever since when ever since yesterday ever since for ever <\s>
<s> now the captain's means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible <\s>

<s> if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story <\s>
<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>
<s> he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs <\s>
<s> costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologised gave a dinner at the kildare street where six of them drank twinty one bottles of claret etc <\s>
<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>
<s> he winked at one or two tradesmen's shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to say see the company i'm in sure i'll pay you my boy and they parted finally with mr <\s>

<s> it had not as yet entered into the boy's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him <\s>
<s> costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man <\s>
<s> so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captain's arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion <\s>

<s> but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth he was unable even to think it and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain <\s>
<s> he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world <\s>
<s> to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos <\s>
<s> he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always good natured and sometimes almost trustworthy <\s>
<s> up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any man's bill and his end was in a spunging house where the sheriff's officer who took him was fond of him <\s>
<s> in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders in chief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony <\s>
<s> what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours <\s>
<s> i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloat the wind raising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself the means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whisky and water all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out <\s>
<s> before he and pen had had a half hour's conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter's benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold <\s>
<s> pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter's delicacy <\s>

<s> and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast <\s>
<s> then it was good to see the captain's behaviour before the devilled turkey and the mutton chops <\s>
<s> his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men <\s>
<s> when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lord lieutenants he had ever known <\s>

<s> he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry <\s>
<s> altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he <\s>
<s> they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment <\s>

<s> it had not as yet entered into the boy's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him <\s>

<s> so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captain's arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion <\s>
