<s> the little lord slept all night through in spite of the squeezing and the horn blowing and the widow and he looked as fresh as paint and indeed pronounced himself to be so when the major with a yellow face a bristly beard a wig out of curl and strong rheumatic griefs shooting through various limbs of his uneasy body descended at the little lodge gate at fairoaks where the porteress and gardener's wife reverentially greeted him and still more respectfully mr <\s>
<s> helen was on the look out for this expected guest and saw him from her window <\s>
<s> but she did not come forward immediately to greet him <\s>
<s> she knew the major did not like to be seen at a surprise and required a little preparation before he cared to be visible <\s>
<s> pen when a boy had incurred sad disgrace by carrying off from the major's dressing table a little morocco box which it must be confessed contained the major's back teeth which he naturally would leave out of his jaws in a jolting mail coach and without which he would not choose to appear <\s>
<s> morgan his man made a mystery of mystery of his wigs curling them in private places introducing them mysteriously to his master's room nor without his head of hair would the major care to show himself to any member of his family or any acquaintance <\s>
<s> he went to his apartment then and supplied these deficiencies he groaned and moaned and wheezed and cursed morgan through his toilet as an old buck will who has been up all night with a rheumatism and has a long duty to perform <\s>
<s> and finally being belted curled and set straight he descended upon the drawing room with a grave majestic air such as befitted one who was at once a man of business and a man of fashion <\s>
<s> pen was not there however only helen and little laura sewing at her knees and to whom he never presented more than a forefinger as he did on this occasion after saluting his sister in law <\s>
<s> laura took the finger trembling and dropped it and then fled out of the room <\s>
<s> major pendennis did not want to keep her or indeed to have her in the house at all and had his private reason for disapproving of her which we may mention on some future occasion <\s>
<s> meanwhile laura disappeared and wandered about the premises seeking for pen whom she presently found in the orchard pacing up and down a walk there in earnest conversation with mr <\s>
<s> he was so occupied that he did not hear laura's clear voice singing out until smirke pulled him by the coat and pointed towards her as she came running <\s>
<s> she ran up and put her hand into his <\s>
<s> come in pen she said there's somebody come uncle arthur's come <\s>
<s> he is is he <\s>
<s> said pen and she felt him grasp her little hand <\s>
<s> he looked round at smirke with uncommon fierceness as much as to say i am ready for him or any man mr <\s>
<s> smirke cast up his eyes as usual and heaved a gentle sigh <\s>
<s> lead on laura pen said with a half fierce half comic air lead on and say i wait upon my uncle <\s>
<s> but he was laughing in order to hide a great anxiety and was screwing his courage inwardly to face the ordeal which he knew was now before him <\s>
<s> pen had taken smirke into his confidence in the last two days and after the outbreak attendant on the discovery of doctor portman and during every one of those forty eight hours which he had passed in mr <\s>
<s> smirke's society had done nothing but talk to his tutor about miss fotheringay miss emily fotheringay emily etc to all which talk smirke listened without difficulty for he was in love himself most anxious in all things to propitiate pen and indeed very much himself enraptured by the personal charms of this goddess whose like never having been before at a theatrical representation he had not beheld until now <\s>
<s> pen's fire and volubility his hot eloquence and rich poetical tropes and figures his manly heart kind ardent and hopeful refusing to see any defects in the person he loved any difficulties in their position that he might not overcome had half convinced mr <\s>
<s> smirke that the arrangement proposed by mr <\s>
<s> pen was a very feasible and prudent one and that it would be a great comfort to have emily settled at fairoaks captain costigan in the yellow room established for life there and pen married at eighteen <\s>
<s> and it is a fact that in these two days the boy had almost talked over his mother too had parried all her objections one after another with that indignant good sense which is often the perfection of absurdity and had brought her almost to acquiesce in the belief that if the marriage was doomed in heaven why doomed it was that if the young woman was a good person it was all that she for her part had to ask and rather to dread the arrival of the guardian uncle who she foresaw would regard mr <\s>
<s> pen's marriage in a manner very different to that simple romantic honest and utterly absurd way in which the widow was already disposed to look at questions of this sort <\s>
<s> for as in the old allegory of the gold and silver shield about which the two knights quarrelled each is right according to the point from which he looks so about marriage the question whether it is foolish or good wise or otherwise depends upon the point of view from which you regard it <\s>
<s> if it means a snug house in belgravia and pretty little dinner parties and a pretty little brougham to drive in the park and a decent provision not only for the young people but for the little belgravians to come and if these are the necessaries of life and they are with many honest people to talk of any other arrangement is an absurdity of love in lodgings a babyish folly of affection that can't pay coach hire or afford a decent milliner as mere wicked balderdash and childish romance <\s>
<s> if on the other hand your opinion is that people not with an assured subsistence but with a fair chance to obtain it and with the stimulus of hope health and strong affection may take the chance of fortune for better or worse and share its good or its evil together the polite theory then becomes an absurdity in its turn worse than an absurdity a blasphemy almost and doubt of providence and a man who waits to make his chosen woman happy until he can drive her to church in a neat little carriage with a pair of horses is no better than a coward or a trifler who is neither worthy of love nor of fortune <\s>
<s> i don't say that the town folks are not right but helen pendennis was a country bred woman and the book of life as she interpreted it told her a different story to that page which is read in cities <\s>
<s> like most soft and sentimental women matchmaking in general formed a great part of her thoughts and i daresay she had begun to speculate about her son's falling in love and marrying long before the subject had ever entered into the brains of the young gentleman <\s>
<s> it pleased her with that dismal pleasure which the idea of sacrificing themselves gives to certain women to think of the day when she would give up all to pen and he should bring his wife home and she would surrender the keys and the best bedroom and go and sit at the side of the table and see him happy <\s>
<s> what did she want in life but to see the lad prosper <\s>
<s> as an empress certainly was not too good for him and would be honoured by becoming mrs <\s>
<s> pen so if he selected humble esther instead of queen vashti she would be content with his lordship's choice <\s>
<s> never mind how lowly or poor the person might be who was to enjoy that prodigious honour mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis was willing to bow before her and welcome her and yield her up the first place <\s>
<s> but an actress a mature woman who had long ceased blushing except with rouge as she stood under the eager glances of thousands of eyes an illiterate and ill bred person very likely who must have lived with light associates and have heard doubtful conversation oh <\s>
<s> it was hard that such a one should be chosen and that the matron should be deposed to give place to such a sultana <\s>
<s> all these doubts the widow laid before pen during the two days which had of necessity to elapse ere the uncle came down but he met them with that happy frankness and ease which a young gentleman exhibits at his time of life and routed his mother's objections with infinite satisfaction to himself <\s>
<s> miss costigan was a paragon of virtue and delicacy she was as sensitive as the most timid maiden she was as pure as the unsullied snow she had the finest manners the most graceful wit and genius the most charming refinement and justness of appreciation in all matters of taste she had the most admirable temper and devotion to her father a good old gentleman of high family and fallen fortunes who had lived however with the best society in europe he was in no hurry and could afford to wait any time till he was one and twenty <\s>
<s> but he felt and here his face assumed an awful and harrowing solemnity that he was engaged in the one only passion of his life and that death alone could close it <\s>
<s> helen told him with a sad smile and shake of the head that people survived these passions and as for long engagements contracted between very young men and old women she knew an instance in her own family laura's poor father was an instance how fatal they were <\s>
<s> pen however was resolved that death must be his doom in case of disappointment and rather than this rather than baulk him in fact this lady would have submitted to any sacrifice or personal pain and would have gone down on her knees and have kissed the feet of a hottentot daughter in law <\s>
<s> arthur knew his power over the widow and the young tyrant was touched whilst he exercised it <\s>
<s> in those two days he brought her almost into submission and patronised her very kindly and he passed one evening with the lovely pie maker at chatteris in which he bragged of his influence over his mother and he spent the other night in composing a most flaming and conceited copy of verses to his divinity in which he vowed like montrose that he would make her famous with his sword and glorious by his pen and that he would love her as no mortal woman had been adored since the creation of womankind <\s>
<s> it was on that night long after midnight that wakeful helen passing stealthily by her son's door saw a light streaming through the chink of the door into the dark passage and heard pen tossing and tumbling and mumbling verses in his bed <\s>
<s> she waited outside for a while anxiously listening to him <\s>
<s> in infantile fevers and early boyish illnesses many a night before the kind soul had so kept watch <\s>
<s> she turned the lock very softly now and went in so gently that pen for a moment did not see her <\s>
<s> his face was turned from her <\s>
<s> his papers on his desk were scattered about and more were lying on the bed round him <\s>
<s> he was biting a pencil and thinking of rhymes and all sorts of follies and passions <\s>
<s> he was hamlet jumping into ophelia's grave he was the stranger taking mrs <\s>
<s> haller to his arms beautiful mrs <\s>
