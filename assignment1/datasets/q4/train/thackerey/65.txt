<s> didn't i ever tell you of it <\s>
<s> well i don't mind <\s>
<s> at first i was very cautious and having such a lot of money kept it close and lived like a gentleman colonel altamont meurice's hotel and that sort of thing never played except at the public tables and won more than i lost <\s>
<s> well sir there was a chap that i saw at the hotel and the palace royal too a regular swell fellow with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin bloundell bloundell his name was as i made acquaintance with somehow and he asked me to dinner and took me to madame the countess de foljambe's soirees such a woman strong such an eye <\s>
<s> such a hand at the pianner <\s>
<s> lor bless you she'd sit down and sing to you and gaze at you until she warbled your soul out of your body a'most <\s>
<s> she asked me to go to her evening parties every toosday and didn't i take opera boxes and give her dinners at the restauranteur's that's all <\s>
<s> but i had a run of luck at the tables and it was not in the dinners and opera boxes that poor clavering's money went <\s>
<s> no be hanged to it it was swept off in another way <\s>
<s> one night at the countess's there was several of us at supper mr <\s>
<s> bloundell bloundell the honourable deuceace the marky de la tour de force all tip top nobs sir and the height of fashion when we had supper and champagne you may be sure in plenty and then some of that confounded brandy <\s>
<s> i would have it i would it go on at it the countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me and we had cards as well as grog after supper and i played and drank until i don't know what i did <\s>
<s> i was like i was last night <\s>
<s> i was taken away and put to bed somehow and never woke until the next day to a roaring headache and to see my servant who said the honourable deuceace wanted to see me and was waiting in the sitting room <\s>
<s> how are you colonel <\s>
<s> says he a coming into my bedroom <\s>
<s> how long did you stay last night after i went away <\s>
<s> the play was getting too high for me and i'd lost enough to you for one night to me says i how's that my dear feller <\s>
<s> for though he was an earl's son we was as familiar as you and me <\s>
<s> how's that my dear feller <\s>
<s> says i and he tells me that he had borrowed thirty louis of me at vingt et un that he gave me an i o u <\s>
<s> for it the night before which i put into my pocket book before he left the room <\s>
<s> i takes out my card case it was the countess as worked it for me and there was the i o u <\s>
<s> sure enough and he paid me thirty louis in gold down upon the table at my bedside <\s>
<s> so i said he was a gentleman and asked him if he would like to take anything when my servant should get it for him but the honourable deuceace don't drink of a morning and he went away to some business which he said he had <\s>
<s> presently there's another ring at my outer door and this time it's bloundell bloundell and the marky that comes in <\s>
<s> bong jour marky says i <\s>
<s> so i said i had one and how i must have been uncommon queer the night afore but they both declared i didn't show no signs of having had too much but took my liquor as grave as a judge <\s>
<s> so says the marky deuceace has been with you we met him in the palais royal as we were coming from breakfast <\s>
<s> has he settled with you <\s>
<s> get it while you can he's a slippery card and as he won three ponies of bloundell i recommend you to get your money while he has some <\s>
<s> he has paid me says i but i knew no more than the dead that he owed me anything and don't remember a bit about lending him thirty louis <\s>
<s> the marky and bloundell looks and smiles at each other at this and bloundell says colonel you are a queer feller <\s>
<s> no man could have supposed from your manners that you had tasted anything stronger than tea all night and yet you forget things in the morning <\s>
<s> come come tell that to the marines my friend we won't have it at any price <\s>
<s> en efet says the marky twiddling his little black mustachios in the chimney glass and making a lunge or two as he used to do at the fencing school <\s>
<s> he was a wonder at the fencing school and i've seen him knock down the image fourteen times running at lepage's let us speak of affairs <\s>
<s> colonel you understand that affairs of honour are best settled at once perhaps it won't be inconvenient to you to arrange our little matters of last night <\s>
<s> do you owe me any money marky <\s>
<s> says he do not let us have any more jesting <\s>
<s> i have your note of hand for three hundred and forty louis <\s>
<s> says he taking out a paper from his pocket book <\s>
<s> and mine for two hundred and ten says bloundell bloundell and he pulls out his bit of paper <\s>
<s> i was in such a rage of wonder at this that i sprang out of bed and wrapped my dressing gown round me <\s>
<s> are you come here to make a fool of me <\s>
<s> i don't owe you two hundred or two thousand or two louis and i won't pay you a farthing <\s>
<s> do you suppose you can catch me with your notes of hand <\s>
<s> i laugh at em and at you and i believe you to be a couple <\s>
<s> a couple of what <\s>
<s> you of course are aware that we are a couple of men of honour colonel altamont and not come here to trifle or to listen to abuse from you <\s>
<s> you will either pay us or we will expose you as a cheat and chastise you as a cheat too says bloundell <\s>
<s> oui parbleu says the marky but i didn't mind him for i could have thrown the little fellow out of the window but it was different with bloundell he was a large man that weighs three stone more than me and stands six inches higher and i think he could have done for me <\s>
<s> monsieur will pay or monsieur will give me the reason why <\s>
<s> i believe you're little better than a polisson colonel altamont that was the phrase he used altamont said with a grin and i got plenty more of this language from the two fellows and was in the thick of the row with them when another of our party came in <\s>
<s> this was a friend of mine a gent i had met at boulogne and had taken to the countess's myself <\s>
<s> and as he hadn't played at all on the previous night and had actually warned me against bloundell and the others i told the story to him and so did the other two <\s>
<s> i am very sorry says he <\s>
<s> you would go on playing the countess entreated you to discontinue <\s>
<s> these gentlemen offered repeatedly to stop <\s>
<s> it was you that insisted on the large stakes not they <\s>
<s> in fact he charged dead against me and when the two others went away he told me how the marky would shoot me as sure as my name was was what it is <\s>
<s> i left the countess crying too said he <\s>
<s> she hates these two men she has warned you repeatedly against them which she actually had done and often told me never to play with them and now colonel i have left her in hysterics almost lest there should be any quarrel between you and that confounded marky should put a bullet through your head <\s>
<s> its my belief says my friend that that woman is distractedly in love with you <\s>
<s> do you think so <\s>
<s> says i upon which my friend told me how she had actually gone down on her knees to him and save colonel altamont <\s>
<s> as soon as i was dressed i went and called upon that lovely woman <\s>
<s> she gave a shriek and pretty near fainted when she saw me <\s>
<s> she called me ferdinand i'm blest if she didn't <\s>
<s> i thought your name was jack said strong with a laugh at which the colonel blushed very much behind his dyed whiskers <\s>
