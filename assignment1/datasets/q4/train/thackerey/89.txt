<s> so it came to pass that during the spring succeeding his mother's death he became a good deal under the influence of his uncle's advice and domesticated in lady clavering's house and in a measure was accepted by miss amory without being a suitor and was received without being engaged <\s>

<s> conversations our good natured begum was at first so much enraged at this last instance of her husband's duplicity and folly that she refused to give sir francis clavering any aid in order to meet his debts of honour and declared that she would separate from him and leave him to the consequences of his incorrigible weakness and waste <\s>
<s> after that fatal day's transactions at the derby the unlucky gambler was in such a condition of mind that he was disposed to avoid everybody alike his turf associates with whom he had made the debts which he trembled lest he should not have the means of paying and his wife his long suffering banker on whom he reasonably doubted whether he should be allowed any longer to draw <\s>
<s> when lady clavering asked the next morning whether sir francis was in the house she received answer that he had not returned that night but had sent a messenger to his valet ordering him to forward clothes and letters by the bearer <\s>

<s> short's establishment who carried clavering's message to grosvenor place and brought back his carpet bag was instantly aware who was the owner of the bag and he imparted his information to the footman who was laying the breakfast table who carried down the news to the servants' hall who took it to mrs <\s>
<s> bonner my lady's housekeeper and confidential maid who carried it to my lady <\s>
<s> and thus every single person in the grosvenor place establishment knew that sir francis was in hiding under the name of francis at an inn in the blackfriars road <\s>
<s> and sir francis's coachman told the news to other gentlemen's coachmen who carried it to their masters and to the neighbouring tattersall's where very gloomy anticipations were formed that sir francis clavering was about to make a tour in the levant <\s>
<s> in the course of that day the number of letters addressed to sir francis clavering bart which found their way to his hall table was quite remarkable <\s>

<s> in the afternoon of the day after the derby when strong after a colloquy with his principal at short's hotel whom he found crying and drinking curacoa called to transact business according to his custom at grosvenor place he found all these suspicious documents ranged in the baronet's study and began to open them and examine them with a rueful countenance <\s>
<s> bonner my lady's maid and housekeeper came down upon him whilst engaged in this occupation <\s>
