<s> foker had not come home at all <\s>
<s> here was a disappointment mr <\s>
<s> when she folded them over her bosom in resignation when she dropped them in mute agony or raised them in superb command when in sportive gaiety her hands fluttered and waved before her like what shall we say like the snowy doves before the chariot of venus it was with these arms and hands that she beckoned repelled entreated embraced her admirers no single one for she was armed with her own virtue and with her father's valour whose sword would have leapt from its scabbard at any insult offered to his child but the whole house which rose to her as the phrase was as she curtseyed and bowed and charmed it <\s>
<s> thus she stood for a minute complete and beautiful as pen stared at her <\s>
<s> i say pen isn't she a stunner <\s>
<s> pen said she's speaking <\s>
<s> she began her business in a deep sweet voice <\s>
<s> those who know the play of the stranger are aware that the remarks made by the various characters are not valuable in themselves either for their sound sense their novelty of observation or their poetic fancy <\s>
<s> in fact if a man were to say it was a stupid play he would not be far wrong <\s>
<s> nobody ever talked so <\s>
<s> if we meet idiots in life as will happen it is a great mercy that they do not use such absurdly fine words <\s>
<s> the stranger's talk is sham like the book he reads and the hair he wears and the bank he sits on and the diamond ring he makes play with but in the midst of the balderdash there runs that reality of love children and forgiveness of wrong which will be listened to wherever it is preached and sets all the world sympathising <\s>
<s> with what smothered sorrow with what gushing pathos mrs <\s>
<s> haller delivered her part <\s>
<s> at first when as count wintersen's housekeeper and preparing for his excellency's arrival she has to give orders about the beds and furniture and the dinner etc to be got ready she did so with the calm agony of despair <\s>
<s> but when she could get rid of the stupid servants and give vent to her feelings to the pit and the house she overflowed to each individual as if he were her particular confidant and she was crying out her griefs on his shoulder the little fiddler in the orchestra whom she did not seem to watch though he followed her ceaselessly twitched twisted nodded pointed about and when she came to the favourite passage i have a william too if he be still alive ah yes if he be still alive <\s>
<s> his little sisters too <\s>
<s> why fancy dost thou rack me so <\s>
<s> why dost thou image my poor children fainting in sickness and crying to to their mum um other when she came to this passage little bows buried his face in his blue cotton handkerchief after crying out bravo <\s>
<s> all the house was affected <\s>
<s> foker for his part taking out a large yellow bandanna wept piteously <\s>
<s> as for pen he was gone too far for that <\s>
<s> he followed the woman about and about when she was off the stage it and the house were blank the lights and the red officers reeled wildly before his sight <\s>
<s> he watched her at the side scene where she stood waiting to come on the stage and where her father took off her shawl when the reconciliation arrived and she flung herself down on mr <\s>
<s> bingley's shoulders whilst the children clung to their knees and the countess mrs <\s>
<s> bingley and baron steinforth performed with great liveliness and spirit by garbetts while the rest of the characters formed a group round them pen's hot eyes only saw fotheringay fotheringay <\s>
<s> the curtain fell upon him like a pall <\s>
<s> he did not hear a word of what bingley said who came forward to announce the play for the next evening and who took the tumultuous applause as usual for himself <\s>
<s> pen was not even distinctly aware that the house was calling for miss fotheringay nor did the manager seem to comprehend that anybody else but himself had caused the success of the play <\s>
