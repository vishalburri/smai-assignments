<s> i am sure he might be very happy with us <\s>
<s> don't agitate yourself so dear mother the girl answered <\s>
<s> i don't like to see you so <\s>
<s> you should not be sad because pen is unhappy here <\s>
<s> all men are so <\s>
<s> they must make themselves names and a place in the world <\s>
<s> look the two captains have fought and seen battles that mr <\s>
<s> pynsent who came here and who will be very rich is in a public office he works very hard he aspires to a name and a reputation <\s>
<s> he says pen was one of the best speakers at oxbridge and had as great a character for talent as any of the young gentlemen there <\s>
<s> pen himself laughs at mr <\s>
<s> wagg's celebrity and indeed he is a horrid person and says he is a dunce and that anybody could write his books <\s>
<s> i am sure they are odious and vulgar interposed the widow <\s>
<s> yet he has a reputation you see the county chronicle says the celebrated mr <\s>
<s> wagg has been sojourning at baymouth let our fashionables and eccentrics look out for something from his caustic pen <\s>
<s> if pen can write better than this gentleman and speak better than mr <\s>
<s> pynsent why doesn't he <\s>
<s> mamma he can't make speeches to us or distinguish himself here <\s>
<s> he ought to go away indeed he ought <\s>
<s> dear laura said helen taking the girl's hand <\s>
<s> is it kind of you to hurry him so <\s>
<s> i have been waiting <\s>
<s> i have been saving up money these many months to to pay back your advance to us <\s>
<s> laura cried embracing her friend hastily <\s>
<s> it was your money not mine <\s>
<s> never speak about that again <\s>
<s> how much money have you saved <\s>
<s> helen said there were more than two hundred pounds at the bank and that she would be enabled to pay off all laura's money by the end of the next year <\s>
<s> give it him let him have the two hundred pounds <\s>
<s> let him go to london and be a lawyer be something be worthy of his mother and of mine dearest mamma said the good girl upon which and with her usual tenderness and emotion the fond widow declared that laura was a blessing to her and the best of girls and i hope no one in this instance will be disposed to contradict her <\s>
<s> the widow and her daughter had more than one conversation on this subject and the elder gave way to the superior reason of the honest and stronger minded girl and indeed whenever there was a sacrifice to be made on her part this kind lady was only too eager to make it <\s>
<s> but she took her own way and did not loose sight of the end she had in view in imparting these new plans to pen <\s>
<s> one day she told him of these projects and it who that had formed them how it was laura who insisted upon his going to london and studying how it was laura who would not hear of the the money arrangements when he came back from oxbridge being settled just then how it was laura whom he had to thank if indeed he thought that he had to go <\s>
<s> at that news pen's countenance blazed up with pleasure and he hugged his mother to his heart with an ardour that i fear disappointed the fond lady but she rallied when he said by heaven <\s>
<s> she is a noble girl and may god almighty bless her mother <\s>
<s> i have been wearing myself away for months here longing to work and not knowing how <\s>
<s> i've been fretting over the thoughts of my shame and my debts and my past cursed extravagance and follies <\s>
<s> my heart has been half broken never mind about that <\s>
<s> if i can get a chance to redeem the past and to do my duty to myself and the best mother in the world indeed indeed i will <\s>
<s> i'll be worthy of you yet <\s>
<s> why isn't she here that i may go and thank her <\s>
<s> pen went on with more incoherent phrases paced up and down the room drank glasses of water jumped about his mother with a thousand embraces began to laugh began to sing was happier than she had seen him since he was a boy since he had tasted of the fruit of that awful tree of life which from the beginning has tempted all mankind <\s>
<s> laura was not at home <\s>
<s> laura was on a visit to the stately lady rockminster daughter to my lord bareacres sister to the late lady pontypool and by consequence a distant kinswoman of helen's as her ladyship who was deeply versed in genealogy was graciously to point out to the modest country lady <\s>
<s> pen was greatly delighted at the relationship being acknowledged though perhaps not over well pleased that lady rockminster took miss bell home with her for a couple of days to baymouth and did not make the slightest invitation to mr <\s>
<s> there was to be a ball at baymouth and it was to be miss laura's first appearance <\s>
<s> the dowager came to fetch her in her carriage and she went off with a white dress in her box happy and blushing like the rose to which pen compared her <\s>
<s> this was the night of the ball a public entertainment at the baymouth hotel <\s>
<s> said pen i'll ride over no i won't ride but i'll go too <\s>
<s> his mother was charmed that he should do so and as he was debating about the conveyance in which he should start for baymouth captain strong called opportunely said he was going himself and that he would put his horse the butcher boy into the gig and drive pen over <\s>
<s> when the grand company began to fill the house at clavering park the chevalier strong who as his patron said was never in the way or out of it seldom intruded himself upon its society but went elsewhere to seek his relaxation <\s>
<s> i've seen plenty of grand dinners in my time he said and dined by jove in a company where there was a king and royal duke at top and bottom and every man along the table had six stars on his coat but dammy glanders this finery don't suit me and the english ladies with their confounded buckram airs and the squires with their politics after dinner send me to sleep sink me dead if they don't <\s>
<s> i like a place where i can blow my cigar when the cloth is removed and when i'm thirsty have my beer in its native pewter <\s>
<s> so on a gala day at clavering park the chevalier would content himself with superintending the arrangements of the table and drilling the major domo and servants and having looked over the bill of fare with monsieur mirobolant would not care to take the least part in the banquet <\s>
<s> send me up a cutlet and a bottle of claret to my room this philosopher would say and from the windows of that apartment which commanded the terrace and avenue he would survey the company as they arrived in their carriages or take a peep at the ladies in the hall through an oeil de boeuf which commanded it from his corridor <\s>
<s> and the guests being seated strong would cross the park to captain glanders's cottage at clavering or to pay the landlady a visit at the clavering arms or to drop in upon madame fribsby over her novel and tea <\s>
<s> wherever the chevalier went he was welcome and whenever he came away a smell of hot brandy and water lingered behind him <\s>
<s> the butcher boy not the worst horse in sir francis's stable was appropriated to captain strong's express use and the old campaigner saddled him or brought him home at all hours of the day or night and drove or rode him up and down the country <\s>
<s> where there was a public house with a good tap of beer where there was a tenant with a pretty daughter who played on the piano to chatteris to the play or the barracks to baymouth if any fun was on foot there to the rural fairs or races the chevalier and his brown horse made their way continually and this worthy gentleman lived at free quarters in a friendly country <\s>
<s> the butcher boy soon took pen and the chevalier to baymouth <\s>
<s> the latter was as familiar with the hotel and landlord there as with every other inn round about and having been accommodated with a bedroom to dress they entered the ballroom <\s>
<s> the chevalier was splendid <\s>
<s> he wore three little gold crosses in a brochette on the portly breast of his blue coat and looked like a foreign field marshal <\s>
<s> the ball was public and all sorts of persons were admitted and encouraged to come young pynsent having views upon the county and lady rockminster being patroness of the ball <\s>
<s> there was a quadrille for the aristocracy at one end and select benches for the people of fashion <\s>
<s> towards this end the chevalier did not care to penetrate far as he said he did not care for the nobs ); but in the other part of the room he knew everybody the wine merchants innkeepers tradesmen's solicitors squire farmers daughters their sires and brothers and plunged about shaking hands <\s>
<s> who is that man with the blue ribbon and the three pointed star <\s>
<s> a gentleman in black with ringlets and a tuft stood gazing fiercely about him with one hand in the arm hole of his waistcoat and the other holding his claque <\s>
<s> by jupiter it's mirobolant <\s>
<s> cried strong bursting out laughing <\s>
<s> bon jour chef bon jour chevalier <\s>
<s> de la croix de juillet chevalier <\s>
<s> said the chef laying his hand on his decoration <\s>
<s> by jove here's some more ribbon <\s>
<s> a man with very black hair and whiskers dyed evidently with the purple of tyre with twinkling eyes and white eyelashes and a thousand wrinkles in his face which was of a strange red colour with two under vests and large gloves and hands and a profusion of diamonds and jewels in his waistcoat and stock with coarse feet crumpled into immense shiny boots and a piece of parti coloured ribbon in his button hole here came up and nodded familiarly to the chevalier <\s>
<s> the chevalier shook hands <\s>
<s> colonel altamont of the bodyguard of his highness the nawaub of lucknow <\s>
<s> that officer bowed to the salute of pen who was now looking out eagerly to see if the person wanted had entered the room <\s>
<s> but the band began presently performing see the conquering hero comes and a host of fashionables dowager countess of rockminster mr <\s>
<s> pynsent and miss bell sir francis clavering bart of clavering park lady clavering and miss amory sir horace fogey bart lady fogey colonel and mrs <\s>
<s> as the county paper afterwards described them entered the room <\s>
<s> pen rushed by blanche ran up to laura and seized her hand <\s>
<s> he said i want to speak to you i must speak to you let me dance with you <\s>
<s> not for three dances dear pen she said smiling and he fell back biting his nails with vexation and forgetting to salute pynsent <\s>
<s> after lady rockminster's party lady clavering's followed in the procession <\s>
<s> colonel altamont eyed it hard holding a most musky pocket handkerchief up to his face and bursting with laughter behind it <\s>
<s> who's the gal in green along with em cap'n <\s>
<s> he asked of strong <\s>
<s> that's miss amory lady clavering's daughter replied the chevalier <\s>
<s> the colonel could hardly contain himself for laughing <\s>
<s> contains some ball practising under some calico draperies in the shady embrasure of a window arthur pendennis chose to assume a very gloomy and frowning countenance and to watch miss bell dance her first quadrille with mr <\s>
<s> pynsent for a partner <\s>
<s> that gentleman was as solemn and severe as englishmen are upon such occasions and walked through the dance as he would have walked up to his pew in church without a smile upon his face or allowing any outward circumstance to interfere with his attention to the grave duty in which he was engaged <\s>
<s> but miss laura's face was beaming with pleasure and good nature <\s>
<s> the lights and the crowd and music excited her <\s>
<s> as she spread out her white robes and performed her part of the dance smiling and happy her brown ringlets flowing back over her fair shoulders from her honest rosy face more than one gentleman in the room admired and looked after her and lady fogey who had a house in london and gave herself no small airs of fashion when in the country asked of lady rockminster who the young person was mentioned a reigning beauty in london whom in her ladyship's opinion laura was rather like and pronounced that she would do <\s>
<s> lady rockminster would have been very much surprised if any protegee of hers would not do and wondered at lady fogey's impudence in judging upon the point at all <\s>
<s> she surveyed laura with majestic glances through her eyeglass <\s>
<s> she was pleased with the girl's artless looks and gay innocent manner <\s>
<s> her manner is very good her ladyship thought <\s>
<s> her arms are rather red but that is a defect of her youth <\s>
