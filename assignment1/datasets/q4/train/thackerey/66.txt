<s> no says i they won't for i will not let that scamp of a marquis send me out of the world and if he lays a hand on me i'll brain him marquis as he is <\s>
<s> at this the countess shrank back from me as if i had said something very shocking <\s>

<s> good bye sir and she was sweeping out of the room her voice regular choking in her pocket handkerchief <\s>
<s> says i rushing after her and seizing her hand <\s>
<s> leave me monsieur le colonel says she shaking me off my father was a general of the grand army <\s>
<s> a soldier should know how to pay all his debts of honour <\s>
<s> what could i do <\s>
<s> everybody was against me <\s>
<s> caroline said i had lost the money though i didn't remember a syllable about the business <\s>
<s> i had taken deuceace's money too but then it was because he offered it to me you know and that's a different thing <\s>
<s> every one of these chaps was a man of fashion and honour and the marky and the countess of the first families in france <\s>
<s> and by jove sir rather than offend her i paid the money up five hundred and sixty gold napoleons by jove besides three hundred which i lost when i had my revenge <\s>
<s> and i can't tell you at this minute whether i was done or not concluded the colonel musing <\s>
<s> sometimes i think i was but then caroline was so fond of me <\s>
<s> that woman would never have seen me done never i'm sure she wouldn't at least if she would i'm deceived in woman <\s>
<s> any further revelations of his past life which altamont might have been disposed to confide to his honest comrade the chevalier were interrupted by a knocking at the outer door of their chambers which when opened by grady the servant admitted no less a person than sir francis clavering into the presence of the two worthies <\s>
<s> the governor by jove cried strong regarding the arrival of his patron with surprise <\s>
<s> what's brought you here <\s>
<s> growled altamont looking sternly from under his heavy eyebrows at the baronet <\s>
<s> it's no good i warrant <\s>
<s> and indeed good very seldom brought sir francis clavering into that or any other place <\s>
<s> whenever he came into shepherd's inn it was money that brought the unlucky baronet into those precincts and there was commonly a gentleman of the money dealing world in waiting for him at strong's chambers or at campion's below and a question of bills to negotiate or to renew <\s>
<s> claverng was a man who had never looked his debts fairly in the face familiar as he had been with them all his life as long as he could renew a bill his mind was easy regarding it and he would sign almost anything for to morrow provided to day could be left unmolested <\s>
<s> he was a man whom scarcely any amount of fortune could have benefited permanently and who was made to be ruined to cheat small tradesmen to be the victim of astuter sharpers to be niggardly and reckless and as destitute of honesty as the people who cheated him and a dupe chiefly because he was too mean to be a successful knave <\s>
<s> he had told more lies in his time and undergone more baseness of stratagem in order to stave off a small debt or to swindle a poor creditor than would have sufficed to make a fortune for a braver rogue <\s>
