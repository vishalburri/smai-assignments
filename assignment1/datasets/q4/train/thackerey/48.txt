<s> you would be the very man to help us with a genuine west end article you understand dashing trenchant and d aristocratic <\s>
<s> lady hipshaw will write but she's not much you know and we've two lords but the less they do the better <\s>
<s> we must have you <\s>
<s> we'll give you your own terms and we'll make a hit with the gazette <\s>
<s> come and see you or can you look in upon me here ever yours c <\s>
<s> some more opposition warrington said when pen had read the note <\s>
<s> bungay and bacon are at daggers drawn each married the sister of the other and they were for some time the closest friends and partners <\s>
<s> hack says it was mrs <\s>
<s> bungay who caused all the mischief between the two whereas shandon who reads for bungay a good deal says mrs <\s>
<s> bacon did the business but i don't know which is right peachum or lockit <\s>
<s> but since they have separated it is a furious war between the two publishers and no sooner does one bring out a book of travels or poems a magazine or periodical quarterly or monthly or weekly or annual but the rival is in the field with something similar <\s>
<s> i have heard poor shandon tell with great glee how he made bungay give a grand dinner at blackwall to all his writers by saying that bacon had invited his corps to an entertainment at greenwich <\s>
<s> when bungay engaged your celebrated friend mr <\s>
<s> wagg to edit the londoner bacon straightway rushed off and secured mr <\s>
<s> grindle to give his name to the westminster magazine <\s>
<s> when bacon brought out his comic irish novel of barney brallaghan off went bungay to dublin and produced his rollicking hibernian story of looney mactwolter <\s>
<s> when doctor hicks brought out his wanderings in mesopotamia under bacon's auspices bungay produced professor sandiman's researches in zahara and bungay is publishing his pall mall gazette as a counterpoise to bacon's whitehall review <\s>
<s> let us go and hear about the gazette <\s>
<s> there may be a place for you in it pen my boy <\s>
<s> we will go and see shandon <\s>
<s> we are sure to find him at home <\s>
<s> where does he live <\s>
<s> in the fleet prison warrington said <\s>
<s> and very much at home he is there too <\s>
<s> he is the king of the place <\s>
<s> pen had never seen this scene of london life and walked with no small interest in at the grim gate of that dismal edifice <\s>
<s> they went through the anteroom where the officers and janitors of the place were seated and passing in at the wicket entered the prison <\s>
<s> the noise and the crowd the life and the shouting the shabby bustle of the place struck and excited pen <\s>
<s> people moved about ceaselessly and restless like caged animals in a menagerie <\s>
<s> men were playing at fives <\s>
<s> others pacing and tramping this one in colloquy with his lawyer in dingy black that one walking sadly with his wife by his side and a child on his arm <\s>
<s> some were arrayed in tattered dressing gowns and had a look of rakish fashion <\s>
<s> everybody seemed to be busy humming and on the move <\s>
<s> pen felt as if he choked in the place and as if the door being locked upon him they never would let him out <\s>
<s> they went through a court up a stone staircase and through passages full of people and noise and cross lights and black doors clapping and banging pen feeling as one does in a feverish morning dream <\s>
<s> at last the same little runner who had brought shandon's note and had followed them down fleet street munching apples and who showed the way to the two gentlemen through the prison said this is the captain's door and mr <\s>
<s> shandon's voice from within bade them enter <\s>
<s> the room though bare was not uncheerful <\s>
<s> the sun was shining in at the window near which sate a lady at work who had been gay and beautiful once but in whose faded face kindness and tenderness still beamed <\s>
<s> through all his errors and reckless mishaps and misfortunes this faithful creature adored her husband and thought him the best and cleverest as indeed he was one of the kindest of men <\s>
<s> nothing ever seemed to disturb the sweetness of his temper not debts not duns not misery not the bottle not his wife's unhappy position or his children's ruined chances <\s>
<s> he was perfectly fond of wife and children after his fashion he always had the kindest words and smiles for them and ruined them with the utmost sweetness of temper <\s>
<s> he never could refuse himself or any man any enjoyment which his money could purchase he would share his last guinea with jack and tom and we may be sure he had a score of such retainers <\s>
<s> he would sign his name at the back of any man's bill and never pay any debt of his own <\s>
<s> he would write on any side and attack himself or another man with equal indifference <\s>
<s> he was one of the wittiest the most amiable and the most incorrigible of irishmen <\s>
<s> nobody could help liking charley shandon who saw him once and those whom he ruined could scarcely be angry with him <\s>
<s> when pen and warrington arrived the captain he had been in an irish militia regiment once and the title remained with him was sitting on his bed in a torn dressing gown with a desk on his knees at which he was scribbling as fast as his rapid pen could write <\s>
<s> slip after slip of paper fell off the desk wet on to the ground <\s>
<s> a picture of his children was hung up over his bed and the youngest of them was pattering about the room <\s>
<s> opposite the captain sate mr <\s>
<s> bungay a portly man of stolid countenance with whom the little child had been trying a conversation <\s>
<s> papa's a very clever man said she mamma says so <\s>
<s> oh very said mr <\s>
<s> and you're a very rich man mr <\s>
<s> bundy cried the child who could hardly speak plain <\s>
<s> said mamma from her work <\s>
<s> oh never mind bungay roared out with a great laugh no harm in saying i'm rich he he i am pretty well off my little dear <\s>
<s> if you're rich why don't you take papa out of piz'n <\s>
<s> mamma at this began to wipe her eyes with the work on which she was employed <\s>
<s> the poor lady had hung curtains up in the room had brought the children's picture and placed it there and had made one or two attempts to ornament it mamma began to cry mr <\s>
<s> bungay turned red and looked fiercely out of his bloodshot little eyes shandon's pen went on and pen and warrington arrived with their knock <\s>
<s> captain shandon looked up from his work <\s>
<s> how do you do mr <\s>
<s> i'll speak to you in a minute <\s>
<s> please sit down gentlemen if you can find places and away went the pen again <\s>
<s> warrington pulled forward an old portmanteau the only available seat and sate down on it with a bow to mrs <\s>
<s> shandon and a nod to bungay the child came and looked at pen solemnly and in a couple of minutes the swift scribbling ceased and shandon turning the desk over on the bed stooped and picked up the papers <\s>
<s> i think this will do said he <\s>
<s> it's the prospectus for the pall mall gazette <\s>
<s> and here's the money for it mr <\s>
<s> bungay said laying down a five pound note <\s>
<s> i'm as good as my word i am <\s>
<s> when i say i'll pay i pay <\s>
<s> faith that's more than some of us can say said shandon and he eagerly clapped the note into his pocket <\s>
<s> which is passed in the neighbourhood of ludgate hill our imprisoned captain announced in smart and emphatic language in his prospectus that the time had come at last when it was necessary for the gentlemen of england to band together in defence of their common rights and their glorious order menaced on all sides by foreign revolutions by intestine radicalism by the artful calumnies of mill owners and cotton lords and the stupid hostility of the masses whom they gulled and led <\s>
<s> the ancient monarchy was insulted the captain said by a ferocious republican rabble <\s>
<s> the church was deserted by envious dissent and undermined by stealthy infidelity <\s>
<s> the good institutions which had made our country glorious and the name of english gentleman the proudest in the world were left without defence and exposed to assault and contumely from men to whom no sanctuary was sacred for they believed in nothing holy no history venerable for they were too ignorant to have heard of the past and no law was binding which they were strong enough to break when their leaders gave the signal for plunder <\s>
<s> it was because the kings of france mistrusted their gentlemen mr <\s>
<s> shandon remarked that the monarchy of saint louis went down it was because the people of england still believed in their gentlemen that this country encountered and overcame the greatest enemy a nation ever met it was because we were headed by gentlemen that the eagles retreated before us from the donro to the garonne it was a gentleman who broke the line at trafalgar and swept the plain of waterloo <\s>
