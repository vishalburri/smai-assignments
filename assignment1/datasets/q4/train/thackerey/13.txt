<s> you must feel my dear sir as a man of the world how fatal to my nephew's prospects in life is this step which he contemplates and how eager we all must be to free him from this absurd engagement <\s>
<s> he has come out uncommon strong said mr <\s>
<s> foker i have seen his verses rouncy copied em <\s>
<s> and i said to myself when i saw em catch me writin verses to a woman that's all he has made a fool of himself as many a good fellow has before him <\s>

<s> two thousand a year hasn't he got two thousand a year the general says he has <\s>
<s> my dear friend shrieked out the major with an eagerness which this gentleman rarely showed thank you thank you i begin to see now two thousand a year <\s>

<s> and you ain't going to leave him anything <\s>
<s> the major had sunk every shilling he could scrape together on an annuity and of course was going to leave pen nothing but he did not tell foker this <\s>
<s> how much do you think a major on half pay can save <\s>
<s> if these people have been looking at him as a fortune they are utterly mistaken and and you have made me the happiest man in the world <\s>
<s> sir to you said mr <\s>
<s> foker politely and when they parted for the night they shook hands with the greatest cordiality the younger gentleman promising the elder not to leave chatteris without a further conversation in the morning <\s>

<s> i'm going to fight the dragon he said with a laugh to doctor portman <\s>
<s> and i shrive you sir and bid good fortune go with you answered the doctor <\s>
<s> perhaps he and mrs <\s>
<s> portman and miss myra as they sate with their friend the dean's lady in her drawing room looked up more than once at the enemy's window to see if they could perceive any signs of the combat <\s>
<s> the major walked round according to the directions given him and soon found mrs <\s>
<s> he passed it and as he ascended to captain costigan's apartment he could hear a stamping of feet and a great shouting of ha ha <\s>
<s> it's sir derby oaks taking his fencing lesson said the child who piloted major pendennis <\s>
<s> he takes it mondays wednesdays and fridays <\s>
<s> the major knocked and at length a tall gentleman came forth with a foil and mask in one hand and a fencing glove on the other <\s>
<s> pendennis made him a deferential bow <\s>
<s> i believe i have the honour of speaking to captain costigan my name is major pendennis <\s>
<s> the captain brought his weapon up to the salute and said major the honer is moine i'm deloighted to see ye <\s>
<s> negotiation the major and captain costigan were old soldiers and accustomed to face the enemy so we may presume that they retained their presence of mind perfectly but the rest of the party assembled in cos's sitting room were perhaps a little flurried at pendennis's apparition <\s>
<s> miss fotheringay's slow heart began to beat no doubt for her cheek flushed up with a great healthy blush as lieutenant sir derby oaks looked at her with a scowl <\s>
<s> and many more too <\s>
<s> we were talking about it at mess yesterday and chaffing derby oaks until he was as mad as a hatter <\s>
<s> know sir derby oaks <\s>
<s> we dined together and he went to the play we were standing at the door smoking i remember when you passed in to dinner <\s>
<s> i remember sir thomas oaks his father before he was a baronet or a knight he lived in cavendish square and was physician to queen charlotte <\s>
<s> the young one is making the money spin i can tell you mr <\s>
<s> and is sir derby oaks the major said with great delight and anxiety another soupirant <\s>
<s> another admirer of miss fotheringay <\s>
<s> we call him mondays wednesdays and fridays and pen tuesdays thursdays and saturdays <\s>
<s> but mind you nothing wrong <\s>
<s> is a deal too wide awake for that major pendennis <\s>
<s> she plays one off against the other <\s>
<s> what you call two strings to her bow <\s>
<s> i think you seem tolerably wide awake too mr <\s>
<s> foker pendennis said laughing <\s>
<s> pretty well thank you sir how are you <\s>
<s> i'm not clever p'raps but i am rather downy and partial friends say i know what's o'clock tolerably well <\s>
<s> can i tell you the time of day in any way <\s>
<s> upon my word the major answered quite delighted i think you may be of very great service to me <\s>
<s> you are a young man of the world and with such one likes to deal <\s>
<s> and as such i need not inform you that our family is by no means delighted at this absurd intrigue in which arthur is engaged <\s>
<s> i should rather think not said mr <\s>
<s> too much beer drunk on the premises <\s>
<s> no irish need apply <\s>
<s> that i take to be your meaning <\s>
<s> the major said it was exactly though in truth he did not quite understand what mr <\s>
<s> foker's meaning was and he proceeded to examine his new acquaintance regarding the amiable family into which his nephew proposed to enter and soon got from the candid witness a number of particulars regarding the house of costigan <\s>
<s> we must do mr <\s>
<s> foker the justice to say that he spoke most favourably of mr <\s>
<s> and miss costigan's moral character <\s>
<s> you see said he i think the general is fond of the jovial bowl and if i wanted to be very certain of my money it isn't in his pocket i'd invest it but he has always kept a watchful eye on his daughter and neither he nor she will stand anything but what's honourable <\s>
<s> pen's attentions to her are talked about in the whole company and i hear all about them from a young lady who used to be very intimate with her and with whose family i sometimes take tea in a friendly way <\s>
<s> miss rouncy says sir derby oaks has been hanging about miss fotheringay ever since his regiment has been down here but pen has come in and cut him out lately which has made the baronet so mad that he has been very near on the point of proposing too <\s>
<s> wish he would and you'd see which of the two miss fotheringay would jump at <\s>
<s> i thought as much the major said <\s>
<s> you give me a great deal of pleasure mr <\s>
<s> i wish i could have seen you before <\s>
<s> didn't like to put in my oar replied the other <\s>
<s> don't speak till i'm asked when if there's no objections i speak pretty freely <\s>
<s> heard your man had been hankering about my servant didn't know myself what was going on until miss fotheringay and miss rouncy had the row about the ostrich feathers when miss r <\s>
<s> miss rouncy i gather was the confidante of the other <\s>
<s> why she's twice as clever a girl as fotheringay and literary and that while miss foth can't do much more than read <\s>
<s> she can write said the major remembering pen's breast pocket <\s>
<s> foker broke out into a sardonic he he <\s>
<s> rouncy writes her letters he said every one of em and since they've quarrelled she don't know how the deuce to get on <\s>
<s> miss rouncy is an uncommon pretty hand whereas the old one makes dreadful work of the writing and spelling when bows ain't by <\s>
<s> rouncy's been settin her copies lately she writes a beautiful hand rouncy does <\s>
<s> i suppose you know it pretty well said the major archly upon which mr <\s>
<s> foker winked at him again <\s>
<s> i would give a great deal to have a specimen of her hand writing continued major pendennis i dare say you could give me one <\s>
<s> no no that would be too bad foker replied <\s>
<s> perhaps i oughtn't to have said as much as i have <\s>
<s> miss f s writin ain't so very bad i dare say only she got miss r <\s>
<s> to write the first letter and has gone on ever since <\s>
<s> but you mark my word that till they are friends again the letters will stop <\s>
