<s> they walked up the great moss grown steps to the hall door and a foreign attendant with earrings and a gold laced cap pulled strenuously at the great bell handle at the cracked and sculptured gate <\s>
<s> the bell was heard clanging loudly through the vast gloomy mansion <\s>
<s> steps resounded presently upon the marble pavement of the hall within and the doors opened and finally mrs <\s>
<s> blenkinsop the housekeeper polly her aide de camp and smart the keeper appeared bowing humbly <\s>
<s> smart the keeper pulled the wisp of hay coloured hair which adorned his sunburnt forehead kicked out his left heel as if there were a dog biting at his calves and brought down his head to a bow <\s>
<s> old mrs blenkinsop dropped a curtsey <\s>
<s> helen stirred and said yes i'm awake <\s>
<s> the truth is though she had been lying quite still and silent she had not been asleep one instant but had been looking at the night lamp in the chimney and had been thinking of pen for hours and hours <\s>
<s> then miss laura who had been acting with similar hypocrisy and lying occupied with her own thoughts as motionless as helen's brooch with pen's and laura's hair in it on the frilled white pincushion on the dressing table began to tell mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis of a notable plan which she had been forming in her busy little brains and by which all pen's embarrassments would be made to vanish in a moment and without the least trouble to anybody <\s>
<s> you know mamma this young lady said that i have been living with you for ten years during which time you have never taken any of my money and have been treating me just as if i was a charity girl <\s>
<s> now this obligation has offended me very much because i am proud and do not like to be beholden to people <\s>
<s> and as if i had gone to school only i wouldn't it must have cost me at least fifty pounds a year it is clear that i owe you fifty times ten pounds which i know you have put in the bank at chatteris for me and which doesn't belong to me a bit <\s>
<s> now to morrow we will go to chatteris and see that nice old mr <\s>
<s> rowdy with the bald head and ask him for it not for his head but for the five hundred pounds and i dare say he will send you two more which we will save and pay back and we will send the money to pen who can pay all his debts without hurting anybody and then we will live happy ever after <\s>
<s> what helen replied to this speech need not be repeated as the widow's answer was made up of a great number of incoherent ejaculations embraces and other irrelative matter <\s>
<s> but the two women slept well after that talk and when the night lamp went out with a splutter and the sun rose gloriously over the purple hills and the birds began to sing and pipe cheerfully amidst the leafless trees and glistening evergreens on fairoaks lawn helen woke too and as she looked at the sweet face of the girl sleeping beside her her lips parted with a smile blushes on her cheeks her spotless bosom heaving and falling with gentle undulations as if happy dreams were sweeping over it pen's mother felt happy and grateful beyond all power of words save such as pious women offer up to the beneficent dispenser of love and mercy in whose honour a chorus of such praises is constantly rising up all round the world <\s>
<s> although it was january and rather cold weather so sincere was mr <\s>
<s> pen's remorse and so determined his plans of economy that he would not take an inside place in the coach but sate up behind with his friend the guard who remembered his former liberality and lent him plenty of great coats <\s>
<s> perhaps it was the cold that made his knees tremble as he got down at the lodge gate or it may be that he was agitated at the notion of seeing the kind creature for whose love he had made so selfish a return <\s>
<s> old john was in waiting to receive his master's baggage but he appeared in a fustian jacket and no longer wore his livery of drab and blue <\s>
<s> i'se garner and stable man and lives in the ladge now this worthy man remarked with a grin of welcome to pen and something of a blush but instantly as pen turned the corner of the shrubbery and was out of eye shot of the coach helen made her appearance her face beaming with love and forgiveness for forgiving is what some women love best of all <\s>
<s> we may be sure that the widow having a certain other object in view had lost no time in writing off to pen an account of the noble the magnanimous the magnificent offer of laura filling up her letter with a profusion of benedictions upon both her children <\s>
<s> it was probably the knowledge of this money obligation which caused pen to blush very much when he saw laura who was in waiting in the hall and who this time and for this time only broke through the little arrangement of which we have spoken as having subsisted between her and arthur for the last few years but the truth is there has been a great deal too much said about kissing in the present chapter <\s>
<s> so the prodigal came home and the fatted calf was killed for him and he was made as happy as two simple women could make him <\s>
<s> no allusions were made to the oxbridge mishap or questions asked as to his farther proceedings for some time <\s>
<s> but pen debated these anxiously in his own mind and up in his own room where he passed much time in cogitation <\s>
<s> a few days after he came home he rode to chatteris on his horse and came back on the top of the coach <\s>
<s> he then informed his mother that he had left the horse to be sold and when that operation was effected he handed her over the cheque which she and possibly pen himself thought was an act of uncommon virtue and self denial but which laura pronounced to be only strict justice <\s>
<s> he rarely mentioned the loan which she had made and which indeed had been accepted by the widow with certain modifications but once or twice and with great hesitation and stammering he alluded to it and thanked her but it evidently pained his vanity to be beholden to the orphan for succour <\s>
<s> he was wild to find some means of repaying her <\s>
<s> he left off drinking wine and betook himself but with great moderation to the refreshment of whisky and water <\s>
<s> he gave up cigar smoking but it must be confessed that of late years he had liked pipes and tobacco as well or even better so that this sacrifice was not a very severe one <\s>
<s> he fell asleep a great deal after dinner when he joined the ladies in the drawing room and was certainly very moody and melancholy <\s>
<s> he watched the coaches with great interest walked in to read the papers at clavering assiduously dined with anybody who would ask him and the widow was glad that he should have any entertainment in their solitary place and played a good deal at cribbage with captain glanders <\s>
<s> portman who in his turn whenever pen passed gave him very severe looks from under his shovel hat <\s>
<s> he went to church with his mother however very regularly and read prayers for her at home to the little household <\s>
<s> always humble it was greatly diminished now a couple of maids did the work of the house of fairoaks the silver dish covers never saw the light at all <\s>
<s> john put on his livery to go to church and assert his dignity on sundays but it was only for form's sake <\s>
<s> he was gardener and out door man vice upton resigned <\s>
<s> there was but little fire in fairoaks kitchen and john and the maids drank their evening beer there by the light of a single candle <\s>
<s> all this was mr <\s>
<s> pen's doing and the state of things did not increas his cheerfulness <\s>
<s> for some time pen said no power on earth could induce him to go back to oxbridge again after his failure there but one day laura said to him with many blushes that she thought as some sort of reparation of punishment on himself for his for his idleness he ought to go back and get his degree if he could fetch it by doing so and so back mr <\s>
<s> a plucked man is a dismal being in a university belonging to no set of men there and owned by no one <\s>
<s> pen felt himself plucked indeed of all the fine feathers which he had won during his brilliant years and rarely appeared out of his college regularly going to morning chapel and shutting himself up in his rooms of nights away from the noise and suppers of the undergraduates <\s>
<s> there were no duns about his door they were all paid scarcely any cards were left there <\s>
<s> the men of his year had taken their degrees and were gone <\s>
<s> he went into a second examination and passed with perfect ease <\s>
<s> he was somewhat more easy in his mind when he appeared in his bachelor's gown <\s>
<s> on his way back from oxbridge he paid a visit to his uncle in london but the old gentleman received him with very cold looks and would scarcely give him his forefinger to shake <\s>
<s> he called a second time but morgan the valet said his master was from home <\s>
<s> pen came back to fairoaks and to his books and to his idleness and loneliness and despair <\s>
<s> he commenced several tragedies and wrote many copies of verses of a gloomy cast <\s>
<s> he formed plans of reading and broke them <\s>
<s> he thought about enlisting about the spanish legion about a profession <\s>
<s> he chafed against his captivity and cursed the idleness which had caused it <\s>
<s> helen said he was breaking his heart and was sad to see his prostration <\s>
<s> as soon as they could afford it he should go abroad he should go to london he should be freed from the dull society of two poor women <\s>
<s> it was dull very certainly <\s>
<s> the tender widow's habitual melancholy seemed to deepen into a sadder gloom and laura saw with alarm that the dear friend became every year more languid and weary and that her pale cheek grew more wan <\s>
<s> new faces the inmates of fairoaks were drowsily pursuing this humdrum existence while the great house upon the hill on the other side of the river brawl was shaking off the slumber in which it had lain during the lives of two generations of masters and giving extraordinary signs of renewed liveliness <\s>
<s> just about the time of pen's little mishap and when he was so absorbed in the grief occasioned by that calamity as to take no notice of events which befell persons less interesting to himself than arthur pendennis an announcement appeared in the provincial journals which caused no small sensation in the county at least and in all the towns villages halls and mansions and parsonages for many miles round clavering park <\s>
<s> at clavering market at cackleby fair at chatteris sessions on gooseberry green as the squire's carriage met the vicar's one horse contrivance and the inmates of both vehicles stopped on the road to talk at tinkleton church gate as the bell was tolling in the sunshine and the white smocks and scarlet cloaks came trooping over the green common to sunday worship in a hundred societies round about the word was that clavering park was to be inhabited again <\s>
<s> some five years before the county papers had advertised the marriage at florence at the british legation of francis clavering esq only son of sir francis clavering bart of clavering park with jemima augusta daughter of samuel snell of calcutta esq and widow of the late j <\s>

<s> clavering occupied the poggi palace at florence gave parties and lived comfortably but could never come to england <\s>
<s> another year young peregrine of cackleby making a long vacation tour had fallen in with the claverings occupying schloss schinkenstein on the mummel see <\s>
<s> at rome at lucca at nice at the baths and gambling places of the rhine and belgium this worthy couple might occasionally be heard of by the curious and rumours of them came as it were by gusts to clavering's ancestral place <\s>
<s> their last place of abode was paris where they appear to have lived in great fashion and splendour after the news of the death of samuel snell esq of calcutta reached his orphan daughter in europe <\s>
<s> of sir francis clavering's antecedents little can be said that would be advantageous to that respected baronet <\s>
<s> the son of an outlaw living in a dismal old chateau near bruges this gentleman had made a feeble attempt to start in life with a commission in a dragoon regiment and had broken down almost at the outset <\s>
<s> transactions at the gambling table had speedily effected his ruin after a couple of years in the army he had been forced to sell out had passed some time in her majesty's prison of the fleet and had then shipped over to ostend to join the gouty exile his father <\s>
<s> and in belgium france and germany for some years this decayed and abortive prodigal might be seen lurking about billiard rooms and watering places punting at gambling houses dancing at boarding house balls and riding steeple chases on other folks horses <\s>
<s> it was at a boarding house at lausanne that francis clavering made what he called the lucky coup of marrying the widow amory very lately returned from calcutta <\s>
<s> his father died soon after by consequence of whose demise his wife became lady clavering <\s>
<s> the title so delighted mr <\s>
<s> snell of calcutta that he doubled his daughter's allowance and dying himself soon after left a fortune to her and her children the amount of which was if not magnified by rumour something very splendid indeed <\s>
<s> before this time there had been not rumours unfavourable to lady clavering's reputation but unpleasant impressions regarding her ladyship <\s>
<s> the best english people abroad were shy of making her acquaintance her manners were not the most refined her origin was lamentably low and doubtful <\s>
<s> the retired east indians who are to be found in considerable force in most of the continental towns frequented by english spoke with much scorn of the disreputable old lawyer and indigo smuggler her father and of amory her first husband who had been mate of the indiaman in which miss snell came out to join her father at calcutta <\s>
<s> neither father nor daughter were in society at calcutta or had ever been heard of at government house <\s>
<s> old sir jasper rogers who had been chief justice of calcutta had once said to his wife that he could tell a queer story about lady clavering's first husband but greatly to lady rogers's disappointment and that of the young ladies his daughters the old judge could never be got to reveal that mystery <\s>
