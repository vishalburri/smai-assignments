<s> when his fond mamma beheld her boy that morning she remarked on the pallor of his cheek and the general gloom of his aspect <\s>
<s> why do you go on playing billiards at that wicked spratt's <\s>
<s> my dearest child those billiards will kill you i'm sure they will <\s>
<s> it isn't the billiards harry said gloomily <\s>
<s> then it's the dreadful back kitchen said the lady agnes <\s>
<s> i've often thought d'you know harry of writing to the landlady and begging that she would have the kindness to put only very little wine in the negus which you take and see that you have your shawl on before you get into your brougham <\s>
<s> mrs cutts is a most kind motley woman harry said <\s>
<s> but it isn't the back kitchen neither he added with a ghastly sigh <\s>
<s> as lady agnes never denied her son anything and fell into all his ways with the fondest acquiescence she was rewarded by a perfect confidence on young harry's part who never thought to disguise from her a knowledge of the haunts which he frequented and on the contrary brought her home choice anecdotes from the clubs and billiard rooms which the simple lady relished if she did not understand <\s>
<s> my son goes to spratt's she would say to her confidential friends <\s>
<s> all the young men go to spratt's after their balls <\s>
<s> it is de rigueur my dear and they play billiards as they used to play macao and hazard in mr <\s>
<s> yes my dear father often told me that they sate up always until nine o'clock the next morning with mr <\s>
<s> fox at brookes's whom i remember at drnmmington when i was a little girl in a buff waistcoat and black satin small clothes <\s>
<s> my brother erith never played as a young man nor sate up late he had no health for it but my boy must do as everybody does you know <\s>
<s> yes and then he often goes to a place called the back kitchen frequented by all the wits and authors you know whom one does not see in society but whom it is a great privilege and pleasure for harry to meet and there he hears the questions of the day discussed and my dear father often said that it was our duty to encourage literature and he had hoped to see the late dr <\s>
<s> johnson at drummington only dr <\s>
<s> sheridan came over and drank a great deal of wine everybody drank a great deal of wine in those days and papa's wine merchant's bill was ten times as much as erith's is who gets it as he wants it from fortnum and mason's and doesn't keep any stock at all <\s>
<s> that was an uncommon good dinner we had yesterday ma'am the artful harry broke out <\s>
<s> their clear soup's better than ours <\s>
<s> moufflet will put too much taragon into everything <\s>
<s> the supreme de volaille was very good uncommon and the sweets were better than moufflet's sweets <\s>
<s> did you taste the plombiere ma'am and the maraschino jelly <\s>
<s> stunningly good that maraschino jelly <\s>
<s> lady agnes expressed her agreement in these as in almost all other sentiments of her son who continued the artful conversation saying very handsome house that of the claverings <\s>
<s> furniture i should say got up regardless of expense <\s>
<s> magnificent display of plate ma'am <\s>
<s> the lady assented to all these propositions <\s>
<s> very nice people the claverings <\s>
<s> i know what you mean <\s>
<s> ain't distangy exactly but she is very good natured <\s>
<s> oh very mamma said who was herself one of the most good natured of women <\s>
<s> and sir francis he don't talk much before ladies but after dinner he comes out uncommon strong ma'am a highly agreeable well informed man <\s>
<s> when will you ask them to dinner <\s>
<s> look out for an early day ma'am and looking into lady agnes's pocket book he chose a day only a fortnight hence an age that fortnight seemed to the young gentleman when the claverings were to be invited to grosvenor street <\s>
<s> the obedient lady agnes wrote the required invitation <\s>
<s> she was accustomed to do so without consulting her husband who had his own society and habits and who left his wife to see her own friends alone <\s>
<s> harry looked at the card but there was an omission in the invitation which did not please him <\s>
<s> you have not asked miss whatdyecallem miss emery lady clavering's daughter <\s>
<s> oh that little creature <\s>
<s> i think not harry <\s>
<s> we must ask miss amory foker said <\s>
<s> i i want to ask pendennis and and he's very sweet upon her <\s>
<s> don't you think she sings very well ma'am <\s>
<s> i thought her rather forward and didn't listen to her singing <\s>
<s> she only sang at you and mr <\s>
<s> pendennis it seemed to me <\s>
<s> but i will ask her if you wish harry and so miss amory's name was written on the card with her mother's <\s>
<s> this piece of diplomacy being triumphantly executed harry embraced his fond parent with the utmost affection and retired to his own apartments where he stretched himself on his ottoman and lay brooding silently sighing for the day which was to bring the fair miss amory under his paternal roof and devising a hundred wild schemes for meeting her <\s>
<s> on his return from making the grand tour mr <\s>
<s> foker junior had brought with him a polyglot valet who took the place of stoopid and condescended to wait at dinner attired in shirt fronts of worked muslin with many gold studs and chains upon his master and the elders of the family <\s>
<s> this man who was of no particular country and spoke all languages indifferently ill made himself useful to mr <\s>
<s> harry in a variety of ways read all the artless youth's correspondence knew his favourite haunts and the addresses of his acquaintance and officiated at the private dinners which the young gentleman gave <\s>
<s> as harry lay upon his sofa after his interview with his mamma robed in a wonderful dressing gown and puffing his pipe in gloomy silence anatole too must have remarked that something affected his master's spirits though he did not betray any ill bred sympathy with harry's agitation of mind <\s>
<s> when harry began to dress himself in his out of door morning costume he was very hard indeed to please and particularly severe and snappish about his toilet he tried and cursed pantaloons of many different stripes checks and colours all the boots were villainously varnished the shirts too loud in pattern <\s>
<s> he scented his linen and person with peculiar richness this day and what must have been the valet's astonishment when after some blushing and hesitation on harry's part the young gentleman asked i say anatole when i engaged you didn't you hem didn't you say that you could dress hem dress hair <\s>
<s> the valet said yes he could <\s>
<s> cherchy alors une paire de tongs et curly moi un peu mr <\s>
<s> foker said in an easy manner and the valet wondering whether his master was in love or was going masquerading went in search of the articles first from the old butler who waited upon mr <\s>
<s> foker senior on whose bald pate the tongs would have scarcely found a hundred hairs to seize and finally of the lady who had the charge of the meek auburn fronts of the lady agnes <\s>
<s> and the tongs being got monsieur anatole twisted his young master's locks until he had made harry's head as curly as a negro's after which the youth dressed himself with the utmost care and splendour and proceeded to sally out <\s>
<s> at what dime sall i order de drag sir to be to miss calverley's door sir <\s>
<s> the attendant whispered as his master was going forth <\s>
<s> confound her put the dinner off i can't go <\s>
<s> no hang it i must go <\s>
<s> poyntz and rougemont and ever so many more are coming <\s>
<s> the drag at pelham corner at six o'clock anatole <\s>
<s> the drag was not one of mr <\s>
<s> foker's own equipages but was hired from a livery stable for festive purposes foker however put his own carriage into requisition that morning and for what purpose does the kind reader suppose <\s>
<s> why to drive down to lamb court temple taking grosvenor place by the way which lies in the exact direction of the temple from grosvenor street as everybody knows where he just had the pleasure of peeping upwards at miss amory's pink window curtains having achieved which satisfactory feat he drove off to pen's chambers <\s>
<s> why did he want to see his dear friend pen so much <\s>
<s> why did he yearn and long after him and did it seem necessary to foker's very existence that he should see pen that morning having parted with him in perfect health on the night previous <\s>
