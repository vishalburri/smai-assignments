<s> but pen on his part had no such scruples <\s>
<s> miss fanny bolton did not make his bed nor sweep his chambers and he did not choose to let go his pretty little partner <\s>
<s> as for fanny her colour heightened and her bright eyes shone the brighter with pleasure as she leaned for protection on the arm of such a fine gentleman as mr <\s>
<s> and she looked at numbers of other ladies in the place and at scores of other gentlemen under whose protection they were walking here and there and she thought that her gentleman was handsomer and grander looking than any other gent in the place <\s>
<s> of course there were votaries of pleasure of all ranks there rakish young surgeons fast young clerks and commercialists occasional dandies of the guard regiments and the rest <\s>
<s> old lord colchicum was there in attendance upon mademoiselle caracoline who had been riding in the ring and who talked her native french very loud and used idiomatic expressions of exceeding strength as she walked about leaning on the arm of his lordship <\s>
<s> colchicum was in attendance upon mademoiselle carandine little tom tufthunt was in attendance upon lord colchicum and rather pleased too with his position <\s>
<s> when don juan scalles the wall there's never a want of a leporello to hold the ladder <\s>
<s> tom tufthunt was quite happy to act as friend to the elderly viscount and to carve the fowl and to make the salad at supper <\s>
<s> when pen and his young lady met the viscount's party that noble poor only gave arthur a passing leer of recognition as his lordship's eyes passed from pen's face under the bonnet of pen's companion <\s>
<s> but tom tufthunt wagged his head very good naturedly at mr <\s>
<s> arthur and said how are you old boy <\s>
<s> and looked extremely knowing at the godfather of this history <\s>
<s> that is the great rider at astley's i have seen her there miss bolton said looking after mademoiselle caracoline and who is that old man <\s>
<s> is it not the gentleman in the ring <\s>
<s> that is lord viscount colchicum miss fanny said pen with an air of protection <\s>
<s> he meant no harm he was pleased to patronise the young girl and he was not displeased that she should be so pretty and that she should be hanging upon his arm and that yonder elderly don juan should have seen her there <\s>
<s> fanny was very pretty her eyes were dark and brilliant her teeth were like little pearls her mouth was almost as red as mademoiselle caracoline's when the latter had put on her vermilion <\s>
<s> and what a difference there was between the one's voice and the other's between the girl's laugh and the woman's <\s>
<s> it was only very lately indeed that fanny when looking in the little glass over the bows costigan mantelpiece as she was dusting it had begun to suspect that she was a beauty <\s>
<s> but a year ago she was a clumsy gawky girl at whom her father sneered and of whom the girls at the day school miss minifer's newcastle street strand miss m the younger sister took the leading business at the norwich circuit in 182 and she herself had played for two seasons with some credit t <\s>
<s> w until she fell down a trap door and broke her leg ); the girls at fanny's school we say took no account of her and thought her a dowdy little creature as long as she remained under miss minifer's instruction <\s>
<s> and it was unremarked and almost unseen in the porter's dark lodge of shepherd's inn that this little flower bloomed into beauty <\s>
<s> so this young person hung upon mr <\s>
<s> pen's arm and they paced the gardens together empty as london was there were still some two millions of people left lingering about it and amongst them one or two of the acquaintances of mr <\s>
<s> amongst them silent and alone pale with his hands in his pockets and a rueful nod of the head to arthur as they met passed henry foker esq <\s>
<s> young henry was trying to ease his mind by moving from place to place and from excitement to excitement <\s>
<s> but he thought about blanche as he sauntered in the dark walks he thought about blanche as he looked at the devices of the lamps <\s>
<s> he consulted the fortune teller about her and was disappointed when that gipsy told him that he was in love with a dark lady who would make him happy and at the concert though mr <\s>
<s> momus sang his most stunning comic songs and asked his most astonishing riddles never did a kind smile come to visit foker's lips <\s>
<s> in fact he never heard mr <\s>
<s> pen and miss bolton were hard by listening to the same concert and the latter remarked and pen laughed at mr <\s>
<s> fanny asked what it was that made that odd looking little man so dismal <\s>
<s> i think he is crossed in love <\s>
<s> isn't that enough to make any man dismal fanny <\s>
<s> and he looked down at her splendidly protecting her like egmont at clara in goethe's play or leicester at amy in scott's novel <\s>
<s> crossed in love is he <\s>
<s> poor gentleman said fanny with a sigh and her eyes turned round towards him with no little kindness and pity but harry did not see the beautiful dark eyes <\s>
<s> how dy do mr <\s>
<s> pendennis a voice broke in here it was that of a young man in a large white coat with a red neckcloth over which a dingy shirt collar was turned so as to exhibit a dubious neck with a large pin of bullion or other metal and an imaginative waistcoat with exceedingly fanciful glass buttons and trousers that cried with a loud voice come look at me and see how cheap and tawdry i am my master what a dirty buck <\s>
<s> and a little stick in one pocket of his coat and a lady in pink satin on the other arm how dy do forget me i dare say <\s>
<s> how do you do mr <\s>
<s> huxter the prince of fairoaks said in his most princely manner i hope you are very well <\s>
<s> pretty bobbish thanky and mr <\s>
<s> huxter wagged his head <\s>
<s> i say pendennis you've been coming it uncommon strong since we had the row at wapshot's don't you remember <\s>
<s> go about with the swells <\s>
<s> saw your name in the morning post <\s>
<s> i suppose you're too much of a swell to come and have a bit of supper with an old friend charterhouse lane to morrow night some devilish good fellows from bartholomew's and some stunning gin punch <\s>
<s> and with this mr <\s>
<s> huxter released his hand from the pocket where his cane was and pulling off the top of his card case with his teeth produced thence a visiting ticket which he handed to pen <\s>
<s> you are exceedingly kind i am sure said pen but i regret that i have an engagement which will take me out of town to morrow night <\s>
<s> and the marquis of fairoaks wondering that such a creature as this could have the audacity to give him a card put mr <\s>
<s> huxter's card into his waistcoat pocket with a lofty courtesy <\s>
<s> samuel huxter was not aware that there was any great social difference between mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis and himself <\s>
<s> huxter's father was a surgeon and apothecary at clavering just as mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's papa had been a surgeon and apothecary at bath <\s>
<s> but the impudence of some men is beyond all calculation <\s>
<s> well old fellow never mind said mr <\s>
<s> huxter who always frank and familiar was from vinous excitement even more affable than usual <\s>
<s> if ever you are passing look up our place i'm mostly at home saturdays and there's generally a cheese cupboard <\s>
<s> ta ta there's the bell for the fireworks ringing <\s>
