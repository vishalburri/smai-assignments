<s> at the end of the mutual inspection altamont began to button up his brass buttoned coat and rising up from his chair suddenly and to the company's astonishment reeled towards the door and issued from it followed by strong all that the latter heard him utter was captain beak <\s>
<s> captain beak by jingo <\s>
<s> there had not passed above a quarter of an hour from his strange appearance to his equally sudden departure <\s>
<s> the two young men and the baronet's other guest wondered at the scene and could find no explanation for it <\s>
<s> clavering seemed exceedingly pale and agitated and turned with looks of almost terror towards major pendennis <\s>
<s> the latter had been eyeing his host keenly for a moment or two <\s>
<s> i never heard a voice i liked so well as yours i think <\s>
<s> i thought you liked laura's said miss blanche <\s>
<s> laura's is a contralto and that voice is very often out you know pen said bitterly <\s>
<s> i have heard a great deal of music in london he continued <\s>
<s> i'm tired of those professional people they sing too loud or i have grown too old or too blase <\s>
<s> one grows old very soon in london miss amory <\s>
<s> and like all old fellows i only care for the songs i heard in my youth <\s>
<s> i like english music best <\s>
<s> i don't care for foreign songs much <\s>
<s> get me some saddle of mutton said mr <\s>
<s> i adore english ballads of all things said miss amory <\s>
<s> sing me one of the old songs after dinner will you <\s>
<s> said pen with an imploring voice <\s>
<s> shall i sing you an english song after dinner <\s>
<s> asked the sylphide turning to mr <\s>
<s> i will if you will promise to come up soon and she gave him a perfect broadside of her eyes <\s>
<s> i'll come up after dinner fast enough he said simply <\s>
<s> i don't care about much wine afterwards i take my whack at dinner i mean my share you know and when i have had as much as i want i toddle up to tea <\s>
<s> i'm a domestic character miss amory my habits are simple and when i'm pleased i'm generally in a good humour ain't i pen that jelly if you please not that one the other with the cherries inside <\s>
<s> how the doose do they get those cherries inside the jellies <\s>
<s> in this way the artless youth prattled on and miss amory listened to him with inexhaustible good humour <\s>
<s> when the ladies took their departure for the upper regions blanche made the two young men promise faithfully to quit the table soon and departed with kind glances to each <\s>
<s> she dropped her gloves on foker's side of the table and her handkerchief on pen's <\s>
<s> each had had some little attention paid to him her politeness to mr <\s>
<s> foker was perhaps a little more encouraging than her kindness to arthur but the benevolent little creature did her best to make both the gentlemen happy <\s>
<s> foker caught her last glance as she rushed out of the door that bright look passed over mr <\s>
<s> strong's broad white waistcoat and shot straight at harry foker's <\s>
<s> the door closed on the charmer he sate down with a sigh and swallowed a bumper of claret <\s>
<s> as the dinner at which pen and his uncle took their places was not one of our grand parties it had been served at a considerably earlier hour than those ceremonial banquets of the london season which custom has ordained shall scarcely take place before nine o'clock and the company being small and miss blanche anxious to betake herself to her piano in the drawing room giving constant hints to her mother to retreat lady clavering made that signal very speedily so that it was quite daylight yet when the ladies reached the upper apartments from the flower embroidered balconies of which they could command a view of the two parks of the poor couples and children still sauntering in the one and of the equipages of ladies and the horses of dandies passing through the arch of the other <\s>
<s> the sun in a word had not set behind the elms of kensington gardens and was still gilding the statue erected by the ladies of england in honour of his grace the duke of wellington when lady clavering and her female friends left the gentlemen drinking wine <\s>
<s> the windows of the dining room were opened to let in the fresh air and afforded to the passers by in the street a pleasant or perhaps tantalising view of six gentlemen in white waistcoats with a quantity of decanters and a variety of fruits before them little boys as they passed and jumped up at the area railings and took a peep said to one another hi hi jim shouldn't you like to be there and have a cut of that there pineapple the horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to belgravian toilets the policeman with clamping feet patrolled up and down before the mansion the shades of evening began to fall the gasman came and lighted the lamps before sir francis's door the butler entered the dining room and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak dining table so that from outside the house you looked inwards upon a night scene of feasting and wax candles and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening and the wall of saint james's park and the sky above in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle <\s>
<s> jeames with folded legs leaning against the door pillar of his master's abode looked forth musingly upon the latter tranquil sight whilst a spectator clinging to the railings examined the former scene <\s>
<s> policeman x passing gave his attention to neither but fixed it upon the individual holding by the railings and gazing into sir francis clavering's dining room where strong was laughing and talking away making the conversation for the party <\s>
<s> the man at the railing was very gorgeously attired with chains jewellery and waistcoats which the illumination from the house lighted up to great advantage his boots were shiny he had brass buttons to his coat and large white wristbands over his knuckles and indeed looked so grand that x imagined he beheld a member of parliament or a person of consideration before him <\s>
<s> whatever his rank however the m p or person of consideration was considerably excited by wine for he lurched and reeled somewhat in his gait and his hat was cocked over his wild and bloodshot eyes in a manner which no sober hat ever could assume <\s>
<s> his copious black hair was evidently surreptitious and his whiskers of the tyrian purple <\s>
<s> as strong's laughter following after one of his own gros mots came ringing out of window this gentleman without laughed and sniggered in the queerest way likewise and he slapped his thigh and winked at jeames pensive in the portico as much as to say plush my boy isn't that a good story <\s>
<s> jeames's attention had been gradually drawn from the moon in the heavens to this sublunary scene and he was puzzled and alarmed by the appearance of the man in shiny boots <\s>
<s> a holtercation he remarked afterwards in the servants' hall a holtercation with a feller in the streets is never no good and indeed he was not hired for any such purpose <\s>
<s> so having surveyed the man for some time who went on laughing reeling nodding his head with tipsy knowingness jeames looked out of the portico and softly called pleaceman and beckoned to that officer <\s>
<s> x marched up resolute with one berlin glove stuck in his belt side and jeames simply pointed with his index finger to the individual who was laughing against the railings <\s>
<s> not one single word more than pleaceman did he say but stood there in the calm summer evening pointing calmly a grand sight <\s>
<s> x advanced to the individual and said now sir will you have the kindness to move hon <\s>
<s> the individual who was in perfect good humour did not appear to bear one word which policeman x uttered but nodded and waggled his grinning head at strong until his hat almost fell from his head over the area railings <\s>
<s> now sir move on do you hear <\s>
<s> cries x in a much more peremptory tone and he touched the stranger gently with one of the fingers enclosed in the gauntlets of the berlin woof <\s>
<s> he of the many rings instantly started or rather staggered back into what is called an attitude of self defence and in that position began the operation which is entitled squaring at policeman x and showed himself brave and warlike if unsteady <\s>
<s> keep your hands off a gentleman he said with an oath which need not be repeated <\s>
<s> move on out of this said x and don't be a blocking up the pavement staring into gentlemen's dining rooms <\s>
<s> not stare ho ho not stare that is a good one replied the other with a satiric laugh and sneer who's to prevent me from staring looking at my friends if i like <\s>
<s> not you old highlows <\s>
<s> move on answered x <\s>
<s> if you touch me i'll pitch into you i will roared the other <\s>
<s> i tell you i know em all that's sir francis clavering baronet m p i know him and he knows me and that's strong and that's the young chap that made the row at the ball <\s>
<s> i say strong strong <\s>
<s> it's that d altamont cried sir francis within with a start and a guilty look and strong also with a look of annoyance got up from the table and ran out to the intruder <\s>
<s> a gentleman in a white waistcoat running out from a dining room bareheaded a policeman and an individual decently attired engaged in almost fisticuffs on the pavement were enough to make a crowd even in that quiet neighbourhood at half past eight o'clock in the evening and a small mob began to assemble before sir francis clavering's door <\s>
<s> for god's sake come in strong said seizing his acquaintance's arm <\s>
<s> send for a cab james if you please he added in an under voice to that domestic and carrying the excited gentleman out of the street the outer door was closed upon him and the small crowd began to move away <\s>
<s> strong had intended to convey the stranger into sir francis's private sitting room where the hats of the male guests were awaiting them and having there soothed his friend by bland conversation to have carried him off as soon as the cab arrived but the new comer was in a great state of wrath at the indignity which had been put upon him and when strong would have led him into the second door said in a tipsy voice that ain't the door that's the dining room door where the drink's going on and i'll go and have some by jove i'll go and have some <\s>
<s> at this audacity the butler stood aghast in the hall and placed himself before the door but it opened behind him and the master of the house made his appearance with anxious looks <\s>
<s> i will have some by i will the intruder was roaring out as sir francis came forward <\s>
<s> clavering i say i'm come to have some wine with you hay <\s>
<s> old boy hay old corkscrew <\s>
<s> get us a bottle of the yellow seal you old thief the very best a hundred rupees a dozen and no mistake <\s>
<s> the host reflected a moment over his company <\s>
<s> there is only welbore pendennis and those two lads he thought and with a forced laugh and a piteous look he said well altamont come in <\s>
<s> i am very glad to see you i'm sure <\s>
<s> colonel altamont for the intelligent reader has doubtless long ere this discovered in the stranger his excellency the ambassador of the nawaub of lucknow reeled into the dining room with a triumphant look towards jeames the footman which seemed to say there sir what do you think of that <\s>
<s> now am i a gentleman or no <\s>
<s> and sank down into the first vacant chair <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering timidly stammered out the colonel's name to his guest mr <\s>
<s> welbore welbore and his excellency began drinking wine forthwith and gazing round upon the company now with the most wonderful frowns and anon with the blandest smiles and hiccupped remarks encomiastic of the drink which he was imbibing <\s>
<s> has resided long in a native court in india strong said with great gravity the chevalier's presence of mind never deserting him in those indian courts they get very singular habits <\s>
<s> very said major pendennis drily and wondering what in goodness name was the company into which he had got <\s>
<s> foker was pleased with the new comer <\s>
<s> it's the man who would sing the malay song at the back kitchen he whispered to pen <\s>
<s> try this pine sir he then said to colonel altamont it's uncommonly fine <\s>
<s> pines i've seen em feed pigs on pines said the colonel <\s>
<s> all the nawaub of lucknow's pigs are fed on pines strong whispered to major pendennis <\s>
<s> oh of course the major answered <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering was in the meanwhile endeavouring to make an excuse to his brother guest for the new comer's condition and muttered something regarding altamont that he was an extraordinary character very eccentric very had indian habits didn't understand the rules of english society to which old welbore a shrewd old gentleman who drank his wine with great regularity said that seemed pretty clear <\s>
<s> then the colonel seeing pen's honest face regarded it for a while with as much steadiness as became his condition and said i know you too young fellow <\s>
<s> baymouth ball by jingo <\s>
<s> wanted to fight the frenchman <\s>
<s> i remember you and he laughed and he squared with his fists and seemed hugely amused in the drunken depths of his mind as these recollections passed or rather reeled across it <\s>
<s> pendennis you remember colonel altamont at baymouth <\s>
<s> strong said upon which pen bowing rather stiffly said he had the pleasure of remembering that circumstance perfectly <\s>
<s> pendennis pendennis be hanged <\s>
<s> altamont roared out to the surprise of every one and thumping with his fist on the table <\s>
<s> my name is also pendennis sir said the major whose dignity was exceedingly mortified by the evening's events that he major pendennis should have been asked to such a party and that a drunken man should have been introduced to it <\s>
<s> my name is pendennis and i will be obliged to you not to curse it too loudly <\s>
<s> the tipsy man turned round to look at him and as he looked it appeared as if colonel altamont suddenly grew sober <\s>
<s> he put his hand across his forehead and in doing so displaced somewhat the black wig which he wore and his eyes stared fiercely at the major who in his turn like a resolute old warrior as he was looked at his opponent very keenly and steadily <\s>
