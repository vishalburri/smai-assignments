<s> he said the wine at the polyanthus was not so good as ellis's wine at richmond smoked warrington's cavendish after breakfast and when i gave him a sovereign as a farewell token said he had plenty of them but would take it to show he wasn't proud <\s>
<s> did he did you ask young clavering <\s>
<s> cried the major appeased at once fine boy rather wild but a fine boy parents like that sort of attention and you can't do better than pay it to our worthy friends of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> and so you took him to the play and tipped him <\s>
<s> that was right sir that was right with which mentor quitted telemachus thinking that the young men were not so very bad and that he should make something of that fellow yet <\s>
<s> as blaster clavering grew into years and stature he became too strong for the authority of his fond parents and governess and rather governed them than permitted himself to be led by their orders <\s>
<s> with his papa he was silent and sulky seldom making his appearance however in the neighbourhood of that gentleman with his mamma be roared and fought when any contest between them arose as to the gratification of his appetite or other wish of his heart and in his disputes with his governess over his book he kicked that quiet creature's shins so fiercely that she was entirely overmastered and subdued by him <\s>
<s> and he would have so treated his sister blanche too and did on one or two occasions attempt to prevail over her but she showed an immense resolution and spirit on her part and boxed his ears so soundly that he forbore from molesting miss amory as he did the governess and his mamma and his mamma's maid <\s>
<s> at length when the family came to london sir francis gave forth his opinion that the little beggar had best be sent to school <\s>
<s> accordingly the young son and heir of the house of clavering was despatched to the rev <\s>
<s> otto rose's establishment at twickenham where young noblemen and gentlemen were received preparatory to their introduction to the great english public schools <\s>
<s> it is not our intention to follow master clavering in his scholastic career the paths to the temple of learning were made more easy to him than they were to some of us of earlier generations <\s>
<s> he advanced towards that fane in a carriage and four so to speak and might halt and take refreshment almost whenever he pleased <\s>
<s> he wore varnished boots from the earliest period of youth and had cambric handkerchiefs and lemon coloured kid gloves of the smallest size ever manufactured by privat <\s>
<s> they dressed regularly at mr <\s>
<s> rose's to come down to dinner the young gentlemen had shawl dressing gowns fires in their bedrooms horse and carriage exercise occasionally and oil for their hair <\s>
<s> corporal punishment was altogether dispensed with by the principal who thought that moral discipline was entirely sufficient to lead youth and the boys were so rapidly advanced in many branches of learning that they acquired the art of drinking spirits and smoking cigars even before they were old enough to enter a public school <\s>
<s> young frank clavering stole his father's havannahs and conveyed them to school or smoked them in the stables at a surprisingly early period of life and at ten years old drank his champagne almost as stoutly as any whiskered cornet of dragoons could do <\s>
<s> when this interesting youth came home for his vacations major pendennis was as laboriously civil and gracious to him as he was to the rest of the family although the boy had rather a contempt for old wigsby as the major was denominated mimicked him behind his back as the polite major bowed and smirked with lady clavering or miss amory and drew rude caricatures such as are designed by ingenious youths in which the major's wig his nose his tie etc were represented with artless exaggeration <\s>
<s> untiring in his efforts to be agreeable the major wished that pen too should take particular notice of this child incited arthur to invite him to his chambers to give him a dinner at the club to take him to madame tussaud's the tower the play and so forth and to tip him as the phrase is at the end of the day's pleastres <\s>
<s> arthur who was good natured and fond of children went through all these ceremonies one day had the boy to breakfast at the temple where he made the most contemptuous remarks regarding the furniture the crockery and the tattered state of warrington's dressing gown and smoked a short pipe and recounted the history of a fight between tuffy and long biggings at rose's greatly to the edification of the two gentlemen his hosts <\s>
<s> as the major rightly predicted lady clavering was very grateful for arthur's attention to the boy more grateful than the lad himself who took attentions as a matter of course and very likely had more sovereigns in his pocket than poor pen who generously gave him one of his own slender stock of those coins <\s>
<s> the major with the sharp eyes with which nature endowed him and with the glasses of age and experience watched this boy and surveyed his position in the family without seeming to be rudely curious about their affairs <\s>
<s> but as a country neighbour one who had many family obligations to the claverings an old man of the world he took occasion to find out what lady clavering's means were how her capital was disposed and what the boy was to inherit <\s>
