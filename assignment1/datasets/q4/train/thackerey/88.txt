<s> one young man of fashion we have mentioned who at least it might have been expected would have been found faithful amongst the faithless and harry foker esq was indeed that young man <\s>
<s> but he had not managed matters with prudence and the unhappy passion at first confided to pen became notorious and ridiculous to the town was carried to the ears of his weak and fond mother and finally brought under the cognisance of the bald headed and inflexible foker senior <\s>
<s> foker learned this disagreeable news there took place between him and his son a violent and painful scene which ended in the poor little gentleman's banishment from england for a year with a positive order to return at the expiration of that time and complete his marriage with his cousin or to retire into private life and three hundred a year altogether and never see parent or brewery more <\s>
<s> henry foker went away then carrying with him that grief and care which passes free at the strictest custom houses and which proverbially accompanies the exile and with this crape over his eyes even the parisian boulevard looked melancholy to him and the sky of italy black <\s>
<s> to sir francis clavering that year was a most unfortunate one <\s>
<s> the events described in the last chapter came to complete the ruin of the year <\s>
<s> it was that year of grace in which as our sporting readers may remember lord harrowhill's horse he was a classical young nobleman and named his stud out of the iliad when podasokus won the derby to the dismay of the knowing ones who pronounced the winning horse's name in various extraordinary ways and who backed borax who was nowhere in the race <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering who was intimate with some of the most rascally characters of the turf and of course had valuable information had laid heavy odds against the winning horse and backed the favourite freely and the result of his dealings was as his son correctly stated to poor lady clavering a loss of seven thousand pounds <\s>
<s> indeed it was a cruel blow upon the lady who had discharged her husband's debts many times over who had received as many times his oaths and promises of amendment who had paid his money lenders and horse dealers who had furnished his town and country houses and who was called upon now instantly to meet this enormous sum the penalty of her cowardly husband's extravagance <\s>
<s> it has been described in former pages how the elder pendennis had become the adviser of the clavering family and in his quality of intimate friend of the house had gone over every room of ii and even seen that ugly closet which we all of us have and in which according to the proverb the family skeleton is locked up <\s>
<s> about the baronet's pecuniary matters if the major did not know it was because clavering himself did not know them and hid them from himself and others in such a hopeless entanglement of lies that it was impossible for adviser or attorney or principal to get an accurate knowledge of his affairs <\s>
<s> but concerning lady clavering the major was much better informed and when the unlucky mishap of the derby arose he took upon himself to become completely and thoroughly acquainted with all her means whatsoever they were and was now accurately informed of the vast and repeated sacrifices which the widow amory had made in behalf of her present husband <\s>
<s> he did not conceal and he had won no small favour from miss blanche by avowing it his opinion that lady clavering's daughter had been hardly treated at the expense of her son by her second marriage and in his conversations with lady clavering had fairly hinted that he thought miss blanche ought to have a better provision <\s>
<s> we have said that he had already given the widow to understand that he knew all the particulars of her early and unfortunate history having been in india at the time when when the painful circumstances occurred which had ended in her parting from her first husband <\s>
<s> he could tell her where to find the calcutta newspaper which contained the account of amory's trial and he showed and the begum was not a little grateful to him for his forbearance how being aware all along of this mishap which had befallen her he had kept all knowledge of it to himself and been constantly the friend of her family <\s>
<s> interested motives my dear lady clavering he said of course i may have had <\s>
<s> we all have interested motives and mine i don't conceal from you was to make a marriage between my nephew and your daughter <\s>
<s> to which lady clavering perhaps with some surprise that the major should choose her family for a union with his own said she was quite willing to consent <\s>
<s> but frankly he said my dear lady my boy has but five hundred a year and a wife with ten thousand pounds to her fortune would scarcely better him <\s>
<s> we could do better for him than that permit me to say and he is a shrewd cautious young fellow who has sown his wild oats now who has very good parts and plenty of ambition and whose object in marrying is to better himself <\s>
<s> if you and sir francis chose and sir francis take my word for it will refuse you nothing you could put arthur in a way to advance very considerably in the world and show the stuff which he has in him <\s>
<s> of what use is that seat in parliament to clavering who scarcely ever shows his face in the house or speaks a word there <\s>
<s> i'm told by gentlemen who heard my boy at oxbridge that he was famous as an orator begad and once put his foot into the stirrup and mount him i've no doubt he won't be the last of the field ma'am <\s>
<s> i've tested the chap and know him pretty well i think <\s>
<s> he is much too lazy and careless and flighty a fellow to make a jog trot journey and arrive as your lawyers do at the end of their lives <\s>
<s> but give him a start and good friends and an opportunity and take my word for it he'll make himself a name that his sons shall be proud of <\s>
<s> i don't see any way for a fellow like him to parvenir but by making a prudent marriage not with a beggarly heiress to sit down for life upon a miserable fifteen hundred a year but with somebody whom he can help and who can help him forward in the world and whom he can give a good name and a station in the country begad in return for the advantages which she brings him <\s>
<s> it would be better for you to have a distinguished son in law than to keep your husband on in parliament who's of no good to himself or to anybody else there and that's i say why i've been interested about you and offer you what i think a good bargain for both <\s>
<s> you know i look upon arthur as one of the family almost now said the good natured begum he comes and goes when he likes and the more i think of his dear mother the more i see there's few people so good none so good to me <\s>
<s> and i'm sure i cried when i heard of her death and would have gone into mourning for her myself only black don't become me <\s>
<s> and i know who his mother wanted him to marry laura i mean whom old lady rockminster has taken such a fancy to and no wonder <\s>
<s> she's a better girl than my girl <\s>
<s> and my betsy blanche i mean ain't been a comfort to me major <\s>
<s> it's laura pen ought to marry <\s>
<s> marry on five hundred a year <\s>
<s> my dear good soul you are mad <\s>
<s> think over what i have said to you <\s>
<s> do nothing in your affairs with that unhappy husband of yours without consulting me and remember that old pendennis is always your friend <\s>
<s> for some time previous pen's uncle had held similar language to miss amory <\s>
<s> he had pointed out to her the convenience of the match which he had at heart and was bound to say that mutual convenience was of all things the very best in the world to marry upon the only thing <\s>
<s> look at your love marriages my dear young creature <\s>
<s> the love match people are the most notorious of all for quarrelling afterwards and a girl who runs away with jack to gretna green constantly runs away with tom to switzerland afterwards <\s>
<s> the great point in marriage is for people to agree to be useful to one another <\s>
<s> the lady brings the means and the gentleman avails himself of them <\s>
<s> my boy's wife brings the horse and begad pen goes in and wins the plate <\s>
