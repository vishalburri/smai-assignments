<s> i must go to bury street like a dutiful nephew <\s>
<s> and taking his hat pen prepared to go <\s>
<s> i will walk too said warrington <\s>
<s> and they descended the stairs stopping however at pen's chambers which as the reader has been informed were now on the lower story <\s>
<s> here pen began sprinkling himself with eau de cologne and carefully scenting his hair and whiskers with that odoriferous water <\s>
<s> what is the matter <\s>
<s> you've not been smoking <\s>
<s> is it my pipe that has poisoned you <\s>
<s> i am going to call upon some women said pen <\s>
<s> i'm i'm going to dine with em <\s>
<s> they are passing through town and are at an hotel in jermyn street <\s>
<s> warrington looked with good natured interest at the young fellow dandifying himself up to a pitch of completeness and appearing at length in a gorgeous shirt front and neckcloth fresh gloves and glistening boots <\s>
<s> george had a pair of thick high lows and his old shirt was torn about the breast and ragged at the collar where his blue beard had worn it <\s>
<s> well young un said he simply i like you to be a buck somehow <\s>
<s> when i walk about with you it is as if i had a rose in my button hole <\s>
<s> and you are still affable <\s>
<s> i don't think there is any young fellow in the temple turns out like you and i don't believe you were ever ashamed of walking with me yet <\s>
<s> don't laugh at me george <\s>
<s> i say pen continued the other sadly if you write if you write to laura i wish you would say god bless her from me <\s>
<s> pen blushed and then looked at warrington and then and then burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughing <\s>
<s> i'm going to dine with her he said <\s>
<s> i brought her and lady rockminster up from the country to day made two days of it slept last night at bath i say george come and dine too <\s>
<s> i may ask any one i please and the old lady is constantly talking about you <\s>
<s> george had an article to write <\s>
<s> george hesitated and oh strange to say <\s>
<s> at last he agreed to go <\s>
<s> it was agreed that they should go and call upon the ladies and they marched away in high spirits to the hotel in jermyn street <\s>
<s> once more the dear face shone upon him once more the sweet voice spoke to him and the tender hand pressed a welcome <\s>
<s> there still wanted half an hour to dinner <\s>
<s> you will go and see your uncle now mr <\s>
<s> pendennis old lady rockminster said <\s>
<s> you will not bring him to dinner no his old stories are intolerable and i want to talk to mr <\s>
<s> warrington i daresay he will amuse us <\s>
<s> i think we have heard all your stories <\s>
<s> we have been together for two whole days and i think we are getting tired of each other <\s>
<s> so obeying her ladyship's orders arthur went downstairs and walked to his uncle's lodgings <\s>
<s> fiat justitia the dinner was served when arthur returned and lady rockminster began to scold him for arriving late <\s>
<s> but laura looking at her cousin saw that his face was so pale and scared that she interrupted her imperious patroness and asked with tender alarm what had happened <\s>
<s> arthur drank a large bumper of sherry <\s>
<s> i have heard the most extraordinary news i will tell you afterwards he said looking at the servants <\s>
<s> he was very nervous and agitated during the dinner <\s>
<s> don't tramp and beat so with your feet under the table lady rockminster said <\s>
<s> you have trodden on fido and upset his saucer <\s>
<s> warrington keeps his boots quiet <\s>
<s> at the dessert it seemed as if the unlucky dinner would never be over lady rockminster said this dinner has been exceedingly stupid <\s>
<s> i suppose something has happened and that you want to speak to laura <\s>
<s> i will go and have my nap <\s>
<s> i am not sure that i shall have any tea no <\s>
<s> you must come again and when there is no business to talk about <\s>
<s> and the old lady tossing up her head walked away from the room with great dignity <\s>
<s> george and the others had risen with her and warrington was about to go away and was saying good night to laura who of course was looking much alarmed about her cousin when arthur said pray stay george <\s>
<s> you should hear my news too and give me your counsel in this case <\s>
<s> i hardly know how to act in it <\s>
<s> it's something about blanche arthur said laura her heart beating and her cheek blushing as she thought it had never blushed in her life <\s>
<s> yes and the most extraordinary story said pen <\s>
<s> when i left you to go to my uncle's lodgings i found his servant morgan who has been with him so long at the door and he said that he and his master had parted that morning that my uncle had quitted the house and had gone to an hotel this hotel <\s>
<s> i asked for him when i came in but he was gone out to dinner <\s>
<s> morgan then said that he had something of a most important nature to communicate to me and begged me to step into the house his house it is now <\s>
<s> it appears the scoundrel has saved a great deal of money whilst in my uncle's service and is now a capitalist and a millionaire for what i know <\s>
<s> well i went into the house and what do you think he told me <\s>
<s> this must be a secret between us all at least if we can keep it now that it is in possession of that villain <\s>
