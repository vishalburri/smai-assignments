<s> do you mean pen that you here the widow with eager eyes and outstretched hands was breaking out but laura stopped her silence hush dear mother she cried and the widow hushed <\s>
<s> savagely as pen spoke she was only too eager to hear what more he had to say <\s>
<s> go on arthur go on arthur was all she said almost swooning away as she spoke <\s>
<s> by gad i say he shan't go on or i won't hear him by gad the major said trembling too in his wrath <\s>
<s> if you choose sir after all we've done for you after all i've done for you myself to insult your mother and disgrace your name by allying yourself with a low born kitchen girl go and do it by gad but let us ma'am have no more to do with him <\s>
<s> i wash my hands of you sir i wash my hands of you <\s>
<s> i'm an old fellow i ain't long for this world <\s>
<s> i come of as ancient and honourable a family as any in england by gad and i did hope before i went off the hooks by gad that the fellow that i'd liked and brought up and nursed through life by jove would do something to show me that our name yes the name of pendennis by gad was left undishonoured behind us but if he won't dammy i say amen <\s>
<s> by g both my father and my brother jack were the proudest men in england and i never would have thought that there would come this disgrace to my name never and and i'm ashamed that it's arthur pendennis <\s>
<s> the old fellow's voice here broke off into a sob it was the second time that arthur had brought tears from those wrinkled lids <\s>
<s> the sound of his breaking voice stayed pen's anger instantly and he stopped pacing the room as he had been doing until that moment <\s>
<s> laura was by helen's sofa and warrington had remained hitherto an almost silent but not uninterested spectator of the family storm <\s>
<s> as the parties were talking it had grown almost dark and after the lull which succeeded the passionate outbreak of the major george's deep voice as it here broke trembling into the twilight room was heard with no small emotion by all <\s>
<s> will you let me tell you something about myself my kind friends <\s>
<s> he said you have been so good to me ma'am you have been so kind to me laura i hope i may call you so sometimes my dear pen and i have been such friends that i have long wanted to tell you my story such as it is and would have told it to you earlier but that it is a sad one and contains another's secret <\s>
