<s> his modest love could not show in public by any outward signs except the eyes with which the poor fellow ogled and gazed violently to be sure but it was dumb in the presence of third parties and so much the better for of all the talk which takes place in this world that of love makers is surely to the uninitiated the most silly <\s>
