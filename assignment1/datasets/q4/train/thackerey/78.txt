<s> my dear sister have you lost your senses <\s>

<s> my dear what is there in this <\s>

<s> no there's nothing in the story <\s>
<s> do you think so <\s>
<s> i'll take the letter to arthur and ask him now <\s>
<s> look at him there <\s>
<s> he's on the terrace with mr <\s>
<s> they are talking to some children <\s>
<s> he would have given his whole life and soul to win that prize which arthur rejected <\s>
<s> did she want fame <\s>
<s> he would have won it for her devotion a great heart full of pent up tenderness and manly love and gentleness was there for her if she might take it <\s>
<s> but it might not be <\s>
<s> fate had ruled otherwise <\s>
<s> even if i could she would not have me george thought <\s>
<s> what has an ugly rough old fellow like me to make any woman like him <\s>
<s> i'm getting old and i've made no mark in life <\s>
<s> i've neither good looks nor youth nor money nor reputation <\s>
<s> a man must be able to do something besides stare at her and offer on his knees his smooth devotion to make a woman like him <\s>
<s> what can i do <\s>
<s> lots of young fellows have passed me in the race what they call the prizes of life didn't seem to me worth the trouble of the struggle <\s>
<s> if she had been mine and liked a diamond ah <\s>
<s> shouldn't she have worn it <\s>
<s> psha what a fool i am to brag of what i would have done <\s>
<s> we are the slaves of destiny <\s>
<s> our lots are shaped for us and mine is ordained long ago <\s>
<s> come let us have a pipe and put the smell of these flowers out of court poor little silent flowers <\s>
<s> you'll be dead to morrow <\s>
<s> what business had you to show your red cheeks in this dingy place <\s>
<s> by his bedside george found a new bible which the widow had placed there with a note inside saying that she had not seen the book amongst his collection in a room where she had spent a number of hours and where god had vouchsafed to her prayers the life of her son and that she gave to arthur's friend the best thing she could and besought him to read in the volume sometimes and to keep it as a token of a grateful mother's regard and affection <\s>
<s> poor george mournfully kissed the book as he had done the flowers and the morning found him still reading in its awful pages in which so many stricken hearts in which so many tender and faithful souls have found comfort under calamity and refuge and hope in affliction <\s>
<s> fanny's occupation's gone good helen ever since her son's illness had taken as we have seen entire possession of the young man of his drawers and closets and all which they contained whether shirts that wanted buttons or stockings that required mending or must it be owned <\s>
<s> letters that lay amongst those articles of raiment and which of course it was necessary that somebody should answer during arthur's weakened and incapable condition <\s>
<s> pendennis was laudably desirous to have some explanations about the dreadful fanny bolton mystery regarding which she had never breathed a word to her son though it was present in her mind always and occasioned her inexpressible anxiety and disquiet <\s>
<s> she had caused the brass knocker to be screwed off the inner door of the chambers where upon the postman's startling double rap would as she justly argued disturb the rest of her patient and she did not allow him to see any letter which arrived whether from bootmakers who importuned him or hatters who had a heavy account to make up against next saturday and would be very much obliged if mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis would have the kindness to settle etc <\s>
<s> of these documents pen who was always freehanded and careless of course had his share and though no great one one quite enough to alarm his scrupulous and conscientious mother <\s>
<s> she had some savings pen's magnificent self denial and her own economy amounting from her great simplicity and avoidance of show to parsimony almost had enabled her to put by a little sum of money a part of which she delightedly consecrated to the paying off the young gentleman's obligations <\s>
<s> at this price many a worthy youth and respected reader would hand over his correspondence to his parents and perhaps there is no greater test of a man's regularity and easiness of conscience than his readiness to face the postman <\s>
<s> blessed is he who is made happy by the sound of the rat tat <\s>
<s> the good are eager for it but the naughty tremble at the sound thereof <\s>
<s> so it was very kind of mrs <\s>
