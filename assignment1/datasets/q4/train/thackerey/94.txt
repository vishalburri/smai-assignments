<s> in their mother's lifetime she had never spoken so openly or so cordially as now <\s>

<s> he was engaged to another woman and laura became his sister at once hiding or banishing from herself any doubts which she might have as to his choice striving to look cheerfully forward and hope for his prosperity promising herself to do all that affection might do to make her mother's darling happy <\s>
<s> their talk was often about the departed mother <\s>
<s> and it was from a thousand stories which laura told him that arthur was made aware how constant and absorbing that silent maternal devotion had been which had accompanied him present and absent through life and had only ended with the fond widow's last breath <\s>
<s> one day the people in clavering saw a lad in charge of a couple of horses at the churchyard gate and it was told over the place that pen and laura had visited helen's grave together <\s>
<s> since arthur had come down into the country he had been there once or twice but the sight of the sacred stone had brought no consolation to him <\s>
<s> a guilty man doing a guilty deed a mere speculator content to lay down his faith and honour for a fortune and a worldly career and owning that his life was but a contemptible surrender what right had he in the holy place <\s>
<s> what booted it to him in the world he lived in that others were no better than himself <\s>
<s> arthur and laura rode by the gates of fairoaks and he shook hands with his tenant's children playing on the lawn and the terrace laura looked steadily at the cottage wall at the creeper on the porch and the magnolia growing up to her window <\s>
<s> pendennis rode by to day one of the boys told his mother with a lady and he stopped and talked to us and he asked for a bit of honeysuckle off the porch and gave it the lady <\s>
<s> i couldn't see if she was pretty she had her veil down <\s>
<s> she was riding one of cramp's horses out of baymouth <\s>
<s> as they rode over the downs between home and baymouth pen did not speak much though they rode very close together <\s>
<s> he was thinking what a mockery life was and how men refuse happiness when they may have it or having it kick it down or barter it with their eyes open for a little worthless money or beggarly honour <\s>
<s> and then the thought came what does it matter for the little space <\s>
<s> the lives of the best and purest of us are consumed in a vain desire and end in a disappointment as the dear soul's who sleeps in her grave yonder <\s>
<s> she had her selfish ambition as much as caesar had and died baulked of her life's longing <\s>
<s> the stone covers over our hopes and our memories <\s>
<s> our place knows us not <\s>
<s> other people's children are playing on the grass he broke out in a hard voice where you and i used to play laura <\s>
<s> and you see how the magnolia we planted has grown up since our time <\s>
<s> i have been round to one or two of the cottages where my mother used to visit <\s>
<s> it is scarcely more than a year that she is gone and the people whom she used to benefit care no more for her death than for queen anne's <\s>
<s> we are all selfish the world is selfish there are but a few exceptions like you my dear to shine like good deeds in a naughty world and make the blackness more dismal <\s>
<s> i wish you would not speak in that way arthur said laura looking down and bending her head to the honeysuckle on her breast <\s>
<s> when you told the little boy to give me this you were not selfish <\s>
<s> a pretty sacrifice i made to get it for you <\s>
<s> but your heart was kind and full of love when you did so <\s>
<s> one cannot ask for more than love and kindness and if you think humbly of yourself arthur the love and kindness are diminished are they <\s>
<s> i often thought our dearest mother spoiled you at home by worshipping you and that if you are i hate the word what you say her too great fondness helped to make you so <\s>
<s> and as for the world when men go out into it i suppose they cannot be otherwise than selfish <\s>
<s> you have to fight for yourself and to get on for yourself and to make a name for yourself <\s>
<s> mamma and your uncle both encouraged you in this ambition <\s>
<s> if it is a vain thing why pursue it <\s>
<s> i suppose such a clever man as you intend to do a great deal of good to the country by going into parliament or you would not wish to be there <\s>
<s> what are you going to do when you are in the house of commons <\s>
<s> women don't understand about politics my dear pen said sneering at himself as he spoke <\s>
<s> but why don't you make us understand <\s>
<s> i could never tell about mr <\s>
<s> pynsent why he should like to be there so much <\s>
<s> he is not a clever man he certainly is not a genius pynsent said pen <\s>
<s> lady diana says that he attends committees all day that then again he is at the house all night that he always votes as he is told that he never speaks that he will never get on beyond a subordinate place and as his grandmother tells him he is choked with red tape <\s>
<s> are you going to follow the same career arthur <\s>
<s> what is there in it so brilliant that you should be so eager for it <\s>
<s> i would rather that you should stop at home and write books good books kind books with gentle kind thoughts such as you have dear arthur and such as might do people good to read <\s>
<s> and if you do not win fame what then <\s>
<s> you own it is vanity and you can live very happily without it <\s>
<s> i must not pretend to advise but i take you at your own word about the world and as you own it is wicked and that it tires you ask you why you don't leave it <\s>
<s> and what would you have me do <\s>
<s> i would have you bring your wife to fairoaks to live there and study and do good round about you <\s>
<s> i would like to see your own children playing on the lawn arthur and that we might pray in our mother's church again once more dear brother <\s>
<s> if the world is a temptation are we not told to pray that we may not be led into it <\s>
<s> do you think blanche would make a good wife for a petty country gentleman <\s>
<s> do you think i should become the character very well laura <\s>
<s> remember temptation walks about the hedgerows as well as the city streets and idleness is the greatest tempter of all <\s>
<s> said laura as a blush mounted up to her cheek and of which pen saw the fervour though laura's veil fell over her face to hide it <\s>
<s> pen rode on by laura's side silently for a while <\s>
<s> george's name so mentioned brought back the past to him and the thoughts which he had once had regarding george and laura <\s>
<s> why should the recurrence of the thought agitate him now that he knew the union was impossible <\s>
<s> why should he be curious to know if during the months of their intimacy laura had felt a regard for warrington <\s>
<s> from that day until the present time george had never alluded to his story and arthur remembered now that since then george had scarcely ever mentioned laura's name <\s>
<s> at last he cane close to her <\s>
<s> tell me something laura he said <\s>
<s> she put back her veil and looked at him <\s>
<s> what is it arthur <\s>
<s> she asked though from the tremor of her voice she guessed very well <\s>
<s> tell me but for george's misfortune i never knew him speak of it before or since that day would you would you have given him what you refused me <\s>
<s> yes pen she said bursting into tears <\s>
<s> he deserved you better than i did poor arthur groaned forth with an indescribable pang at his heart <\s>
<s> i am but a selfish wretch and george is better nobler truer than i am <\s>
<s> yes pen said laura reaching out her hand to her cousin and he put his arm round her and for a moment she sobbed on his shoulder <\s>
<s> the gentle girl had had her secret and told it <\s>
<s> in the widow's last journey from fairoaks when hastening with her mother to arthur's sick bed laura had made a different confession and it was only when warrington told his own story and described the hopeless condition of his life that she discovered how much her feelings had changed and with what tender sympathy with what great respect delight and admiration she had grown to regard her cousin's friend <\s>
<s> until she knew that some plans she might have dreamed of were impossible and that warrington reading in her heart perhaps had told his melancholy story to warn her she had not asked herself whether it was possible that her affections could change and had been shocked and seared by the discovery of the truth <\s>
<s> how should she have told it to helen and confessed her shame <\s>
<s> poor laura felt guilty before her friend with the secret which she dared not confide to her felt as if she had been ungrateful for helen's love and regard felt as if she had been wickedly faithless to pen in withdrawing that love from him which he did not even care to accept humbled even and repentant before warrington lest she should have encouraged him by undue sympathy or shown the preference which she began to feel <\s>
<s> the catastrophe which broke up laura's home and the grief and anguish which she felt for her mother's death gave her little leisure for thoughts more selfish and by the time she rallied from that grief the minor one was also almost cured <\s>
<s> it was but for a moment that she had indulged a hope about warrington <\s>
<s> her admiration and respect for him remained as strong as ever <\s>
<s> but the tender feeling with which she knew she had regarded him was schooled into such calmness that it may be said to have been dead and passed away <\s>
<s> the pang which it left behind was one of humility and remorse <\s>
<s> oh how wicked and proud i was about arthur she thought how self confident and unforgiving <\s>
<s> i never forgave from my heart this poor girl who was fond of him or him for encouraging her love and i have been more guilty than she poor little artless creature <\s>
<s> i professing to love one man could listen to another only too eagerly and would not pardon the change of feelings in arthur whilst i myself was changing and unfaithful and so humiliating herself and acknowledging her weakness the poor girl sought for strength and refuge in the manner in which she had been accustomed to look for them <\s>
<s> she had done no wrong but there are some folks who suffer for a fault ever so trifling as much as others whose stout consciences can walk under crimes of almost any weight and poor laura chose to fancy that she had acted in this delicate juncture of her life as a very great criminal <\s>
<s> she determined that she had done pen a great injury by withdrawing that love which privately in her mother's hearing she had bestowed upon him that she had been ungrateful to her dead benefactress by ever allowing herself to think of another or of violating her promise and that considering her own enormous crimes she ought to be very gentle in judging those of others whose temptations were much greater very likely and whose motives she could not understand <\s>

<s> blanche may not be so light minded as she seemed and who am i to be her judge <\s>
