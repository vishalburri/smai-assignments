<s> they had their banns published at st <\s>
<s> clement's and nobody heard it or knew any just cause or impediment <\s>
<s> and one day she slips out of the porter's lodge and has the business done and goes off to gravesend with lothario and leaves a note for me to go and explain all things to her ma <\s>
<s> the old woman knew it as well as i did though she pretended ignorance <\s>
<s> and so she goes and i'm alone again <\s>
<s> i miss her sir tripping along that court and coming for her singing lesson and i've no heart to look into the porter's lodge now which looks very empty without her the little flirting thing <\s>
<s> and i go and sit and dangle about her lodgings like an old fool <\s>
<s> she makes em very trim and nice though gets up all huxter's shirts and clothes cooks his little dinner and sings at her business like a little lark <\s>
<s> what's the use of being angry <\s>
<s> i lent em three pound to go on with for they haven't got a shilling till the reconciliation and pa comes down <\s>
<s> when bows had taken his leave pen carried his letter from blanche and the news which he had just received to his usual adviser laura <\s>
<s> it was wonderful upon how many points mr <\s>
<s> arthur who generally followed his own opinion now wanted another person's counsel <\s>
<s> he could hardly so much as choose a waistcoat without referring to miss bell if he wanted to buy a horse he must have miss bell's opinion all which marks of deference tended greatly to the amusement of the shrewd old lady with whom miss bell lived and whose plans regarding her protegee we have indicated <\s>
<s> arthur produced blanche's letter then to laura and asked her to interpret it <\s>
<s> laura was very much agitated and puzzled by the contents of the note <\s>
<s> it seems to me she said as if blanche is acting very artfully <\s>
<s> and wishes so to place matters that she may take me or leave me <\s>
<s> is it not so <\s>
<s> it is i am afraid a kind of duplicity which does not augur well for your future happiness and is a bad reply to your own candour and honesty arthur <\s>
<s> do you know i think i think i scarcely like to say what i think said laura with a deep blush but of course the blushing young lady yielded to her cousin's persuasion and expressed what her thoughts were <\s>
<s> it looks to me arthur as if there might be there might be somebody else said laura with a repetition of the blush <\s>
<s> and if there is broke in arthur and if i am free once again will the best and dearest of all women you are not free dear brother laura said calmly <\s>
<s> you belong to another of whom i own it grieves me to think ill <\s>
<s> but i can't do otherwise <\s>
<s> it is very odd that in this letter she does not urge you to tell her the reason why you have broken arrangements which would have been so advantageous to you and avoids speaking on the subject <\s>
<s> she somehow seems to write as if she knows her father's secret <\s>
<s> pen said yes she must know it and told the story which he had just heard from huxter of the interview at shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> it was not so that she described the meeting said laura and going to her desk produced from it that letter of blanche's which mentioned her visit to shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> another disappointment only the chevalier strong and a friend of his in the room <\s>
<s> this was all that blanche had said <\s>
<s> but she was bound to keep her father's secret pen laura added <\s>
<s> and yet and yet it is very puzzling <\s>
<s> the puzzle was this that for three weeks after this eventful discovery blanche had been only too eager about her dearest arthur was urging as strongly as so much modesty could urge the completion of the happy arrangements which were to make her arthur's for ever and now it seemed as if something had interfered to mar these happy arrangements as if arthur poor was not quite so agreeable to blanche as arthur rich and a member of parliament as if there was some mystery <\s>
