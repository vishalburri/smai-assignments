<s> bungay the faithful fellow worked round to the point which he had very near at heart viz the liberation from prison of his admired friend and chief captain shandon <\s>
<s> he knew to a shilling the amount of the detainers which were against the captain at the porter's lodge of the fleet and indeed professed to know all his debts though this was impossible for no man in england certainly not the captain himself was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> he pointed out what shandon's engagements already were and how much better he would work if removed from confinement though this mr <\s>
<s> bungay denied for when the captain's locked up he said we are sure to find him at home whereas when he's free you can never catch hold of him ); finally he so worked on mr <\s>
<s> bungay's feelings by describing mrs <\s>
<s> shandon pining away in the prison and the child sickening there that the publisher was induced to promise that if mrs <\s>
<s> shandon would come to him in the morning he would see what could be done <\s>
<s> and the colloquy ending at this time with the second round of brandy and water although finucane who had four guineas in his pocket would have discharged the tavern reckoning with delight bungay said no sir this is my affair sir if you please <\s>

<s> thus it was that finucane who went to bed at the temple after the dinner at dick's found himself actually with his week's salary intact upon saturday morning <\s>
<s> shandon a wink so knowing and joyful that that kind creature knew some good news was in store for her and hastened to get her bonnet and shawl when fin asked if he might have the honour of taking her a walk and giving her a little fresh air <\s>
<s> and little mary jumped for joy at the idea of this holiday for finucane never neglected to give her a toy or to take her to a show and brought newspaper orders in his pocket for all sorts of london diversions to amuse the child <\s>
<s> indeed he loved them with all his heart and would cheerfully have dashed out his rambling brains to do them or his adored captain a service <\s>
<s> may i go charley <\s>
<s> or shall i stay with you for you're poorly dear this morning <\s>
<s> he's got a headache mr <\s>
<s> he suffers from headaches and i persuaded him to stay in bed mrs <\s>
<s> go along with you and polly <\s>
<s> jack take care of em <\s>
<s> hand me over the burton's anatomy and leave me to my abominable devices shandon said with perfect good humour <\s>
<s> he was writing and not uncommonly took his greek and latin quotations of which he knew the use as a public writer from that wonderful repertory of learning <\s>
<s> so fin gave his arm to mrs <\s>
<s> shandon and mary went skipping down the passages of the prison and through the gate into the free air <\s>
<s> from fleet street to paternoster row is not very far <\s>
<s> as the three reached mr <\s>
<s> bungay was also entering at the private door holding in her hand a paper parcel and a manuscript volume bound in red and indeed containing an account of her transactions with the butcher in the neighbouring market <\s>
<s> bungay was in a gorgeous shot silk dress which flamed with red and purple she wore a yellow shawl and had red flowers inside her bonnet and a brilliant light blue parasol <\s>
<s> shandon was in an old black watered silk her bonnet had never seen very brilliant days of prosperity any more than its owner but she could not help looking like a lady whatever her attire was <\s>
<s> the two women curtsied to each other each according to her fashion <\s>
<s> i hope you're pretty well mum <\s>
<s> it's a very fine day said mrs <\s>
<s> won't you step in mum <\s>
<s> bungay looking so hard at the child as almost to frighten her <\s>
<s> i i came about business with mr <\s>
<s> bungay i i hope he's pretty well <\s>
<s> if you go to see him in the counting house couldn't you couldn't you leave your little gurl with me <\s>
<s> bungay in a deep voice and with a tragic look as she held out one finger towards the child <\s>
<s> i want to stay with mamma cried little mary burying her face in her mother's dress <\s>
<s> go with this lady mary my dear said the mother <\s>
<s> i'll show you some pretty pictures said mrs <\s>
<s> bungay with the voice of an ogress and some nice things besides look here and opening her brown paper parcel mrs <\s>
<s> bungay displayed some choice sweet buscuits such as her bungay loved after his wine <\s>
<s> little mary followed after this attraction the whole party entering at the private entrance from which a side door led into mr <\s>
<s> here however as the child was about to part from her mother her courage again failed her and again she ran to the maternal petticoat upon which the kind and gentle mrs <\s>
<s> shandon seeing the look of disappointment in mrs <\s>
