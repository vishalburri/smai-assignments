<s> faithful to his plan major pendennis gave his nephew no let or hindrance but somehow the constant feeling that the senior's eye was upon him an uneasy shame attendant upon that inevitable confession which the evening's conversation would be sure to elicit in the most natural simple manner made pen go less frequently to sigh away his soul at the feet of his charmer than he had been wont to do previous to his uncle's arrival <\s>

<s> the discreet and ingenious mr <\s>
<s> morgan a london confidential valet whose fidelity could be trusted had been to chatteris more than once and made every inquiry regarding the past history and present habits of the captain and his daughter <\s>

<s> from the servants of the officers at the barracks mr <\s>
<s> 3 was somewhat more confidential and showed that matters had proceeded rather far <\s>
<s> you were odious yesterday night the letter said <\s>
<s> why did you not come to the stage door <\s>
<s> papa could not escort me on account of his eye he had an accident and fell down over a loose carpet on the stair on sunday night <\s>
<s> i saw you looking at miss diggle all night and you were so enchanted with lydia languish you scarcely once looked at julia <\s>
<s> i could have crushed bingley i was so angry <\s>
<s> i play ella rosenberg on friday will you come then <\s>
<s> miss diggle performs ever your e <\s>
<s> these three letters mr <\s>
<s> pen used to read at intervals during the day and night and embrace with that delight and fervour which such beautiful compositions surely warranted <\s>
<s> a thousand times at least he had kissed fondly the musky satin paper made sacred to him by the hand of emily fotheringay <\s>
<s> this was all he had in return for his passion and flames his vows and protests his rhymes and similes his wakeful nights and endless thoughts his fondness fears and folly <\s>
<s> the young wiseacre had pledged away his all for this signed his name to endless promissory notes conferring his heart upon the bearer bound himself for life and got back twopence as an equivalent <\s>
<s> for miss costigan was a young lady of such perfect good conduct and self command that she never would have thought of giving more and reserved the treasures of her affection until she could transfer them lawfully at church <\s>
<s> pen was content with what tokens of regard he had got and mumbled over his three letters in a rapture of high spirits and went to sleep delighted with his kind old uncle from london who must evidently yield to his wishes in time and in a word in a preposterous state of contentment with himself and all the world <\s>
<s> in which the major opens the campaign let those who have a real and heartfelt relish for london society and the privilege of an entree into its most select circles admit that major pendennis was a man of no ordinary generosity and affection in the sacrifice which he now made <\s>
<s> he gave up london in may his newspapers and his mornings his afternoons from club to club his little confidential visits to my ladies his rides in rotten row his dinners and his stall at the opera his rapid escapades to fulham or richmond on saturdays and sundays his bow from my lord duke or my lord marquis at the great london entertainments and his name in the morning post of the succeeding day his quieter little festivals more select secret and delightful all these he resigned to lock himself into a lone little country house with a simple widow and a greenhorn of a son a mawkish curate and a little girl of ten years of age <\s>
<s> he made the sacrifice and it was the greater that few knew the extent of it <\s>
<s> his letters came down franked from town and he showed the invitations to helen with a sigh <\s>
<s> it was beautiful and tragical to see him refuse one party after another at least to those who could understand as helen didn't the melancholy grandeur of his self denial <\s>
<s> helen did not or only smiled at the awful pathos with which the major spoke of the court guide in general but young pen looked with great respect at the great names upon the superscriptions of his uncle's letters and listened to the major's stories about the fashionable world with constant interest and sympathy <\s>
<s> the elder pendennis's rich memory was stored with thousands of these delightful tales and he poured them into pen's willing ear with unfailing eloquence <\s>
<s> he knew the name and pedigree of everybody in the peerage and everybody's relations <\s>
<s> my dear boy he would say with a mournful earnestness and veracity you cannot begin your genealogical studies too early i wish to heavens you would read in debrett every day <\s>
<s> not so much the historical part for the pedigrees between ourselves are many of them very fabulous and there are few families that can show such a clear descent as our own as the account of family alliances and who is related to whom <\s>
<s> i have known a man's career in life blasted by ignorance on this important this all important subject <\s>
<s> why only last month at dinner at my lord hobanob's a young man who has lately been received among us young mr <\s>
<s> suckling author of a work i believe began to speak lightly of admiral bowser's conduct for ratting to ministers in what i must own is the most audacious manner <\s>
<s> but who do you think sate next and opposite to this mr <\s>
<s> why why next to him was lady grampound bowser's daughter and opposite to him was lord grampound bowser's son in law <\s>
<s> the infatuated young man went on cutting his jokes at the admiral's expense fancying that all the world was laughing with him and i leave you to imagine lady hobanob's feelings hobanob's those of every well bred man as the wretched intru was so exposing himself <\s>
<s> he will never dine again in south street <\s>
<s> i promise you that <\s>
<s> with such discourses the major entertained his nephew as he paced the terrace in front of the house for his two hours constitutional walk or as they sate together after dinner over their wine <\s>
<s> he grieved that sir francis clavering had not come down to the park to live in it since his marriage and to make a society for the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> he mourned that lord eyrie was not in the country that he might take pen and present him to his lordship <\s>
<s> he has daughters the major said <\s>
<s> you might have married lady emily or lady barbara trehawk but all those dreams are over my poor fellow you must lie on the bed which you have made for yourself <\s>
<s> these things to hear did young pendennis seriously incline <\s>
<s> they are not so interesting in print as when delivered orally but the major's anecdotes of the great george of the royal dukes of the statesmen beauties and fashionable ladies of the day filled young pen's soul with longing and wonder and he found the conversations with his guardian which sadly bored and perplexed poor mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis for his own part never tedious <\s>
<s> it can't be said that mr <\s>
<s> pen's new guide philosopher and friend discoursed him on the most elevated subjects or treated the subjects which he chose in the most elevated manner <\s>
<s> but his morality such as it was was consistent <\s>
<s> it might not perhaps tend to a man's progress in another world but it was pretty well calculated to advance his interests in this and then it must be remembered that the major never for one instant doubted that his views were the only views practicable and that his conduct was perfectly virtuous and respectable <\s>
<s> he was a man of honour in a word and had his eyes what he called open <\s>
<s> he took pity on this young greenhorn of a nephew and wanted to open his eyes too <\s>
<s> no man for instance went more regularly to church when in the country than the old bachelor <\s>
<s> it don't matter so much in town pen he said for there the women go and the men are not missed <\s>
<s> but when a gentleman is sur ses terres he must give an example to the country people and if i could turn a tune i even think i should sing <\s>
<s> the duke of saint david's whom i have the honour of knowing always sings in the country and let me tell you it has a doosed fine effect from the family pew <\s>
<s> and you are somebody down here <\s>
<s> as long as the claverings are away you are the first man in the parish and as good as any <\s>
<s> you might represent the town if you played your cards well <\s>
<s> your poor dear father would have done so had he lived so might you not if you marry a lady however amiable whom the country people won't meet well well it's a painful subject <\s>
<s> let us change it my boy <\s>
<s> but if major pendennis changed the subject once he recurred to it a score of times in the day and the moral of his discourse always was that pen was throwing himself away <\s>
<s> now it does not require much coaxing or wheedling to make a simple boy believe that he is a very fine fellow <\s>
<s> pen took his uncle's counsels to heart <\s>
<s> he was glad enough we have said to listen to his elder's talk <\s>
<s> the conversation of captain costigan became by no means pleasant to him and the idea of that tipsy old father in law haunted him with terror <\s>
<s> he couldn't bring that man unshaven and reeking of punch to associate with his mother <\s>
<s> even about emily he faltered when the pitiless guardian began to question him <\s>
<s> he was obliged to own no <\s>
<s> well she had a very good average intellect but he could not absolutely say she was clever <\s>
<s> come let us see some of her letters <\s>
<s> so pen confessed that he had but those three of which we have made mention and that they were but trivial invitations or answers <\s>
<s> she is cautious enough the major said drily <\s>
<s> she is older than you my poor boy and then he apologised with the utmost frankness and humility and flung himself upon pen's good feelings begging the lad to excuse a fond old uncle who had only his family's honour in view for arthur was ready to flame up in indignation whenever miss costigan's honesty was doubted and swore that he would never have her name mentioned lightly and never never would part from her <\s>
<s> he repeated this to his uncle and his friends at home and also it must be confessed to miss fotheringay and the amiable family at chatteris with whom he still continued to spend some portion of his time <\s>
<s> miss emily was alarmed when she heard of the arrival of pen's guardian and rightly conceived that the major came down with hostile intentions to herself <\s>
<s> i suppose ye intend to leave me now your grand relation has come down from town <\s>
<s> he'll carry ye off and you'll forget your poor emily mr <\s>
<s> in her presence in that of miss rouncy the columbine and milly's confidential friend of the company in the presence of the captain himself pen swore he never could think of any other woman but his beloved miss fotheringay and the captain looking up at his foils which were hung as a trophy on the wall of the room where pen and he used to fence grimly said he would not advoise any man to meddle rashly with the affections of his darling child and would never believe his gallant young arthur whom he treated as his son whom he called his son would ever be guilty of conduct so revolting to every idaya of honour and humanity <\s>
<s> he went up and embraced pen after speaking <\s>
<s> he cried and wiped his eye with one large dirty hand as he clasped pen with the other <\s>
<s> arthur shuddered in that grasp and thought of his uncle at home <\s>
<s> his father in law looked unusually dirty and shabby the odour of whisky and water was even more decided than in common <\s>
<s> how was he to bring that man and his mother together <\s>
<s> he trembled when he thought that he had absolutely written to costigan enclosing to him a sovereign the loan of which the worthy gentleman had need and saying that one day he hoped to sign himself his affectionate son arthur pendennis <\s>
