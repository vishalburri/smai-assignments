<s> we're both boniface men my name's warrington <\s>
<s> are you st warrington <\s>
<s> pen said delighted to see this hero <\s>
<s> warrington laughed stunning warrington yes he said i recollect you in your freshman's term <\s>
<s> but you appear to have quite cut me out <\s>
<s> the college talks about you still said pen who had a generous admiration for talent and pluck <\s>
<s> the bargeman you thrashed bill simes don't you remember wants you up again at oxbridge <\s>
<s> the miss notleys the haberdashers hush <\s>
<s> said warrington glad to make your acquaintance pendennis <\s>
<s> heard a good deal about you <\s>
<s> the young men were friends immediately and at once deep in college talk <\s>
<s> and pen who had been acting rather the fine gentleman on a previous day when he pretended to lowton that he could not drink port wine at dinner seeing warrington take his share with a great deal of gusto did not scruple about helping himself any more rather to the disappointment of honest lowton <\s>
<s> when the dinner was over warrington asked arthur where he was going <\s>
<s> i thought of going home to dress and hear grisi in norma pen said <\s>
<s> are you going to meet anybody there <\s>
<s> pen said no only to hear the music of which he was fond <\s>
<s> you had much better come home and smoke a pipe with me said warrington a very short one <\s>
<s> come i live close by in lamb court and we'll talk over boniface and old times <\s>
<s> they went away lowton sighed after them <\s>
<s> he knew warrington was a baronet's son and he looked up with simple reverence to all the aristocracy <\s>
<s> pen and warrington became sworn friends from that night <\s>
<s> warrington's cheerfulness and jovial temper his good sense his rough welcome and his never failing pipe of tobacco charmed pen who found it more pleasant to dive into shilling taverns with him than to dine in solitary state amongst the silent and polite frequenters of the polyanthus <\s>
<s> ere long pen gave up the lodgings in st <\s>
<s> james's to which he had migrated on quitting his hotel and found it was much more economical to take up his abode with warrington in lamb court and furnish and occupy his friend's vacant room there <\s>
<s> for it must be said of pen that no man was more easily led than he to do a thing when it was a novelty or when he had a mind to it <\s>
<s> and pidgeon the youth and flanagan the laundress divided their allegiance now between warrington and pen <\s>
<s> old and new acquaintances elated with the idea of seeing life pen went into a hundred queer london haunts <\s>
<s> he liked to think he was consorting with all sorts of men so he beheld coalheavers in their tap rooms boxers in their inn parlours honest citizens disporting in the suburbs or on the river and he would have liked to hob and nob with celebrated pickpockets or drink a pot of ale with a company of burglars and cracksmen had chance afforded him an opportunity of making the acquaintance of this class of society <\s>
<s> it was good to see the gravity with which warrington listened to the tutbury pet or the brighton stunner at the champion's arms and behold the interest which he took in the coalheaving company assembled at the fox under the hill <\s>
<s> his acquaintance with the public houses of the metropolis and its neighbourhood and with the frequenters of their various parlours was prodigious <\s>
<s> he was the personal friend of the landlord and landlady and welcome to the bar as to the clubroom <\s>
<s> he liked their society he said better than that of his own class whose manners annoyed him and whose conversation bored him <\s>
<s> in society he used to say everybody is the same wears the same dress eats and drinks and says the same things one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another one miss at a ball exactly resembles another whereas there's character here <\s>
<s> i like to talk with the strongest man in england or the man who can drink the most beer in england or with that tremendous republican of a hatter who thinks thistlewood was the greatest character in history <\s>
<s> i like better gin and water than claret <\s>
<s> i like a sanded floor in carnaby market better than a chalked one in mayfair <\s>
<s> i prefer snobs i own it <\s>
<s> indeed this gentleman was a social republican and it never entered his head while conversing with jack and tom that he was in any respect their better although perhaps the deference which they paid him might secretly please him <\s>
<s> pen followed him then to these various resorts of men with great glee and assiduity <\s>
<s> but he was considerably younger and therefore much more pompous and stately than warrington in fact a young prince in disguise visiting the poor of his father's kingdom <\s>
<s> they respected him as a high chap a fine fellow a regular young swell <\s>
<s> he had somehow about him an air of imperious good humour and a royal frankness and majesty although he was only heir apparent to twopence halfpenny and but one in descent from a gallypot <\s>
