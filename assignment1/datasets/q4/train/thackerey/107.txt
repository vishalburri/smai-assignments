<s> although lady rockminster grumbled a little at laura's preference for pendennis over bluebeard those who are aware of the latter's secret will understand that the young girl could make no other choice and the kind old lady who had constituted herself miss bell's guardian was not ill pleased that she was to fulfil the great purpose in life of young ladies and marry <\s>

<s> beck who was perfectly aware of every single circumstance and kept by martha of fairoaks in the fullest knowledge of what was passing was immensely surprised and delighted <\s>
<s> pendennis's income is so much the railroad will give him so much more he states miss bell has so much and may probably have a little more one day <\s>
<s> for persons in their degree they will be able to manage very well <\s>
<s> and i shall speak to my nephew pynsent who i suspect was once rather attached to her but of course that was out of the question oh <\s>
<s> of course my lady i should think so indeed not that you know anything whatever about it or have any business to think at all on the subject i shall speak to george pynsent who is now chief secretary of the tape and sealing wax office and have mr <\s>
<s> and beck in the morning you will carry down my compliments to major pendennis and say that i shall pay him a visit at one o'clock yes muttered the old lady the major must be reconciled and he must leave his fortune to laura's children <\s>
<s> accordingly at one o'clock the dowager lady rockminster appeared at major pendennis's who was delighted as may be imagined to receive so noble a visitor <\s>
<s> the major had been prepared if not for the news which her ladyship was about to give him at least with the intelligence that pen's marriage with miss amory was broken off <\s>
<s> the young gentleman bethinking him of his uncle for the first time that day it must be owned and meeting his new servant in the hall of the hotel asked after the major's health from mr <\s>
<s> frosch and then went into the coffee room of the hotel where he wrote a half dozen lines to acquaint his guardian with what had occurred <\s>
<s> dear uncle he said if there has been any question between us it is over now <\s>
<s> i went to tunbridge wells yesterday and found that somebody else had carried off the prize about which we were hesitating <\s>
<s> miss a without any compunction for me has bestowed herself upon harry foker with his fifteen thousand a year <\s>
<s> i came in suddenly upon their loves and found and left him in possession <\s>
<s> and you'll be glad to hear tatham writes me that he has sold three of my fields at fairoaks to the railroad company at a great figure <\s>
<s> i will tell you this and more when we meet and am always your affectionate a <\s>
<s> i think i am aware of what you were about to tell me the major said with a most courtly smile and bow to pen's ambassadress <\s>
<s> it was a very great kindness of your ladyship to think of bringing me the news <\s>
<s> how well you look <\s>
<s> how very good you are <\s>
<s> how very kind you have always been to that young man <\s>
<s> it was for the sake of his uncle said lady rockminster most politely <\s>
<s> he has informed me of the state of affairs and written me a nice note yes a nice note continued the old gentleman and i find he has had an increase to his fortune yes and all things considered i don't much regret that this affair with miss amory is manquee though i wished for it once in fact all things considered i am very glad of it <\s>
<s> we must console him major pendennis continued the lady we must get him a wife <\s>
<s> the truth then came across the major's mind and he saw for what purpose lady rockminster had chosen to assume the office of ambassadress <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to enter into the conversation which ensued or to tell at any length how her ladyship concluded a negotiation which in truth was tolerably easy <\s>
<s> there could be no reason why pen should not marry according to his own and his mother's wish and as for lady rockminster she supported the marriage by intimations which had very great weight with the major but of which we shall say nothing as her ladyship now of course much advanced in years is still alive and the family might be angry and in fine the old gentleman was quite overcome by the determined graciousness of the lady and her fondness for laura <\s>
<s> nothing indeed could be more bland and kind than lady rockminster's whole demeanour except for one moment when the major talked about his boy throwing himself away at which her ladyship broke out into a little speech in which she made the major understand what poor pen and his friends acknowledge very humbly that laura was a thousand times too good for him <\s>
<s> laura was fit to be the wife of a king laura was a paragon of virtue and excellence <\s>
<s> and it must be said that when major pendennis found that a lady of the rank of the countess of rockminster seriously admired miss bell he instantly began to admire her himself <\s>
<s> so that when herr frosch was requested to walk upstairs to lady rockminster's apartments and inform miss bell and mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis that the major would receive them and laura appeared blushing and happy as she hung on pen's arm the major gave a shaky hand to one and the other with unaffected emotion and cordiality and then went through another salutation to laura which caused her to blush still more <\s>

<s> the story teller turns from this group to his young audience and hopes that one day their eyes may all shine so <\s>
<s> pen having retreated in the most friendly manner and the lovely blanche having bestowed her young affections upon a blushing bridegroom with fifteen thousand a year there was such an outbreak of happiness in lady clavering's heart and family as the good begum had not known for many a year and she and blanche were on the most delightful terms of cordiality and affection <\s>
<s> the ardent foker pressed onwards the happy day and was as anxious as might be expected to abridge the period of mourning which had put him in possession of so many charms and amiable qualities of which he had been only as it were the heir apparent not the actual owner until then <\s>
