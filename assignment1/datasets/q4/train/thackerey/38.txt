<s> he has a croix he is very distingue he has beautiful eyes <\s>
<s> the poor fellow is mad for your beaux yeux i believe strong said <\s>
<s> he is a very good cook but he is not quite right in the head <\s>
<s> what did you say to him in the unknown tongue <\s>
<s> he is a gascon and comes from the borders of spain strong answered <\s>
<s> i told him he would lose his place if he walked with you <\s>
<s> did you see the look he gave pendennis strong asked enjoying the idea of the mischief i think he would like to run little pen through with one of his spits <\s>
<s> he is an odious conceited clumsy creature that mr <\s>
<s> broadfoot looked as if he would like to kill him too so did pynsent strong said <\s>
<s> what ice will you have water ice or cream ice <\s>
<s> who is that odd man staring at me he is decore too <\s>
<s> that is my friend colonel altamont a very queer character in the service of the nawaub of lucknow <\s>
<s> i'll be back in an instant said the chevalier and sprang out of the room to the ballroom where a scuffle and a noise of high voices was heard <\s>
<s> the refreshment room in which miss amory now found herself was a room set apart for the purposes of supper which mr <\s>
<s> rincer the landlord had provided for those who chose to partake at the rate of five shillings per head <\s>
<s> also refreshments of a superior class were here ready for the ladies and gentlemen of the county families who came to the ball but the commoner sort of persons were kept out of the room by a waiter who stood at the portal and who said that was a select room for lady clavering and lady rockminster's parties and not to be opened to the public till supper time which was not to be until past midnight <\s>
<s> pynsent who danced with his constituents daughters took them and their mammas in for their refreshment there <\s>
<s> strong who was manager and master of the revels wherever he went had of course the entree and the only person who was now occupying the room was the gentleman with the black wig and the orders in his button hole the officer in the service of his highness the nawaub of lucknow <\s>
<s> this gentleman had established himself very early in the evening in this apartment where saying he was confoundedly thirsty he called for a bottle of champagne <\s>
<s> at this order the waiter instantly supposed that he had to do with a grandee and the colonel sate down and began to eat his supper and absorb his drink and enter affably into conversation with anybody who entered the room <\s>
<s> sir francis clavering and mr <\s>
<s> wagg found him there when they left the ballroom which they did pretty early sir francis to go and smoke a cigar and look at the people gathered outside the ballroom on the shore which he declared was much better fun than to remain within mr <\s>
<s> wagg to hang on to a baronet's arm as he was always pleased to do on the arm of the greatest man in the company <\s>
<s> colonel altamont had stared at these gentlemen in so odd a manner as they passed through the select room that clavering made inquiries of the landlord who he was and hinted a strong opinion that the officer of the nawaub's service was drunk <\s>
<s> pynsent too had had the honour of a conversation with the servant of the indian potentate <\s>
<s> it was pynsent's cue to speak to everybody which he did to do him justice in the most ungracious manner ); and he took the gentleman in the black wig for some constituent some merchant captain or other outlandish man of the place <\s>
<s> pynsent then coming into the refreshment room with a lady the wife of a constituent on his arm the colonel asked him if he would try a glass of sham <\s>
<s> pynsent took it with great gravity bowed tasted the wine and pronounced it excellent and with the utmost politeness retreated before colonel altamont <\s>
<s> this gravity and decorum routed and surprised the colonel more than any other kind of behaviour probably would he stared after pynsent stupidly and pronounced to the landlord over the counter that he was a rum one <\s>
<s> rincer blushed and hardly knew what to say <\s>
<s> pynsent was a county earl's grandson going to set up as a parliament man <\s>
<s> colonel altamont on the other hand wore orders and diamonds jingled sovereigns constantly in his pocket and paid his way like a man so not knowing what to say mr <\s>
<s> rincer said yes colonel yes ma'am did you say tea <\s>
<s> cup a tea for mr <\s>
<s> r and so got off that discussion regarding mr <\s>
<s> pynsent's qualities into which the nizam's officer appeared inclined to enter <\s>
<s> in fact if the truth must be told mr <\s>
<s> altamont having remained at the buffet almost all night and employed himself very actively whilst there had considerably flushed his brain by drinking and he was still going on drinking when mr <\s>
<s> strong and miss amory entered the room <\s>
<s> when the chevalier ran out of the apartment attracted by the noise in the dancing room the colonel rose from his chair with his little red eyes glowing like coals and with rather an unsteady gait advanced towards blanche who was sipping her ice <\s>
<s> she was absorbed in absorbing it for it was very fresh and good or she was not curious to know what was going on in the adjoining room although the waiters were who ran after chevalier strong <\s>
<s> so that when she looked up from her glass she beheld this strange man staring at her out of his little red eyes <\s>
<s> it was quite exciting <\s>
<s> and so you're betsy amory said he after gazing at her <\s>
<s> betsy amory by jove <\s>
<s> who who speaks to me <\s>
<s> said betsy alias blanche <\s>
<s> but the noise in the ballroom is really becoming so loud that we must rush back thither and see what is the cause of the disturbance <\s>
<s> which is both quarrelsome and sentimental civil war was raging high words passing people pushing and squeezing together in an unseemly manner round a window in the corner of the ballroom close by the door through which the chevalier strong shouldered his way <\s>
<s> through the opened window the crowd in the street below was sending up sarcastic remarks such as pitch into him <\s>
<s> and the like and a ring of individuals amongst whom madame fribsby was conspicuous was gathered round monsieur alcide mirobolant on the one side whilst several gentlemen and ladies surrounded our friend arthur pendennis on the other <\s>
<s> strong penetrated into this assembly elbowing by madame fribsby who was charmed at the chevalier's appearance and cried save him save him <\s>
<s> in frantic and pathetic accents <\s>
<s> the cause of the disturbance it appeared was the angry little chef of sir francis clavering's culinary establishment <\s>
<s> shortly after strong had quitted the room and whilst mr <\s>
<s> pen greatly irate at his downfall in the waltz which had made him look ridiculous in the eyes of the nation and by miss amory's behaviour to him which had still further insulted his dignity was endeavouring to get some coolness of body and temper by looking out of window towards the sea which was sparkling in the distance and murmuring in a wonderful calm whilst he was really trying to compose himself and owning to himself perhaps that he had acted in a very absurd and peevish manner during the night he felt a hand upon his shoulder and on looking round beheld to his utter surprise and horror that the hand in question belonged to monsieur mirobolant whose eyes were glaring out of his pale face and ringlets at mr <\s>
<s> to be tapped on the shoulder by a french cook was a piece of familiarity which made the blood of the pendennises to boil up in the veins of their descendant and he was astounded almost more than enraged at such an indignity <\s>
<s> mirobolant said in his own language to pen <\s>
<s> what is that to you pray <\s>
<s> said pen in english <\s>
<s> at any rate you understand it <\s>
<s> continued the other with a bow <\s>
<s> yes sir said pen with a stamp of his foot i understand it pretty well <\s>
<s> vous me comprendrez alors monsieur pendennis replied the other rolling out his r with gascon force quand je vous dis que vous etes un lache <\s>
<s> monsieur pendennis un lache entendez vous <\s>
<s> said pen starting round on him <\s>
<s> you understand the meaning of the word and its consequences among men of honour <\s>
<s> the artist said putting his hand on his hip and staring at pen <\s>
<s> the consequences are that i will fling you out of window you impudent scoundrel bawled out mr <\s>
<s> pen and darting upon the frenchman he would very likely have put his threat into execution for the window was at hand and the artist by no means a match for the young gentleman had not captain broadfoot and another heavy officer flung themselves between the combatants had not the ladies begun to scream had not the fiddles stopped had not the crowd of people come running in that direction had not laura with a face of great alarm looked over their heads and asked for heaven's sake what was wrong had not the opportune strong made his appearance from the refreshment room and found alcides grinding his teeth and jabbering oaths in his galleon french and pen looking uncommonly wicked although trying to appear as calm as possible when the ladies and the crowd came up <\s>
<s> strong asked of the chef in spanish <\s>
<s> i am chevalier de juillet said the other slapping his breast and he has insulted me <\s>
<s> what has he said to you <\s>
<s> il m'a appele cuisinier hissed out the little frenchman <\s>
<s> strong could hardly help laughing <\s>
<s> come away with me poor chevalier he said <\s>
<s> we must not quarrel before ladies <\s>
<s> come away i will carry your message to mr <\s>
<s> pendennis the poor fellow is not right in his head he whispered to one or two people about him and others and anxious laura's face visible amongst these gathered round pen and asked the cause of the disturbance <\s>
<s> pen did not know <\s>
<s> the man was going to give his arm to a young lady on which i said that he was a cook and the man called me a coward and challenged me to fight <\s>
<s> i own i was so surprised and indignant that if you gentlemen had not stopped me i should have thrown him out of window pen said <\s>
<s> d him serve him right too the impudent foreign scoundrel the gentlemen said <\s>
<s> i i'm very sorry if i hurt his feelings though pen added and laura was glad to hear him say that although some of the young bucks said no hang the fellow hang those impudent foreigners little thrashing would do them good <\s>
<s> you will go and shake hands with him before you go to sleep won't you pen <\s>
<s> said laura coming up to him <\s>
<s> foreigners may be more susceptible than we are and have different manners <\s>
<s> if you hurt a poor man's feelings i am sure you would be the first to ask his pardon <\s>
<s> wouldn't you dear pen <\s>
<s> she looked all forgiveness and gentleness like an angel as she spoke and pen took both her hands and looked into her kind face and said indeed he would <\s>
<s> how fond that girl is of me <\s>
<s> he thought as she stood gazing at him <\s>
<s> shall i speak to her now <\s>
<s> i must have this absurd business with the frenchman over <\s>
<s> laura asked wouldn't he stop and dance with her <\s>
<s> she was as anxious to keep him in the room as he to quit it <\s>
<s> won't you stop and waltz with me pen <\s>
<s> i'm not afraid to waltz with you <\s>
<s> this was an affectionate but an unlucky speech <\s>
<s> pen saw himself prostrate on the ground having tumbled over miss roundle and the dragoon and flung blanche up against the wall saw himself on the ground and all the people laughing at him laura and pynsent amongst them <\s>
