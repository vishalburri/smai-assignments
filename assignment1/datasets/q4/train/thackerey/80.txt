<s> costigan in his most intoxicated and confidential moments also evaded any replies to questions or hints addressed to him on this subject there was no particular secret about it as we have seen who have had more than once the honour of entering his apartments but in the vicissitudes of a long life he had been pretty often in the habit of residing in houses where privacy was necessary to his comfort and where the appearance of some visitors would have brought him anything but pleasure <\s>
<s> hence all sorts of legends were formed by wags or credulous persons respecting his place of abode <\s>
<s> it was stated that he slept habitually in a watch box in the city in a cab at a mews where a cab proprietor gave him a shelter in the duke of york's column etc the wildest of these theories being put abroad by the facetious and imaginative huxter <\s>
<s> for huxey when not silenced by the company of swells and when in the society of his own friends was a very different fellow to the youth whom we have seen cowed by pen's impertinent airs and adored by his family at home was the life and soul of the circle whom he met either round the festive board or the dissecting table <\s>
<s> on one brilliant september morning as huxter was regaling himself with a cup of coffee at a stall in covent garden having spent a delicious night dancing at vauxhall he spied the general reeling down henrietta street with a crowd of hooting blackguard boys at his heels who had left their beds under the arches of the river betimes and were prowling about already for breakfast and the strange livelihood of the day <\s>
<s> the poor old general was not in that condition when the sneers and jokes of these young beggars had much effect upon him the cabmen and watermen at the cabstand knew him and passed their comments upon him the policemen gazed after him and warned the boys off him with looks of scorn and pity what did the scorn and pity of men the jokes of ribald children matter to the general <\s>
<s> he reeled along the street with glazed eyes having just sense enough to know whither he was bound and to pursue his accustomed beat homewards <\s>
<s> he went to bed not knowing how he had reached it as often as any man in london <\s>
<s> he woke and found himself there and asked no questions and he was tacking about on this daily though perilous voyage when from his station at the coffee stall huxter spied him <\s>
<s> to note his friend to pay his twopence indeed he had but eightpence left or he would have had a cab from vauxhall to take him home was with the eager huxter the work of an instant costigan dived down the alleys by drury lane theatre where gin shops oyster shops and theatrical wardrobes abound the proprietors of which were now asleep behind their shutters as the pink morning lighted up their chimneys and through these courts huxter followed the general until he reached oldcastle street in which is the gate of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> here just as he was within sight of home a luckless slice of orange peel came between the general's heel and the pavement and caused the poor old fellow to fall backwards <\s>
<s> huxter ran up to him instantly and after a pause during which the veteran giddy with his fall and his previous whisky gathered as he best might his dizzy brains together the young surgeon lifted up the limping general and very kindly and good naturedly offered to conduct him to his home <\s>
<s> for some time and in reply to the queries which the student of medicine put to him the muzzy general refused to say where his lodgings were and declared that they were hard by and that he could reach them without difficulty and he disengaged himself from huxter's arm and made a rush as if to get to his own home unattended but he reeled and lurched so that the young surgeon insisted upon accompanying him and with many soothing expressions and cheering and consolatory phrases succeeded in getting the general's dirty old hand under what he called his own fin and led the old fellow moaning piteously across the street <\s>
<s> he stopped when he came to the ancient gate ornamented with the armorial bearings of the venerable shepherd <\s>
<s> here tis said he drawing up at the portal and he made a successful pull at the gate bell which presently brought out old mr <\s>
<s> bolton the porter scowling fiercely and grumbling as he was used to do every morning when it became his turn to let in that early bird <\s>
<s> costigan tried to hold bolton for a moment in genteel conversation but the other surlily would not <\s>
<s> don't bother me said he go to your hown bed capting and don't keep honest men out of theirs <\s>
<s> so the captain tacked across the square and reached his own staircase up which he stumbled with the worthy huxter at his heels <\s>
<s> costigan had a key of his own which huxter inserted into the keyhole for him so that there was no need to call up little mr <\s>
<s> bows from the sleep into which the old musician had not long since fallen and huxter having aided to disrobe his tipsy patient and ascertained that no bones were broken helped him to bed and applied compresses an water to one of his knees and shins which with the pair of trousers which encased them costigan had severely torn in his fall <\s>
<s> at the general's age and with his habit of body such wounds as he had inflicted on himself are slow to heal a good deal of inflammation ensued and the old fellow lay ill for some days suffering both pain and fever <\s>
<s> huxter undertook the case of his interesting patient with great confidence and alacrity and conducted it with becoming skill <\s>
<s> he visited his friend day after day and consoled him with lively rattle and conversation for the absence of the society which costigan needed and of which he was an ornament and he gave special instructions to the invalid's nurse about the quantity of whisky which the patient was to take instructions which as the poor old fellow could not for many days get out of his bed or sofa himself he could not by any means infringe <\s>
<s> bolton and our little friend fanny when able to do so officiated at the general's bedside and the old warrior was made as comfortable as possible under his calamity <\s>
<s> thus huxter whose affable manners and social turn made him quickly intimate with persons in whose society he fell and whose over refinement did not lead them to repulse the familiarities of this young gentleman became pretty soon intimate in shepherd's inn both with our acquaintances in the garrets and those in the porter's lodge <\s>
<s> he thought he had seen fanny somewhere he felt certain that he had but it is no wonder that he should not accurately remember her for the poor little thing never chose to tell him where she had met him he himself had seen her at a period when his own views both of persons and of right and wrong were clouded by the excitement of drinking and dancing and also little fanny was very much changed and worn by the fever and agitation and passion and despair which the past three weeks had poured upon the head of that little victim <\s>
<s> borne down was the head now and very pale and wan the face and many and many a time the sad eyes had looked into the postman's as he came to the inn and the sickened heart had sunk as he passed away <\s>
<s> costigan's accident occurred fanny was rather glad to have an opportunity of being useful and doing something kind something that would make her forget her own little sorrows perhaps she felt she bore them better whilst she did her duty though i dare say many a tear dropped into the old irishman's gruel <\s>
<s> stir the gruel well and have courage little fanny <\s>
<s> if everybody who has suffered from your complaint were to die of it straightway what a fine year the undertakers would have <\s>
<s> whether from compassion for his only patient or delight in his society mr <\s>
<s> huxter found now occasion to visit costigan two or three times in the day at least and if any of the members of the porter's lodge family were not in attendance on the general the young doctor was sure to have some particular directions to address to those at their own place of habitation <\s>
<s> he was a kind fellow he made or purchased toys for the children he brought them apples and brandy balls he brought a mask and frightened them with it and caused a smile upon the face of pale fanny <\s>
<s> b and was very intimate familiar and facetious with that lady quite different from that aughty artless beast as mrs <\s>
<s> bolton now denominated a certain young gentleman of our acquaintance and whom she now vowed she never could abear <\s>
<s> it was from this lady who was very free in her conversation that huxter presently learnt what was the illness which was evidently preying upon little fan and what had been pen's behaviour regarding her <\s>
<s> bolton's account of the transaction was not it may be imagined entirely an impartial narrative <\s>
<s> one would have thought from her story that the young gentleman had employed a course of the most persevering and flagitious artifices to win the girl's heart had broken the most solemn promises made to her and was a wretch to be hated and chastised by every champion of woman <\s>
<s> huxter in his present frame of mind respecting arthur and suffering under the latter's contumely was ready of course to take all for granted that was said in the disfavour of this unfortunate convalescent <\s>
<s> but why did he not write home to clavering as he had done previously giving an account of pen's misconduct and of the particulars regarding it which had now come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> he soon in a letter to his brother in law announced that that nice young man mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had escaped narrowly from a fever and that no doubt all clavering where he was so popular would be pleased at his recovery and he mentioned that he had an interesting case of compound fracture an officer of distinction which kept him in town but as for fanny bolton he made no more mention of her in his letters no more than pen himself had made mention of her <\s>
<s> o you mothers at home how much do you think you know about your lads <\s>
<s> how much do you think you know <\s>
<s> but with bows there was no reason why huxter should not speak his mind and so a very short time after his conversation with mrs <\s>
<s> sam talked to the musician about his early acquaintance with pendennis described him as a confounded conceited blackguard and expressed a determination to punch his impudent head as soon as ever he should be well enough to stand up like a man <\s>
<s> then it was that bows on his part spoke and told his version of the story whereof arthur and little fan were the hero and heroine how they had met by no contrivance of the former but by a blunder of the old irishman now in bed with a broken shin how pen had acted with manliness and self control in the business how mrs bolton was an idiot and he related the conversation which he bows had had with pen and the sentiments uttered by the young man <\s>
<s> perhaps bow's story caused some twinges of conscience in the breast of pen's accuser and that gentleman frankly owned that he had been wrong with regard to arthur and withdrew his project for punching mr <\s>
<s> but the cessation of his hostility for pen did not diminish huxter's attentions to fanny which unlucky mr bows marked with his usual jealousy and bitterness of spirit i have but to like anybody the old fellow thought and somebody is sure to come and be preferred to me <\s>
<s> it has been the same ill luck with me since i was a lad until now that i am sixty years old <\s>
<s> what can such a man as i am expect better than to be laughed at <\s>
<s> it is for the young to succeed and to be happy and not for old fools like me <\s>
<s> i've played a second fiddle through life he said with a bitter laugh how can i suppose the luck is to change after it has gone against me so long <\s>
<s> this was the selfish way in which bows looked at the state of affairs though few persons would have thought there was any cause for his jealousy who looked at the pale and grief stricken countenance of the hapless little girl its object <\s>
<s> fanny received huxter's good natured efforts at consolation and kind attentions kindly <\s>
<s> she laughed now and again at his jokes and games with her little sisters but relapsed quickly into a dejection which ought to have satisfied mr <\s>
<s> bows that the new comer had no place in her heart as yet had jealous mr <\s>
<s> bows been enabled to see with clear eyes <\s>
<s> but bows did not <\s>
<s> fanny attributed pen's silence somehow to bows's interference <\s>
<s> fanny treated bows with constant cruelty and injustice <\s>
<s> she turned from him when he spoke she loathed his attempts at consolation <\s>
<s> a hard life had mr <\s>
<s> bows and a cruel return for his regard <\s>
<s> when warrington came to shepherd's inn as pen's ambassador it was for mr <\s>
<s> bows's apartments he inquired no doubt upon a previous agreement with the principal for whom he acted in this delicate negotiation and he did not so much as catch a glimpse of miss fanny when he stopped at the inn gate and made his inquiry <\s>
<s> warrington was of course directed to the musician's chambers and found him tending the patient there from whose chamber he came out to wait upon his guest <\s>
<s> we have said that they had been previously known to one another and the pair shook hands with sufficient cordiality <\s>
<s> after a little preliminary talk warrington said that he had come from his friend arthur pendennis and from his family to thank bows for his attention at the commencement of pen's illness and for his kindness in hastening into the country to fetch the major <\s>
<s> bows replied that it was but his duty he had never thought to have seen the young gentleman alive again when he went in search of pen's relatives and he was very glad of mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's recovery and that he had his friends with him <\s>
<s> lucky are they who have friends mr <\s>
<s> warrington said the musician <\s>
<s> i might be up in this garret and nobody would care for me or mind whether i was alive or dead <\s>
<s> not the general mr <\s>
<s> the general likes his whisky bottle more than anything in life the other answered we live together from habit and convenience and he cares for me no more than you do <\s>
<s> what is it you want to ask me mr <\s>
<s> you ain't come to visit me i know very well <\s>
<s> nobody comes to visit me <\s>
<s> it is about fanny the porter's daughter you are come i see that very well <\s>
<s> pendennis now he has got well anxious to see her again <\s>
<s> does his lordship the sultan propose to throw his andkerchief to her <\s>
<s> she has been very ill sir ever since the day when mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis turned her out of doors kind of a lady wasn't it <\s>
<s> the poor girl and myself found the young gentleman raving in a fever knowing nobody with nobody to tend him but his drunken laundress she watched day and night by him <\s>
