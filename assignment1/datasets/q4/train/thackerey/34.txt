<s> thus it will be seen from the above report of this candid conversation that our accomplished little friend had some peculiarities or defects of character which rendered her not very popular <\s>
<s> she was a young lady of some genius exquisite sympathies and considerable literary attainments living like many another genius with relatives who could not comprehend her <\s>
<s> neither her mother nor her stepfather were persons of a literary turn <\s>
<s> bell's life and the racing calendar were the extent of the baronet's reading and lady clavering still wrote like a schoolgirl of thirteen and with an extraordinary disregard to grammar and spelling <\s>
<s> and as miss amory felt very keenly that she was not appreciated and that she lived with persons who were not her equals in intellect or conversational power she lost no opportunity to acquaint her family circle with their inferiority to herself and not only was a martyr but took care to let everybody know that she was so <\s>
<s> if she suffered as she said and thought she did severely are we to wonder that a young creature of such delicate sensibilities should shriek and cry out a good deal <\s>
<s> without sympathy life is nothing and would it not have been a want of candour on her part to affect a cheerfulness which she did not feel or pretend a respect for those towards whom it was quite impossible she should entertain any reverence <\s>
<s> if a poetess may not bemoan her lot of what earthly use is her lyre <\s>
<s> blanche struck hers only to the saddest of tunes and sang elegies over her dead hopes dirges over her early frost nipt buds of affection as became such a melancholy fate and muse <\s>
<s> her actual distresses as we have said had not been up to the present time very considerable but her griefs lay like those of most of us in her own soul that being sad and habitually dissatisfied what wonder that she should weep <\s>
<s> so mes larmes dribbled out of her eyes any day at command she could furnish an unlimited supply of tears and her faculty of shedding them increased by practice <\s>
<s> for sentiment is like another complaint mentioned by horace as increasing by self indulgence i am sorry to say ladies that the complaint in question is called the dropsy and the more you cry the more you will be able and desirous to do so <\s>

<s> i wouldn't take her at twice the figure captain strong said laughing <\s>
<s> i never saw such a little devil in my life <\s>
<s> i should like to poison her said the sententious baronet by jove i should <\s>
<s> why what has she been at now <\s>
<s> nothing particular answered sir francis only her old tricks <\s>
<s> that girl has such a knack of making everybody miserable that hang me it's quite surprising <\s>
<s> last night she sent the governess crying away from the dinner table <\s>
<s> afterwards as i was passing frank's room i heard the poor little beggar howling in the dark and found his sister had been frightening his soul out of his body by telling him stories about the ghost that's in the house <\s>
<s> at lunch she gave my lady a turn and though my wife's a fool she's a good soul i'm hanged if she ain't <\s>
<s> what did missy do to her <\s>
<s> why hang me if she didn't begin talking about the late amory my predecessor the baronet said with a grin <\s>
<s> she got some picture out of the keepsake and said she was sure it was like her dear father she wanted to know where her father's grave was <\s>
<s> whenever miss amory talks about him lady clavering always bursts out crying and the little devil will talk about him in order to spite her mother <\s>
<s> today when she began i got in a confounded rage said i was her father and and that sort of thing and then sir she took a shy at me <\s>
<s> and what did she say about you frank <\s>
<s> strong still laughing inquired of his friend and patron <\s>
<s> gad she said i wasn't her father that i wasn't fit to comprehend her that her father must have been a man of genius and fine feelings and that sort of thing whereas i had married her mother for money <\s>
<s> it don't make it any the pleasanter to hear because it's true don't you know sir francis clavering answered <\s>
<s> i ain't a literary man and that but i ain't such a fool as she makes me out <\s>
<s> i don't know how it is but she always manages to put me in the hole don't you understand <\s>
<s> she turns all the house round her in her quiet way and with her confounded sentimental airs <\s>
<s> i wish she was dead ned <\s>
<s> it was my wife whom you wanted dead just now strong said always in perfect good humour upon which the baron with his accustomed candour said well when people bore my life out i do wish they were dead and i wish missy were down a well with all my heart <\s>
<s> thus it will be seen from the above report of this candid conversation that our accomplished little friend had some peculiarities or defects of character which rendered her not very popular <\s>
<s> she was a young lady of some genius exquisite sympathies and considerable literary attainments living like many another genius with relatives who could not comprehend her <\s>
<s> neither her mother nor her stepfather were persons of a literary turn <\s>
<s> bell's life and the racing calendar were the extent of the baronet's reading and lady clavering still wrote like a schoolgirl of thirteen and with an extraordinary disregard to grammar and spelling <\s>
<s> and as miss amory felt very keenly that she was not appreciated and that she lived with persons who were not her equals in intellect or conversational power she lost no opportunity to acquaint her family circle with their inferiority to herself and not only was a martyr but took care to let everybody know that she was so <\s>
<s> if she suffered as she said and thought she did severely are we to wonder that a young creature of such delicate sensibilities should shriek and cry out a good deal <\s>
<s> without sympathy life is nothing and would it not have been a want of candour on her part to affect a cheerfulness which she did not feel or pretend a respect for those towards whom it was quite impossible she should entertain any reverence <\s>
<s> if a poetess may not bemoan her lot of what earthly use is her lyre <\s>
<s> blanche struck hers only to the saddest of tunes and sang elegies over her dead hopes dirges over her early frost nipt buds of affection as became such a melancholy fate and muse <\s>
<s> her actual distresses as we have said had not been up to the present time very considerable but her griefs lay like those of most of us in her own soul that being sad and habitually dissatisfied what wonder that she should weep <\s>
<s> so mes larmes dribbled out of her eyes any day at command she could furnish an unlimited supply of tears and her faculty of shedding them increased by practice <\s>
<s> for sentiment is like another complaint mentioned by horace as increasing by self indulgence i am sorry to say ladies that the complaint in question is called the dropsy and the more you cry the more you will be able and desirous to do so <\s>
<s> missy had begun to gush at a very early age <\s>
<s> lamartine was her favourite bard from the period when she first could feel and she had subsequently improved her mind by a sedulous study of novels of the great modern authors of the french language <\s>
<s> there was not a romance of balzac and george sand which the indefatigable little creature had not devoured by the time she was sixteen and however little she sympathised with her relatives at home she had friends as she said in the spirit world meaning the tender indiana the passionate and poetic lelia the amiable trenmor that high souled convict that angel of the galleys the fiery stenio and the other numberless heroes of the french romances <\s>
<s> she had been in love with prince rodolph and prince djalma while she was yet at school and had settled the divorce question and the rights of woman with indiana before she had left off pinafores <\s>
<s> the impetuous little lady played at love with these imaginary worthies as a little while before she had played at maternity with her doll <\s>
<s> pretty little poetical spirits <\s>
<s> it is curious to watch them with those playthings <\s>
<s> to day the blue eyed one is the favourite and the black eyed one is pushed behind the drawers <\s>
<s> to morrow blue eyes may take its turn of neglect and it may be an odious little wretch with a burnt nose or torn bead of hair and no eyes at all that takes the first place in miss's affection and is dandled and caressed in her arms <\s>
<s> as novelists are supposed to know everything even the secrets of female hearts which the owners themselves do not perhaps know we may state that at eleven years of age mademoiselle betsi as miss amory was then called had felt tender emotions towards a young savoyard organ grinder at paris whom she persisted in believing to be a prince carried off from his parents that at twelve an old and hideous drawing master but ah what age or personal defects are proof against woman's love had agitated her young heart and that at thirteen being at madame de caramel's boarding school in the champs elysees which as everybody knows is next door to monsieur rogron's chevalier of the legion of honour pension for young gentlemen a correspondence by letter took place between the seduisante miss betsi and two young gentlemen of the college of charlemagne who were pensioners of the chevalier rogron <\s>
<s> in the above paragraph our young friend has been called by a christian name different to that under which we were lately presented to her <\s>
<s> the fact is that miss amory called missy at home had really at the first been christened betsy but assumed the name of blanche of her own will and fantasy and crowned herself with it and the weapon which the baronet her stepfather held in terror over her was the threat to call her publicly by her name of betsy by which menace he sometimes managed to keep the young rebel in order <\s>
<s> we have spoken just now of children's dolls and of the manner in which those little people take up and neglect their darling toys and very likely this history will show that miss blanche assumed and put away her live dolls with a similar girlish inconstancy <\s>
<s> she had had hosts of dear dear darling friends ere now and had quite a little museum of locks of hair in her treasure chest which she had gathered in the course of her sentimental progress <\s>
<s> some dear friends had married some had gone to other schools one beloved sister she had lost from the pension and found again o horror <\s>
<s> her darling her leocadie keeping the books in her father's shop a grocer in the rue du bac in fact she had met with a number of disappointments estrangements disillusionments as she called them in her pretty french jargon and had seen and suffered a great deal for so young a woman <\s>
<s> but it is the lot of sensibility to suffer and of confiding tenderness to be deceived and she felt that she was only undergoing the penalties of genius in these pangs and disappointments of her young career <\s>
<s> meanwhile she managed to make the honest lady her mother as uncomfortable as circumstances would permit and caused her worthy stepfather to wish she was dead <\s>
<s> with the exception of captain strong whose invincible good humour was proof against her sarcasms the little lady ruled the whole house with he tongue <\s>
<s> if lady clavering talked about sparrowgrass instead of asparagus or called an object a hobject as this unfortunate lady would sometimes do missy calmly corrected her and frightened the good soul her mother into errors only the more frequent as she grew more nervous under her daughter's eye <\s>
