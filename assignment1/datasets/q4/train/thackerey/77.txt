<s> it is not only for the sick man it is for the sick man's friends that the doctor comes <\s>

<s> what an emotion the thrill of his carriage wheels in the street and at length at the door has made us feel <\s>
<s> how we hang upon his words and what a comfort we get from a smile or two if he can vouchsafe that sunshine to lighten our darkness <\s>

<s> having passed through a hasty ceremony of introduction to the new comers of whose arrival he had been made aware by the heartbroken little nurse in waiting without the doctor proceeded to examine the patient about whose condition of high fever there could be no mistake and on whom he thought it necessary to exercise the strongest antiphlogistic remedies in his power <\s>
<s> he consoled the unfortunate mother as best he might and giving her the most comfortable assurances on which he could venture that there was no reason to despair yet that everything might still be hoped from his youth the strength of his constitution and so forth and having done his utmost to allay the horrors of the alarmed matron he took the elder pendennis aside into the vacant room warrington's bedroom for the purpose of holding a little consultation <\s>
<s> the case was very critical <\s>

<s> i just caught a glimpse of her as we passed in the major said and begad she was uncommonly nice looking <\s>
<s> the doctor looked queer the doctor smiled in the very gravest moments with life and death pending such strange contrasts and occasions of humour will arise and such smiles will pass to satirise the gloom as it were and to make it more gloomy <\s>
<s> i have it at last he said re entering the study and he wrote a couple of notes hastily at the table there and sealed one of them <\s>
<s> then taking up poor fanny's shawl and bonnet and the notes he went out in the passage to that poor little messenger and said quick nurse you must carry this to the surgeon and bid him come instantly and then go to my house and ask for my servant harbottle and tell him to get this prescription prepared and wait until i until it is ready <\s>
<s> it may take a little in preparation <\s>
<s> so poor fanny trudged away with her two notes and found the apothecary who lived in the strand hard by and who came straightway his lancet in his pocket to operate on his patient and then fanny made for the doctor's house in hanover square <\s>
<s> the doctor was at home again before the prescription was made up which took harbottle his servant such a long time in compounding and during the remainder of arthur's illness poor fanny never made her appearance in the quality of nurse at his chambers any more <\s>
<s> but for that day and the next a little figure might be seen lurking about pen's staircase a sad sad little face looked at and interrogated the apothecary and the apothecary's boy and the laundress and the kind physician himself as they passed out of the chambers of the sick man <\s>
<s> and on the third day the kind doctor's chariot stopped at shepherd's inn and the good and honest and benevolent man went into the porter's lodge and tended a little patient whom he had there for the best remedy he found was on the day when he was enabled to tell fanny bolton that the crisis was over and that there was at length every hope for arthur pendennis <\s>

<s> the widow's gratitude to the physician knew no bounds or scarcely any bounds at least <\s>
<s> the kind gentleman laughed at the idea of taking a fee from a literary man or the widow of a brother practitioner and she determined when she got to fairoaks that she would send goodenough the silver gilt vase the jewel of the house and the glory of the late john pendennis preserved in green baize and presented to him at bath by the lady elizabeth firebrace on the recovery of her son the late sir anthony firebrace from the scarlet fever <\s>
