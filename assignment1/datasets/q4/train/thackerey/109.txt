<s> all this while a strange feeling of exultation had taken possession of blanche's mind <\s>
<s> that month with poor harry had been a weary month to her <\s>
<s> all his fortune and splendour scarcely sufficed to make the idea of himself supportable <\s>
<s> she was wearied of his simple ways and sick of coaxing and cajoling him <\s>

<s> i'm a magistrate and dammy i'll commit him <\s>
<s> here's a chaise coming perhaps it's him <\s>
