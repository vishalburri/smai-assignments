<s> wenham who would have starved rather than have come to dinner in an omnibus but i don't think that she need flourish the straw about do you mr <\s>
<s> my dear miss bunion how do you do <\s>
<s> i was in a great lady's drawing room this morning and everybody was charmed with your new volume <\s>
<s> those lines on the christening of lady fanny fantail brought tears into the duchess's eyes <\s>
<s> i said that i thought i should have the pleasure of meeting you to day and she begged me to thank you and say how greatly she was pleased <\s>
<s> this history told in a bland smiling manner of a duchess whom wenham had met that very morning too quite put poor wagg's dowager and baronet out of court and placed wenham beyond wagg as a man of fashion <\s>
<s> wenham kept this inestimable advantage and having the conversation to himself ran on with a number of anecdotes regarding the aristocracy <\s>

<s> house the other night when the duke said so and so but mr <\s>
<s> popjoy would not gratify him by joining in the talk preferring to fall back into the window recess with mrs <\s>
<s> bungay and watch the cabs that drove up to the opposite door <\s>
<s> at least if he would not talk the hostess hoped that those odious bacons would see how she had secured the noble percy popjoy for her party <\s>
<s> and now the bell of saint paul's tolled half an hour later than that for which mr <\s>
<s> bungay had invited his party and it was complete with the exception of two guests who at last made their appearance and in whom pen was pleased to recognise captain and mrs <\s>
<s> when these two had made their greetings to the master and mistress of the house and exchanged nods of more or less recognition with most of the people present pen and warrington went up and shook hands very warmly with mrs <\s>
<s> shandon who perhaps was affected to meet them and think where it was she had seen them but a few days before <\s>
<s> shandon was brushed up and looked pretty smart in a red velvet waistcoat and a frill into which his wife had stuck her best brooch <\s>
<s> in spite of mrs <\s>
<s> bungay's kindness perhaps in consequence of it mrs <\s>
<s> shandon felt great terror and timidity in approaching her indeed she was more awful than ever in her red satin and bird of paradise and it was not until she had asked in her great voice about the dear little gurl that the latter was somewhat encouraged and ventured to speak <\s>
<s> nice looking woman popjoy whispered to warrington <\s>
<s> do introduce me to captain shandon warrington <\s>
<s> i'm told he's a tremendous clever fellow and dammy i adore intellect by jove i do <\s>
<s> this was the truth heaven had not endowed young mr <\s>
<s> popjoy with much intellect of his own but had given him a generous faculty for admiring if not for appreciating the intellect of others <\s>
<s> and introduce me to miss bunion <\s>
<s> i'm told she's very clever too <\s>
<s> she's rum to look at certainly but that don't matter <\s>
<s> dammy i consider myself a literary man and i wish to know all the clever fellows <\s>
<s> shandon had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with one another and now the doors of the adjoining dining room being flung open the party entered and took their seats at table <\s>
<s> pen found himself next to bunion on one side and to mr <\s>
<s> wagg the truth is wagg fled alarmed from the vacant place by the poetess and pen was compelled to take it <\s>
<s> the gifted being did not talk much during dinner but pen remarked that she ate with a vast appetite and never refused any of the supplies of wine which were offered to her by the butler <\s>
<s> indeed miss bunion having considered mr <\s>
<s> pendennis for a minute who gave himself rather grand airs and who was attired in an extremely fashionable style with his very best chains shirt studs and cambric fronts he was set down and not without reason as a prig by the poetess who thought it was much better to attend to her dinner than to take any notice of him <\s>
<s> she told him as much in after days with her usual candour <\s>
<s> i took you for one of the little mayfair dandies she said to pen <\s>
<s> you looked as solemn as a little undertaker and as i disliked beyond measure the odious creature who was on the other side of me i thought it was best to eat my dinner and hold my tongue <\s>
<s> and you did both very well my dear miss bunion pen said with a laugh <\s>
<s> well so i do but i intend to talk to you the next time a great deal for you are neither so solemn nor so stupid nor so pert as you look <\s>
<s> ah miss bunion how i pine for that next time to come pen said with an air of comical gallantry but we must return to the day and the dinner at paternoster row <\s>
<s> the repast was of the richest description what i call of the florid gothic style wagg whispered to penn who sate beside the humourist in his side wing voice <\s>
<s> the men in creaking shoes and berlin gloves were numerous and solemn carrying on rapid conversations behind the guests as they moved to and fro with the dishes <\s>
<s> doolan called out waither to one of them and blushed when he thought of his blunder <\s>
<s> bungay's footboy was lost amidst those large and black coated attendants <\s>
<s> look at that very bow windowed man wagg said <\s>
<s> he's an undertaker in amen corner and attends funerals and dinners <\s>
<s> cold meat and hot don't you perceive <\s>
<s> he's the sham butler here and i observe my dear mr <\s>
<s> pendennis as you will through life that wherever there is a sham butler at a london dinner there is sham wine this sherry is filthy <\s>
<s> bungay my boy where did you get this delicious brown sherry <\s>
<s> i'm glad you like it mr <\s>
<s> wagg glass with you said the publisher <\s>
<s> it's some i got from alderman benning's store and gave a good figure for it i can tell you <\s>
<s> pendennis will you join us <\s>
<s> the old rogue where does he expect to go to <\s>
<s> it came from the public house wagg said <\s>
<s> it requires two men to carry off that sherry tis so uncommonly strong <\s>
