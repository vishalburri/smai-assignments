<s> do you mean to say he asked that we are to praise no books that bacon publishes or that if the books are good we are to say they are bad <\s>
<s> my good young friend for what do you suppose a benevolent publisher undertakes a critical journal to benefit his rival <\s>
<s> to benefit himself certainly but to tell the truth too pen said ruat coelum to tell the truth <\s>
<s> and my prospectus said shandon with a laugh and a sner do you consider that was a work of mathematical accuracy of statement <\s>
<s> pardon me that is not the question pen said and i don't think you very much care to argue it <\s>
<s> i had some qualms of conscience about that same prospectus and debated the matter with my friend warrington <\s>
<s> we agreed however pen said laughing that because the prospectus was rather declamatory and poetical and the giant was painted upon the show board rather larger than the original who was inside the caravan we need not be too scrupulous about this trifling inaccuracy but might do our part of the show without loss of character or remorse of conscience <\s>
<s> we are the fiddlers and play our tunes only you are the showman <\s>
<s> and leader of the van said shandon <\s>
<s> well i am glad that your conscience gave you leave to play for us <\s>
<s> yes but said pen with a fine sense of the dignity of his position we are all party men in england and i will stick to my party like a briton <\s>
<s> there's no such thing in the whole book whispered wagg to pen <\s>
<s> it wouldn't be a bad plot for a high church novel <\s>
<s> i remember poor byron hobhouse trelawney and myself dining with cardinal mezzocaldo at rome captain sumph began and we had some orvieto wine for dinner which byron liked very much <\s>
<s> and i remember how the cardinal regretted that he was a single man <\s>

<s> a devilish interesting story sumph indeed wagg said <\s>

<s> when the ladies retired from the table the talk grew louder still and presently wenham in a courtly speech proposed that everybody should drink to the health of the new journal eulogising highly the talents wit and learning of its editor captain shandon <\s>

<s> do you mean to say he asked that we are to praise no books that bacon publishes or that if the books are good we are to say they are bad <\s>
<s> my good young friend for what do you suppose a benevolent publisher undertakes a critical journal to benefit his rival <\s>
<s> to benefit himself certainly but to tell the truth too pen said ruat coelum to tell the truth <\s>
<s> and my prospectus said shandon with a laugh and a sner do you consider that was a work of mathematical accuracy of statement <\s>
<s> pardon me that is not the question pen said and i don't think you very much care to argue it <\s>
<s> i had some qualms of conscience about that same prospectus and debated the matter with my friend warrington <\s>
<s> we agreed however pen said laughing that because the prospectus was rather declamatory and poetical and the giant was painted upon the show board rather larger than the original who was inside the caravan we need not be too scrupulous about this trifling inaccuracy but might do our part of the show without loss of character or remorse of conscience <\s>
<s> we are the fiddlers and play our tunes only you are the showman <\s>
<s> and leader of the van said shandon <\s>
<s> well i am glad that your conscience gave you leave to play for us <\s>
<s> yes but said pen with a fine sense of the dignity of his position we are all party men in england and i will stick to my party like a briton <\s>
<s> there's no such thing in the whole book whispered wagg to pen <\s>
<s> it wouldn't be a bad plot for a high church novel <\s>
<s> i remember poor byron hobhouse trelawney and myself dining with cardinal mezzocaldo at rome captain sumph began and we had some orvieto wine for dinner which byron liked very much <\s>
<s> and i remember how the cardinal regretted that he was a single man <\s>

<s> a devilish interesting story sumph indeed wagg said <\s>

<s> when the ladies retired from the table the talk grew louder still and presently wenham in a courtly speech proposed that everybody should drink to the health of the new journal eulogising highly the talents wit and learning of its editor captain shandon <\s>
