<s> the carriage took its fair owners to madame rigodon's cap and lace shop to mrs wolsey's berlin worsted shop who knows to what other resorts of female commerce <\s>
<s> then it went and took ices at hunter's for lady clavering was somewhat florid in her tastes and amusements and not only liked to go abroad in the most showy carriage in london but that the public should see her in it too <\s>
<s> and so in a white bonnet with a yellow feather she ate a large pink ice in the sunshine before hunter's door till foker on his pony and the red jacket who accompanied him were almost tired of dodging <\s>
<s> then at last she made her way into the park and the rapid foker made his dash forward <\s>
<s> just to get a nod of recognition from miss amory and her mother to cross them a half dozen times in the drive to watch and ogle them from the other side of the ditch where the horsemen assemble when the band plays in kensington gardens <\s>
<s> what is the use of looking at a woman in a pink bonnet across a ditch <\s>
<s> what is the earthly good to be got out of a nod of the head <\s>
<s> strange that men will be contented with such pleasures or if not contented at least that they will be so eager in seeking them <\s>
<s> not one word did harry he so fluent of conversation ordinarily change with his charmer on that day <\s>
<s> mutely he beheld her return to her carriage and drive away among rather ironical salutes from the young men in the park <\s>
<s> one said that the indian widow was making the paternal rupees spin rapidly another said that she ought to have burned herself alive and left the money to her daughter <\s>
<s> this one asked who clavering was and old tom eales who knew everybody and never missed a day in the park on his grey cob kindly said that clavering had come into an estate over head and heels in mortgage that there were dev'lish ugly stories about him when he was a young man and that it was reported of him that he had a share in a gambling house and had certainly shown the white feather in his regiment <\s>
<s> he plays still he is in a hell every night almost mr <\s>
<s> i should think so since his marriage said a wag <\s>
<s> he gives devilish good dinners said foker striking up for the honour of his host of yesterday <\s>
<s> i daresay and i daresay he doesn't ask eales the wag said <\s>
<s> i say eales do you dine at clavering's at the begum's <\s>
<s> eales who would have dined with beelzebub if sure of a good cook and when he came away would have painted his host blacker than fate had made him <\s>
<s> you might you know although you do abuse him so continued the wag <\s>
<s> they say it's very pleasant <\s>
<s> clavering goes to sleep after dinner the begum gets tipsy with cherry brandy and the young lady sings songs to the young gentlemen <\s>
<s> she sings well don't she fo <\s>
<s> slap up said fo <\s>
<s> i tell you what poyntz she sings like a whatdyecallum you know what i mean like a mermaid you know but that's not their name <\s>
<s> i never heard a mermaid sing mr <\s>
<s> poyntz the wag replied <\s>
<s> whoever heard a mermaid <\s>
<s> eales you are an old fellow did you <\s>
<s> don't make a lark of me hang it poyntz said foker turning red and with tears almost in his eyes you know what i mean it's those what's his names in homer you know <\s>
<s> i never said i was a good scholar <\s>
<s> and nobody ever said it of you my boy mr <\s>
<s> poyntz remarked and foker striking spurs into his pony cantered away down rotten row his mind agitated with various emotions ambitions mortifications <\s>
<s> he was sorry that he had not been good at his books in early life that he might have cut out all those chaps who were about her and who talked the languages and wrote poetry and painted pictures in her album and and that what am i thought little foker compared to her <\s>
<s> she's all soul she is and can write poetry or compose music as easy as i could drink a glass of beer <\s>
<s> beer damme that's all i'm fit for is beer <\s>
<s> i am a poor ignorant little beggar good for nothing but foker's entire <\s>
<s> i misspent my youth and used to get the chaps to do my exercises <\s>
<s> and what's the consequences now <\s>
<s> oh harry foker what a confounded little fool you have been <\s>
<s> as he made this dreary soliloquy he had cantered out of rotten row into the park and there was on the point of riding down a large old roomy family carriage of which he took no heed when a cheery voice cried out harry harry <\s>
<s> and looking up he beheld his aunt the lady rosherville and two of her daughters of whom the one who spoke was harry's betrothed the lady ann <\s>
<s> he started back with a pale scared look as a truth about which he had not thought during the whole day came across him <\s>
<s> there was his fate there in the back seat of that carriage <\s>
<s> what is the matter harry <\s>
<s> why are you so pale <\s>
<s> you have been raking and smoking too much you wicked boy said lady ann <\s>
<s> foker said how do aunt how do ann in a perturbed manner muttered something about a pressing engagement indeed he saw by the park clock that he must have been keeping his party in the drag waiting for nearly an hour and waved a good bye <\s>
<s> the little man and the little pony were out of sight in an instant the great carriage rolled away <\s>
<s> nobody inside was very much interested about his coming or going the countess being occupied with her spaniel the lady lucy's thoughts and eyes being turned upon a volume of sermons and those of the lady ann upon a new novel which the sisters had just procured from the library <\s>
<s> carries the reader both to richmond and greenwich poor foker found the dinner at richmond to be the most dreary entertainment upon which ever mortal man wasted his guineas <\s>
<s> i wonder how the deuce i could ever have liked these people he thought in his own mind <\s>
<s> why i can see the crow's feet under rougemont's eyes and the paint on her cheeks is laid on as thick as clown's in a pantomime <\s>
<s> the way in which that calverley talks slang is quite disgusting <\s>
<s> i hate chaff in a woman <\s>
<s> that old col coming down here in his brougham with his coronet on it and sitting bodkin between mademoiselle coralie and her mother <\s>
<s> an english peer and a horse rider of franconi's it won't do; by jove it won't do <\s>
<s> i ain't proud but it will not do <\s>
<s> twopence halfpenny for your thoughts fokey <\s>
<s> cried out miss rougemont taking her cigar from her truly vermilion lips as she beheld the young fellow lost in thought seated at the head of his table amidst melting ices and cut pineapples and bottles full and empty and cigar ashes scattered on fruit and the ruins of a dessert which had no pleasure for him <\s>
<s> does foker ever think <\s>
<s> foker here is a considerable sum of money offered by a fair capitalist at this end of the table for the present emanations of your valuable and acute intellect old boy <\s>
<s> what the deuce is that poyntz a talking about <\s>
<s> miss calverley asked of her neighbour <\s>
<s> he's a drawlin sneerin beast <\s>
<s> what a droll of a little man is that little fokare my lor mademoiselle coralie said in her own language and with the rich twang of that sunny gascony in which her swarthy cheeks and bright black eyes had got their fire <\s>
<s> what a droll of a man <\s>
<s> he does not look to have twenty years <\s>
<s> i wish i were of his age said the venerable colchicum with a sigh as he inclined his purple face towards a large goblet of claret <\s>
<s> je m'en fiche said madame brack coralie's mamma taking a great pinch out of lord colchicum's delicate gold snuff box <\s>
<s> je m'aime que les hommes faits moi <\s>
<s> n'est ce pas que tu n'aimes que les hommes faits ma bichette <\s>
<s> my lord said with a grin you flatter me madame brack <\s>
<s> taisez vous maman vous n'etes qu'une bete coralie cried with a shrug of her robust shoulders upon which my lord said that she did not flatter at any rate and pocketed his snuff box not desirous that madame brack's dubious fingers should plunge too frequently into his mackabaw <\s>
<s> there is no need to give a prolonged detail of the animated conversation which ensued during the rest of the banquet a conversation which would not much edify the reader <\s>
<s> and it is scarcely necessary to say that all ladies of the corps de dance are not like miss calverley any more than that all peers resemble that illustrious member of their order the late lamented viscount colchicum <\s>
<s> but there have been such in our memories who have loved the society of riotous youth better than the company of men of their own age and rank and have given the young ones the precious benefit of their experience and example and there have been very respectable men too who have not objected so much to the kind of entertainment as to the publicity of it <\s>
<s> i am sure for instance that our friend major pendennis would have made no sort of objection to join the a party of pleasure provided that it were en petit comite and that such men as my lord steyne and my lord colchicum were of the society <\s>
<s> give the young men their pleasures this worthy guardian said to pen more than once <\s>
<s> i'm not one of your strait laced moralists but an old man of the world begad and i know that as long as it lasts young men will be young men <\s>
<s> and there were some young men to whom this estimable philosopher accorded about seventy years as the proper period for sowing their wild oats but they were men of fashion <\s>
<s> foker drove his lovely guests home to brompton in the drag that night but he was quite thoughtful and gloomy during the whole of the little journey from richmond neither listening to the jokes of the friends behind him and on the box by his side nor enlivening them as was his wont by his own facetious sallies <\s>
<s> and when the ladies whom he had conveyed alighted at the door of their house and asked their accomplished coachman whether he would not step in and take something to drink he declined with so melancholy an air that they supposed that the governor and he had had a difference or that some calamity had befallen him and he did not tell these people what the cause of his grief was but left mesdames rougemont and calverley unheeding the cries of the latter who hung over her balcony like jezebel and called out to him to ask him to give another party soon <\s>
<s> he sent the drag home under the guidance of one of the grooms and went on foot himself his hands in his pockets plunged in thought <\s>
<s> the stars and moon shining tranquilly overhead looked down upon mr <\s>
<s> foker that night as he in his turn sentimentally regarded them <\s>
<s> and he went and gazed upwards at the house in grosvenor place and at the windows which he supposed to be those of the beloved object and he moaned and he sighed in a way piteous and surprising to witness which policeman x did who informed sir francis clavering's people as they took the refreshment of beer on the coach box at the neighbouring public house after bringing home their lady from the french play that there had been another chap hanging about the premises that evening a little chap dressed like a swell <\s>
<s> and now with that perspicuity and ingenuity and enterprise which only belongs to a certain passion mr <\s>
