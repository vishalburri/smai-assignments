<s> watching this devouring care and racking disappointment in her friend laura once said to helen if pen had loved me as you wished i should have gained him but i should have lost you mamma i know i should and i like you to love me best <\s>
<s> men do not know what it is to love as we do i think and helen sighing agreed to this portion of the young lady's speech though she protested against the former part <\s>
<s> for my part i suppose miss laura was right in both statements and with regard to the latter assertion especially that it is an old and received truism love is an hour with us it is all night and all day with a woman <\s>
<s> damon has taxes sermon parade tailors bills parliamentary duties and the deuce knows what to think of delia has to think about damon damon is the oak or the post and stands up and delia is the ivy or the honeysuckle whose arms twine about him <\s>
<s> is it not so delia <\s>
<s> is it not your nature to creep about his feet and kiss them to twine round his trunk and hang there and damon's to stand like a british man with his hands in his breeches pocket while the pretty fond parasite clings round him <\s>
<s> old pendennis had only accompanied our friends to the water's edge and left them on board the boat giving the chief charge of the little expedition to warrington <\s>
<s> he himself was bound on a brief visit to the house of a great man a friend of his after which sojourn he proposed to join his sister in law at the german watering place whither the party was bound <\s>
<s> the major himself thought that his long attentions to his sick family had earned for him a little relaxation and though the best of the partridges were thinned off the pheasants were still to be shot at stillbrook where the noble owner still was old pendennis betook himself to that hospitable mansion and disported there with great comfort to himself <\s>
<s> a royal duke some foreigners of note some illustrious statesmen and some pleasant people visited it it did the old fellow's heart good to see his name in the morning post amongst the list of the distinguished company which the marquis of steyne was entertaining at his country house at stillbrook <\s>
<s> he was a very useful and pleasant personage in a country house <\s>
<s> he entertained the young men with queer little anecdotes and grivoises stories on their shooting parties or in their smoking room where they laughed at him and with him <\s>
<s> he was obsequious with the ladies of a morning in the rooms dedicated to them <\s>
<s> he walked the new arrivals about the park and gardens and showed them the carte du pays and where there was the best view of the mansion and where the most favourable point to look at the lake he showed where the timber was to be felled and where the old road went before the new bridge was built and the hill cut down and where the place in the wood was where old lord lynx discovered sir phelim o'neal on his knees before her ladyship etc <\s>
<s> etc he called the lodge keepers and gardeners by their names he knew the number of domestics that sat down in the housekeeper's room and how many dined in the servants' hall he had a word for everybody and about everybody and a little against everybody <\s>
<s> he was invaluable in a country house in a word and richly merited and enjoyed his vacation after his labours <\s>
<s> and perhaps whilst he was thus deservedly enjoying himself with his country friends the major was not ill pleased at transferring to warrington the command of the family expedition to the continent and thus perforce keeping him in the service of the ladies a servitude which george was only too willing to undergo for his friend's sake and for that of a society which he found daily more delightful <\s>
<s> warrington was a good german scholar and was willing to give miss laura lessons in the language who was very glad to improve herself though pen for his part was too weak or lazy now to resume his german studies <\s>
<s> warrington acted as courier and interpreter warrington saw the baggage in and out of ships inns and carriages managed the money matters and put the little troop into marching order <\s>
<s> warrington found out where the english church was and if mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and miss laura were inclined to go thither walked with great decorum along with them <\s>
<s> warrington walked by mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis's donkey when that lady went out on her evening excursions or took carriages for her or got galignani for her or devised comfortable seats under the lime trees for her when the guests paraded after dinner and the kursaal band at the bath where our tired friends stopped performed their pleasant music under the trees <\s>
<s> many a fine whiskered prussian or french dandy come to the bath for the trente et quarante cast glances of longing towards the pretty fresh coloured english girl who accompanied the pale widow and would have longed to take a turn with her at the galop or the waltz <\s>
<s> but laura did not appear in the ballroom except once or twice when pen vouchsafed to walk with her and as for warrington that rough diamond had not had the polish of a dancing master and he did not know how to waltz though he would have liked to learn if he could have had such a partner as laura such a partner <\s>
<s> psha what had a stiff bachelor to do with partners and waltzing <\s>
