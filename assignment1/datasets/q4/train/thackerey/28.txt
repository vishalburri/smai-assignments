<s> pen's academical life he attended classical and mathematical lectures with tolerable assiduity but discovering before very long time that he had little taste or genius for the pursuing of the exact sciences and being perhaps rather annoyed that one or two very vulgar young men who did not even use straps to their trousers so as to cover the abominably thick and coarse shoes and stockings which they wore beat him completely in the lecture room he gave up his attendance at that course and announced to his fond parent that he proposed to devote himself exclusively to the cultivation of greek and roman literature <\s>
<s> pendennis was for her part quite satisfied that her darling boy should pursue that branch of learning for which he had the greatest inclination and only besought him not to ruin his health by too much study for she had heard the most melancholy stories of young students who by over fatigue had brought on brain fevers and perished untimely in the midst of their university career <\s>
<s> and pen's health which was always delicate was to be regarded as she justly said beyond all considerations or vain honours <\s>
<s> pen although not aware of any lurking disease which was likely to end his life yet kindly promised his mamma not to sit up reading too late of nights and stuck to his word in this respect with a great deal more tenacity of resolution than he exhibited upon some other occasions when perhaps he was a little remiss <\s>
<s> presently he began too to find that he learned little good in the classical lecture <\s>
<s> his fellow students there were too dull as in mathematics they were too learned for him <\s>
<s> buck the tutor was no better a scholar than many a fifth form boy at grey friars might have some stupid humdrum notions about the metre and grammatical construction of a passage of aeschylus or aristophanes but had no more notion of the poetry than mrs <\s>
<s> binge his bed maker and pen grew weary of hearing the dull students and tutor blunder through a few lines of a play which he could read in a tenth part of the time which they gave to it <\s>
<s> after all private reading as he began to perceive was the only study which was really profitable to a man and he announced to his mamma that he should read by himself a great deal more and in public a great deal less <\s>
<s> that excellent woman knew no more about homer than she did about algebra but she was quite contented with pen's arrangements regarding his course of studies and felt perfectly confident that her dear boy would get the place which he merited <\s>
<s> pen did not come home until after christmas a little to the fond mother's disappointment and laura's who was longing for him to make a fine snow fortification such as he had made three winters before <\s>
<s> but he was invited to logwood lady agnes foker's where there were private theatricals and a gay christmas party of very fine folks some of them whom major pendennis would on no account have his nephew neglect <\s>
<s> however he stayed at home for the last three weeks of the vacation and laura had the opportunity of remarking what a quantity of fine new clothes he brought with him and his mother admired his improved appearance and manly and decided tone <\s>
<s> he did not come home at easter but when he arrived for the long vacation he brought more smart clothes appearing in the morning in wonderful shooting jackets with remarkable buttons and in the evening in gorgeous velvet waistcoats with richly embroidered cravats and curious linen <\s>
<s> and as she pried about his room she saw oh such a beautiful dressing case with silver mountings and a quantity of lovely rings and jewellery <\s>
<s> and he had a new french watch and gold chain in place of the big old chronometer with its bunch of jingling seals which had hung from the fob of john pendennis and by the second hand of which the defunct doctor had felt many a patient's pulse in his time <\s>
<s> it was but a few months back pen had longed for this watch which he thought the most splendid and august timepiece in the world and just before he went to college helen had taken it out of her trinket box where it had remained unwound since the death of her husband and given it to pen with a solemn and appropriate little speech respecting his father's virtues and the proper use of time <\s>
<s> this portly and valuable chronometer pen now pronounced to be out of date and indeed made some comparisons between it and a warming pan which laura thought disrespectful and he left the watch in a drawer in the company of soiled primrose gloves cravats which had gone out of favour and of that other school watch which has once before been mentioned in this history <\s>
<s> our old friend rebecca pen pronounced to be no long up to his weight and swapped her away for another and more powerful horse for which he had to pay rather a heavy figure <\s>
<s> pendennis gave the boy the money for the new horse and laura cried when rebecca was fetched away <\s>
<s> also pen brought a large box of cigars branded colorados afrancesados telescopios fudson oxford street or by some such strange titles and began to consume these not only about the stables and green houses where they were very good for helen's plants but in his own study of which practice his mother did not at first approve <\s>
<s> but he was at work upon a prize poem he said and could not compose without his cigar and quoted the late lamented it lord byron's lines in favour of the custom of smoking <\s>
<s> as he was smoking to such good purpose his mother could not of course refuse permission in fact the good soul coming into the room one day in the midst of pen's labours he was consulting a novel which had recently appeared for the cultivation of the light literature of his own country as well as of foreign nations became every student helen we say coming into the room and finding pen on the sofa at this work rather than disturb him went for a light box and his cigar case to his bedroom which was adjacent and actually put the cigar into his mouth and lighted the match at which he kindled it <\s>
<s> pen laughed and kissed his mother's hand as it hung fondly over the back of the sofa <\s>
<s> dear old mother he said if i were to tell you to burn the house down i think you would do it <\s>
<s> and it is very likely that mr <\s>
<s> pen was right and that the foolish woman would have done almost as much for him as he said <\s>
<s> besides the works of english light literature which this diligent student devoured he brought down boxes of the light literature of the neighbouring country of france into the leaves of which when helen dipped she read such things as caused her to open her eyes with wonder <\s>
<s> but pen showed her that it was not he who made the books though it was absolutely necessary that he should keep up his french by an acquaintance with the most celebrated writers of the day and that it was as clearly his duty to read the eminent paul de kock as to study swift or moliere <\s>
<s> pendennis yielded with a sigh of perplexity <\s>
<s> but miss laura was warned off the books both by his anxious mother and that rigid moralist mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis himself who however he might be called upon to study every branch of literature in order to form his mind and to perfect his style would by no means prescribe such a course of reading to a young lady whose business in life was very different <\s>
<s> in the course of this long vacation mr <\s>
<s> pen drank up the bin of claret which his father had laid in and of which we have heard the son remark that there was not a headache in a hogshead and this wine being exhausted he wrote for a further supply to his wine merchants messrs <\s>
<s> binney and latham of mark lane london from whom indeed old doctor portman had recommended pen to get a supply of port and sherry on going to college <\s>
<s> you will have no doubt to entertain your young friends at boniface with wine parties the honest rector had remarked to the lad <\s>
<s> they used to be customary at college in my time and i would advise you to employ an honest and respectable house in london for your small stock of wine rather than to have recourse to the oxbridge tradesmen whose liquor if i remember rightly was both deleterious in quality and exorbitant in price <\s>
<s> and the obedient young gentleman took the doctor's advice and patronised messrs <\s>
<s> binney and latham at the rector's suggestion <\s>
<s> so when he wrote orders for a stock of wine to be sent down to the cellars at fairoaks he hinted that messrs <\s>
<s> might send in his university account for wine at the same time with the fairoaks bill <\s>
<s> the poor widow was frightened at the amount <\s>
<s> but pen laughed at her old fashioned views said that the bill was moderate that everybody drank claret and champagne now and finally the widow paid feeling dimly that the expenses of her household were increasing considerably and that her narrow income would scarce suffice to meet them <\s>
<s> but they were only occasional <\s>
<s> pen merely came home for a few weeks at the vacation <\s>
<s> laura and she might pinch when he was gone <\s>
<s> in the brief time he was with them ought they not to make him happy <\s>
<s> arthur's own allowances were liberal all this time indeed much more so than those of the sons of far more wealthy men <\s>
<s> years before the thrifty and affectionate john pendennis whose darling project it had ever been to give his son a university education and those advantages of which his own father's extravagance had deprived him had begun laying by a store of money which he called arthur's education fund <\s>
<s> year after year in his book his executors found entries of sums vested as a <\s>
<s> f and during the period subsequent to her husband's decease and before pen's entry at college the widow had added sundry sums to this fund so that when arthur went up to oxbridge it reached no inconsiderable amount <\s>
<s> let him be liberally allowanced was major pendennis's maxim <\s>
<s> let him make his first entree into the world as a gentleman and take his place with men of good rank and station after giving it to him it will be his own duty to hold it <\s>
<s> there is no such bad policy as stinting a boy or putting him on a lower allowance than his fellows <\s>
<s> arthur will have to face the world and fight for himself presently <\s>
<s> meanwhile we shall have procured for him good friends gentlemanly habits and have him well backed and well trained against the time when the real struggle comes <\s>
<s> and these liberal opinions the major probably advanced both because they were just and because he was not dealing with his own money <\s>
<s> thus young pen the only son of an estated country gentleman with a good allowance and a gentlemanlike bearing and person looked to be a lad of much more consequence than he was really and was held by the oxbridge authorities tradesmen and undergraduates as quite a young buck and member of the aristocracy <\s>
<s> his manner was frank brave and perhaps a little impertinent as becomes a high spirited youth <\s>
<s> he was perfectly generous and free handed with his money which seemed pretty plentiful <\s>
<s> he loved joviality and had a good voice for a song <\s>
<s> boat racing had not risen in pen's time to the fureur which as we are given to understand it has since attained in the university and riding and tandem driving were the fashions of the ingenuous youth <\s>
<s> pen rode well to hounds appeared in pink as became a young buck and not particularly extravagant in equestrian or any other amusement yet managed to run up a fine bill at nile's the livery stable keeper and in a number of other quarters <\s>
<s> in fact this lucky young gentleman had almost every taste to a considerable degree <\s>
<s> he was very fond of books of all sorts doctor portman had taught him to like rare editions and his own taste led him to like beautiful bindings <\s>
<s> it was marvellous what tall copies and gilding and marbling and blind tooling the booksellers and binders put upon pen's bookshelves <\s>
<s> he had a very fair taste in matters of art and a keen relish for prints of a high school none of your french opera dancers or tawdry racing prints such as had delighted the simple eyes of mr <\s>
<s> spicer his predecessor but your stranges and rembrandt etchings and wilkies before the letter with which his apartments were furnished presently in the most perfect good taste as was allowed in the university where this young fellow got no small reputation <\s>
<s> we have mentioned that he exhibited a certain partiality for rings jewellery and fine raiment of all sorts and it must be owned that mr <\s>
<s> pen during his time at the university was rather a dressy man and loved to array himself in splendour <\s>
<s> he and his polite friends would dress themselves out with as much care in order to go and dine at each other's rooms as other folks would who were going to enslave a mistress <\s>
<s> they said he used to wear rings over his kid gloves which he always denies but what follies will not youth perpetrate with its own admirable gravity and simplicity <\s>
<s> that he took perfumed baths is a truth and he used to say that he took them after meeting certain men of a very low set in hall <\s>
<s> in pen's second year when miss fotheringay made her chief hit in london and scores of prints were published of her pen had one of these hung in his bedroom and confided to the men of his set how awfully how wildly how madly how passionately he had loved that woman <\s>
<s> he showed them in confidence the verses that he had written to her and his brow would darken his eyes roll his chest heave with emotion as he recalled that fatal period of his life and described the woes and agonies which he had suffered <\s>
<s> the verses were copied out handed about sneered at admired passed from coterie to coterie <\s>
<s> there are few things which elevate a lad in the estimation of his brother boys more than to have a character for a great and romantic passion <\s>
<s> perhaps there is something noble in it at all times among very young men it is considered heroic pen was pronounced a tremendous fellow <\s>
<s> they said he had almost committed suicide that he had fought a duel with a baronet about her <\s>
<s> freshmen pointed him out to each other <\s>
<s> as at the promenade time at two o'clock he swaggered out of college surrounded by his cronies he was famous to behold <\s>
<s> he was elaborately attired <\s>
<s> he would ogle the ladies who came to lionise the university and passed before him on the arms of happy gownsmen and give his opinion upon their personal charms or their toilettes with the gravity of a critic whose experience entitled him to speak with authority <\s>
<s> men used to say that they had been walking with pendennis and were as pleased to be seen in his company as some of us would be if we walked with a duke down pall mall <\s>
<s> he and the proctor capped each other as they met as if they were rival powers and the men hardly knew which was the greater <\s>
<s> in fact in the course of his second year arthur pendennis had become one of the men of fashion in the university <\s>
<s> it is curious to watch that facile admiration and simple fidelity of youth <\s>
<s> they hang round a leader and wonder at him and love him and imitate him <\s>
<s> no generous boy ever lived i suppose that has not had some wonderment of admiration for another boy and monsieur pen at oxbridge had his school his faithful band of friends and his rivals <\s>
<s> when the young men heard at the haberdashers shops that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis of boniface had just ordered a crimson satin cravat you would see a couple of dozen crimson satin cravats in main street in the course of the week and simon the jeweller was known to sell no less than two gross of pendennis pins from a pattern which the young gentleman had selected in his shop <\s>
<s> now if any person with an arithmetical turn of mind will take the trouble to calculate what a sum of money it would cost a young man to indulge freely in all the above propensities which we have said mr <\s>
<s> pen possessed it will be seen that a young fellow with such liberal tastes and amusements must needs in the course of two or three years spend or owe a very handsome sum of money <\s>
<s> we have said our friend pen had not a calculating turn <\s>
<s> no one propensity of his was outrageously extravagant and it is certain that paddington's tailor's account guttlebury's cook's bill for dinners dillon tandy's bill with finn the print seller for raphael morgheus and landseer proofs and wormall's dealings with parkton the great bookseller for aldine editions black letter folios and richly illuminated missals of the xvi <\s>
