<s> dance away all night with pynsent and be very happy pen <\s>
<s> laura was very thankful for this letter and to think that there was goodness and forgiveness still in her mother's boy <\s>
<s> pen went downstairs his heart reproaching him for his absurd behaviour to laura whose gentle and imploring looks followed and rebuked him and he was scarcely out of the ballroom door but he longed to turn back and ask her pardon <\s>
<s> but he remembered that he had left her with that confounded pynsent <\s>
<s> he could not apologise before him <\s>
<s> he would compromise and forget his wrath and make his peace with the frenchman <\s>
<s> the chevalier was pacing down below in the hall of the inn when pen descended from the ballroom and he came up to pen with all sorts of fun and mischief lighting up his jolly face <\s>
<s> i have got him in the coffee room he said with a brace of pistols and a candle <\s>
<s> or would you like swords on the beach <\s>
<s> mirobolant is a dead hand with the foils and killed four gardes du corps with his own point in the barricades of july <\s>
<s> confound it said pen in a fury i can't fight a cook <\s>
<s> he is a chevalier of july replied the other <\s>
<s> they present arms to him in his own country <\s>
<s> and do you ask me captain strong to go out with a servant <\s>
<s> pen asked fiercely i'll call a policeman him but but you'll invite me to hair triggers <\s>
<s> cried strong with a laugh <\s>
<s> thank you for nothing i was but joking <\s>
<s> i came to settle quarrels not to fight them <\s>
<s> i have been soothing down mirobolant i have told him that you did not apply the word cook to him in an offensive sense that it was contrary to all the customs of the country that a hired officer of a household as i called it should give his arm to the daughter of the house <\s>
<s> and then he told pen the grand secret which he had had from madame fribsby of the violent passion under which the poor artist was labouring <\s>
<s> when arthur heard this tale he broke out into a hearty laugh in which strong joined and his rage against the poor cook vanished at once <\s>
<s> he had been absurdly jealous himself all the evening and had longed for a pretext to insult pynsent <\s>
<s> he remembered how jealous he had been of oaks in his first affair he was ready to pardon anything to a man under a passion like that and he went into the coffee room where mirobolant was waiting with an outstretched hand and made him a speech in french in which he declared that he was sincerement fache d'avoir use une expression qui avoit pu blesser monsieur mirobolant et qu'il donnoit sa parole comme un gentilhomme qu'il ne l'avoit jamais jamais intende said pen who made a shot at a french word for intended and was secretly much pleased with his own fluency and correctness in speaking that language <\s>
<s> cried strong as much amused with pen's speech as pleased by his kind manner <\s>
<s> and the chevalier mirobolant of course withdraws and sincerely regrets the expression of which he made use <\s>
<s> monsieur pendennis has disproved my words himself said alcide with great politeness he has shown that he is a galant homme <\s>
<s> and so they shook hands and parted arthur in the first place despatching his note to laura before he and strong committed themselves to the butcher boy <\s>
<s> as they drove along strong complimented pen upon his behaviour as well as upon his skill in french <\s>
<s> you're a good fellow pendennis and you speak french like chateaubriand by jove <\s>
<s> i've been accustomed to it from my youth upwards said pen and strong had the grace not to laugh for five minutes when he exploded into fits of hilarity which pendennis has never perhaps understood up to this day <\s>
<s> it was daybreak when they got to the brawl where they separated <\s>
<s> by that time the ball at baymouth was over too <\s>
<s> madame fribsby and mirobolant were on their way home in the clavering fly laura was in bed with an easy heart and asleep at lady rockminster's and the claverings at rest at the inn at baymouth where they had quarters for the night <\s>
<s> a short time after the disturbance between pen and the chef blanche had come out of the refreshment room looking as pale as a lemon ice <\s>
<s> she told her maid having no other confidante at hand that she had met with the most romantic adventure the most singular man one who had known the author of her being her persecuted her unhappy her heroic her murdered father and she began a sonnet to his manes before she went to sleep <\s>
<s> so pen returned to fairoaks in company with his friend the chevalier without having uttered a word of the message which he had been so anxious to deliver to laura at baymouth <\s>
<s> he could wait however until her return home which was to take place on the succeeding day <\s>
<s> he was not seriously jealous of the progress made by mr <\s>
<s> pynsent in her favour and he felt pretty certain that in this as in any other family arrangement he had but to ask and have and laura like his mother could refuse him nothing <\s>
<s> when helen's anxious looks inquired of him what had happened at baymouth and whether her darling project was fulfilled pen in a gay tone told of the calamity which had befallen laughingly said that no man could think about declarations under such a mishap and made light of the matter <\s>
<s> there will be plenty of time for sentiment dear mother when laura comes back he said and he looked in the glass with a killing air and his mother put his hair off his forehead and kissed him and of course thought for her part that no woman could resist him and was exceedingly happy that day <\s>
<s> when he was not with her mr <\s>
<s> pen occupied himself in packing books and portmanteaus burning and arranging papers cleaning his gun and putting it into its case in fact in making dispositions for departure <\s>
<s> for though he was ready to marry this gentleman was eager to go to london too rightly considering that at three and twenty it was quite time for him to begin upon the serious business of life and to set about making a fortune as quickly as possible <\s>
<s> the means to this end he had already shaped out for himself <\s>
<s> i shall take chambers he said and enter myself at an inn of court <\s>
<s> with a couple of hundred pounds i shall be able to carry through the first year very well after that i have little doubt my pen will support me as it is doing with several oxbridge men now in town <\s>
<s> i have a tragedy a comedy and a novel all nearly finished and for which i can't fail to get a price <\s>
<s> and so i shall be able to live pretty well without drawing upon my poor mother until i have made my way at the bar <\s>
<s> then some day i will come back and make her dear soul happy by marrying laura <\s>
<s> she is as good and as sweet tempered a girl as ever lived besides being really very good looking and the engagement will serve to steady me won't it ponto <\s>
<s> thus smoking his pipe and talking to his dog as he sauntered through the gardens and orchards of the little domain of fairoaks this young day dreamer built castles in the air for himself yes she'll steady me won't she <\s>
<s> and you'll miss me when i've gone won't you old boy <\s>
<s> he asked of ponto who quivered his tail and thrust his brown nose into his master's fist <\s>
<s> ponto licked his hand and shoe as they all did in that house and mr <\s>
<s> pen received their homage as other folks do the flattery which they get <\s>
<s> laura came home rather late in the evening of the second day and mr <\s>
<s> pynsent as ill luck would have it drove her from clavering <\s>
<s> the poor girl could not refuse his offer but his appearance brought a dark cloud upon the brow of arthur pendennis <\s>
