<s> so she waited and waited in hopes that arthur would come <\s>
<s> she waited for a whole week and it was at the end of that time that the poor little creature heard from costigan of the illness under which arthur was suffering <\s>

<s> the major was merely passing through london on his way to the marquis of steyne's house of stillbrook where he was engaged to shoot partridges <\s>
<s> morgan came back to his master with a very long face <\s>
<s> he had seen mr <\s>
<s> arthur was very bad indeed mr <\s>
<s> arthur was in bed with a fever <\s>
<s> a doctor ought to be sent to him and morgan thought his case most alarming <\s>
<s> this was sad news indeed <\s>
<s> he had hoped that arthur could come down to stillbrook he had arranged that he should go and procured an invitation for his nephew from lord steyne <\s>
<s> he must go himself he couldn't throw lord steyne over the fever might be catching it might be measles he had never himself had the measles they were dangerous when contracted at his age <\s>
<s> was anybody with mr <\s>
<s> morgan said there was somebody a nussing of mr <\s>
<s> the major then asked had his nephew taken any advice <\s>
<s> her cheeks flushed her frame trembled her eyes beamed love anger defiance <\s>
<s> you would like to speak ill of him she said but you daren't you know you daren't <\s>
<s> i knew him many years since bows continued when he was almost as young as you are and he had a romantic attachment for our friend the captain's daughter lady mirabel that is now <\s>
<s> i suppose there was other people too that had romantic attachments for miss costigan she said i don't want to hear about em <\s>
<s> he wanted to marry her but their ages were quite disproportionate and their rank in life <\s>
<s> she would not have him because he had no money <\s>
<s> she acted very wisely in refusing him for the two would have been very unhappy and she wasn't a fit person to go and live with his family or to make his home comfortable <\s>
<s> pendennis has his way to make in the world and must marry a lady of his own rank <\s>
<s> a woman who loves a man will not ruin his prospects cause him to quarrel with his family and lead him into poverty and misery for her gratification <\s>
<s> an honest girl won't do that for her own sake or for the man's <\s>
<s> fanny's emotion which but now had been that of defiance and anger here turned to dismay and supplication <\s>
<s> what do i know about marrying bows <\s>
<s> when was there any talk of it <\s>
<s> what has there been between this young gentleman and me that's to make people speak so cruel <\s>
<s> it was not my doing nor arthur's mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's that i met him at vauxhall <\s>
<s> it was the captain took me and ma there <\s>
<s> we never thought of nothing wrong i'm sure <\s>
<s> he came and rescued us and he was so very kind <\s>
<s> then he came to call and ask after us and very very good it was of a such grand gentleman to be so polite to humble folks like us <\s>
<s> and yesterday ma and me just went to walk in the temple gardens and and here she broke out with that usual unanswerable female argument of tears and cried oh <\s>
<s> i wish i was dead <\s>
<s> i wish i was laid in my grave and had never never seen him <\s>
<s> he said as much himself fanny bows said and fanny asked through her sobs why why should he wish he had never seen her <\s>
<s> had she ever done him any harm <\s>
<s> oh she would perish rather than do him any harm <\s>
<s> whereupon the musician informed her of the conversation of the day previous showed her that pen could not and must not think of her as a wife fitting for him and that she as she valued her honest reputation must strive too to forget him <\s>
<s> and fanny leaving the musician convinced but still of the same mind and promising that she would avoid the danger which menaced her went back to the porter's lodge and told her mother all <\s>
<s> she talked of her love for arthur and bewailed in her artless manner the inequality of their condition that set barriers between them <\s>
<s> there's the lady of lyons fanny said oh ma <\s>
<s> how i did love mr <\s>
<s> macready when i saw him do it and pauline for being faithful to poor claude and always thinking of him and he coming back to her an officer through all his dangers <\s>
<s> and if everybody admires pauline and i'm sure everybody does for being so true to a poor man why should a gentleman be ashamed of loving a poor girl <\s>
<s> arthur loves me oh no no <\s>
<s> i ain't worthy of him only a princess is worthy of such a gentleman as him <\s>
<s> such a poet writing so beautifully and looking so grand <\s>
<s> i am sure he's a nobleman and of ancient family and kep out of his estate <\s>
<s> perhaps his uncle has it <\s>
<s> ah if i might oh how i'd serve him and work for him and slave for him that i would <\s>
<s> i wouldn't ask for more than that ma just to be allowed to see him of a morning and sometimes he'd say how d'you fanny <\s>
<s> or god bless you fanny <\s>
<s> as he said on sunday <\s>
<s> and i'd work and work and i'd sit up all night and read and learn and make myself worthy of him <\s>
<s> the captain says his mother lives in the country and is a grand lady there <\s>
<s> oh how i wish i might go and be her servant ma <\s>
<s> i can do plenty of things and work very neat and and sometimes he'd come home and i should see him <\s>
<s> the girl's head fell on her mother's shoulder as she spoke and she gave way to a plentiful outpouring of girlish tears to which the matron of course joined her own <\s>
<s> you mustn't think no more of him fanny she said <\s>
<s> if he don't come to you he's a horrid wicked man <\s>
<s> don't call him so mother fanny replied <\s>
<s> he's the best of men the best and the kindest <\s>
<s> bows says he thinks he is unhappy at leaving poor little fanny <\s>
<s> it wasn't his fault was it that we met and it ain't his that i mustn't see him again <\s>
<s> he says i mustn't and i mustn't mother <\s>
<s> he'll forget me but i shall never forget him <\s>
<s> i'll pray for him and love him always until i die and i shall die i know i shall and then my spirit will always go and be with him <\s>
<s> you forget your poor mother fanny and you'll break my heart by goin on so mrs <\s>
<s> perhaps you will see him <\s>
<s> i'm sure you'll see him <\s>
<s> i'm sure he'll come to day <\s>
<s> if ever i saw a man in love that man is him <\s>
<s> when emily budd's young man first came about her he was sent away by old budd a most respectable man and violoncello in the orchestra at the wells and his own family wouldn't hear of it neither <\s>
<s> but he came back <\s>
<s> we all knew he would <\s>
<s> emily always said so and he married her and this one will come back too and you mark a mother's words and see if he don't dear <\s>
<s> at this point of the conversation mr <\s>
<s> bolton entered the lodge for his evening meal <\s>
<s> at the father's appearance the talk between mother and daughter ceased instantly <\s>
<s> bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertaker's aide de camp and said lor mr <\s>
<s> who'd have thought to see you away from the club of a saturday night <\s>
<s> fanny dear get your pa some supper <\s>
<s> what will you have b <\s>
<s> the poor gurl's got a gathering in her eye or somethink in it i was lookin at it just now as you came in <\s>
<s> and she squeezed her daughter's hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy and fanny's tears were dried up likewise and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practise and with which weapons of defence nature endows them the traces of her emotion disappeared and she went and took her work and sate in the corner so demure and quiet that the careless male parent never suspected that anything ailed her <\s>
<s> thus as if fate seemed determined to inflame and increase the poor child's malady and passion all circumstances and all parties round about her urged it on <\s>
<s> her mother encouraged and applauded it and the very words which bows used in endeavouring to repress her flame only augmented this unlucky fever <\s>
<s> pen was not wicked and a seducer pen was high minded in wishing to avoid her <\s>
<s> pen loved her the good and the great the magnificent youth with the chains of gold and the scented auburn hair <\s>
