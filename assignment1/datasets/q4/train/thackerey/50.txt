<s> we must deal kindly with the eccentricities of genius and remember that the very ardour and enthusiasm of temperament which makes the author delightful often leads the man astray <\s>
<s> a fiddlestick about men of genius <\s>
<s> warrington cried out who was a very severe moralist upon some points though possibly a very had practitioner <\s>
<s> i deny that there are so many geniuses as people who whimper about the fate of men of letters assert there are <\s>
<s> there are thousands of clever fellows in the world who could if they would turn verses write articles read books and deliver a judgment upon them the talk of professional critics and writers is not a whit more brilliant or profound or amusing than that of any other society of educated people <\s>
<s> if a lawyer or a soldier or a parson outruns his income and does not pay his bills he must go to gaol and an author must go too <\s>
<s> if an author fuddles himself i don't know why he should be let off a headache the next morning if he orders a coat from the tailor's why he shouldn't pay for it <\s>
<s> i would give him more money to buy coats said pen smiling <\s>
<s> i suppose i should like to belong to a well dressed profession <\s>
<s> i protest against that wretch of a middle man whom i see between genius and his great landlord the public and who stops more than half of the labourer's earnings and fame <\s>
<s> i am a prose labourer warrington said you my boy are a poet in a small way and so i suppose consider you are authorised to be flighty <\s>
<s> what is it you want <\s>
<s> do you want a body of capitalists that shall be forced to purchase the works of all authors who may present themselves manuscript in hand <\s>
<s> everybody who writes his epic every driveller who can or can't spell and produces his novel or his tragedy are they all to come and find a bag of sovereigns in exchange for their worthless reams of paper <\s>
<s> who is to settle what is good or bad saleable or otherwise <\s>
<s> will you give the buyer leave in fine to purchase or not <\s>
<s> why sir when johnson sate behind the screen at saint john's gate and took his dinner apart because he was too shabby and poor to join the literary bigwigs who were regaling themselves round mr <\s>
<s> cave's best table cloth the tradesman was doing him no wrong <\s>
<s> you couldn't force the publisher to recognise the man of genius in the young man who presented himself before him ragged gaunt and hungry <\s>
<s> rags are not a proof of genius whereas capital is absolute as times go and is perforce the bargain master <\s>
<s> it has a right to deal with the literary inventor as with any other if i produce a novelty in the book trade i must do the best i can with it but i can no more force mr <\s>
<s> murray to purchase my book of travels or sermons than i can compel mr <\s>
<s> tattersall to give me a hundred guineas for my horse <\s>
<s> i may have my own ideas of the value of my pegasus and think him the most wonderful of animals but the dealer has a right to his opinion too and may want a lady's horse or a cob for a heavy timid rider or a sound hack for the road and my beast won't suit him <\s>
<s> you deal in metaphors warrington pen said but you rightly say that you are very prosaic <\s>
<s> there is something about the kindness of that man and the gentleness of that sweet creature of a wife which touches me profoundly <\s>
<s> i like him i am afraid better than a better man <\s>
<s> and so do i warrington said <\s>
<s> let us give him the benefit of our sympathy and the pity that is due to his weakness though i fear that sort of kindness would be resented as contempt by a more high minded man <\s>
<s> you see he takes his consolation along with his misfortune and one generates the other or balances ii as the way of the world <\s>
<s> he is a prisoner but he is not unhappy <\s>
<s> his genius sings within his prison bars pen said <\s>
<s> yes warrington said bitterly shandon accommodates himself to a cage pretty well <\s>
<s> he ought to be wretched but he has jack and tom to drink with and that consoles him he might have a high place but as he can't why he can drink with tom and jack he might be providing for his wife and children but thomas and john have got a bottle of brandy which they want him to taste he might pay poor snip the tailor the twenty pounds which the poor devil wants for his landlord but john and thomas lay their hands upon his purse and so he drinks whilst his tradesman goes to gaol and his family to ruin <\s>
<s> let us pity the misfortunes of genius and conspire against the publishing tyrants who oppress men of letters <\s>
