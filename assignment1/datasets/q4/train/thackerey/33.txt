<s> and with this she looked pen full in the face as if every word the little hypocrite said was gospel truth <\s>
<s> thus an intimacy was arranged and prepared beforehand between the fairoaks family and their wealthy neighbours at the park and pen and laura were to the full as eager for their arrival as even the most curious of the clavering folks <\s>
<s> a londoner who sees fresh faces and yawns at them every day may smile at the eagerness with which country people expect a visitor <\s>
<s> a cockney comes amongst them and is remembered by his rural entertainers for years after he has left them and forgotten them very likely floated far away from them on the vast london sea <\s>
<s> but the islanders remember long after the mariner has sailed away and can tell you what he said and what he wore and how he looked and how he laughed <\s>
<s> in fine a new arrival is an event in the country not to be understood by us who don't and had rather not know who lives next door <\s>
<s> when the painters and upholsterers had done their work in the house and so beautified it under captain strong's superintendence that he might well be proud of his taste that gentleman announced that he should go to london where the whole family had arrived by this time and should speedily return to establish them in their renovated mansion <\s>
<s> detachments of domestics preceded them <\s>
<s> carriages came down by sea and were brought over from baymouth by horses which had previously arrived under the care of grooms and coachmen <\s>
<s> one day the alacrity coach brought down on its roof two large and melancholy men who were dropped at the park lodge with their trunks and who were messieurs frederic and james metropolitan footmen who had no objection to the country and brought with them state and other suits of the clavering uniform <\s>
<s> on another day the mail deposited at the gate a foreign gentleman adorned with many ringlets and chains <\s>
<s> he made a great riot at the lodge gate to the keeper's wife who being a west country woman did not understand his english or his gascon french because there was no carriage in waiting to drive him to the house a mile off and because he could not walk entire leagues in his fatigued state and varnished boots <\s>
<s> this was monsieur alcide mirobolant formerly chef of his highness the duc de borodino of h <\s>
<s> eminence cardinal beccafico and at present chef of the bouche of sir clavering baronet monsieur mirobolant's library pictures and piano had arrived previously in charge of the intelligent young englishman his aide de camp <\s>
<s> he was moreover aided by a professed female cook likewise from london who had inferior females under her orders <\s>
<s> he did not dine in the steward's room but took his nutriment in solitude in his own apartments where a female servant was affected to his private use <\s>
<s> it was a grand sight to behold him in his dressing gown composing a menu <\s>
<s> he always sate down and played the piano for some time before that <\s>
<s> if interrupted he remonstrated pathetically with his little maid <\s>
<s> every great artist he said had need of solitude to perfectionate his works <\s>
<s> but we are advancing matters in the fulness of our love and respect for monsieur mirobolant and bringing him prematurely on the stage <\s>
<s> the chevalier strong had a hand in the engagement of all the london domestics and indeed seemed to be the master of the house <\s>
<s> there were those among them who said he was the house steward only he dined with the family <\s>
<s> howbeit he knew how to make himself respected and two of by no means the least comfortable rooms of the house were assigned to his particular use <\s>
<s> he was walking upon the terrace finally upon the eventful day when amidst an immense jangling of bells from clavering church where the flag was flying an open carriage and one of those travelling chariots or family arks which only english philoprogenitiveness could invent drove rapidly with foaming horses through the park gates and up to the steps of the hall <\s>
<s> the two battans of the sculptured door flew open <\s>
<s> the superior officers in black the large and melancholy gentlemen now in livery with their hair in powder the country menials engaged to aid them were in waiting in the hall and bowed like elms when autumn winds wail in the park <\s>
<s> through this avenue passed sir francis clavering with a most unmoved face lady clavering with a pair of bright black eyes and a good humoured countenance which waggled and nodded very graciously master francis clavering who was holding his mamma's skirt and who stopped the procession to look at the largest footman whose appearance seemed to strike the young gentleman and miss blandy governess to master francis and miss amory her ladyship's daughter giving her arm to captain strong <\s>
<s> it was summer but fires of welcome were crackling in the great hall chimney and in the rooms which the family were to occupy <\s>
<s> monsieur mirobolant had looked at the procession from one of the lime trees in the avenue <\s>
<s> elle est la he said laying his jewelled hand on his richly embroidered velvet glass buttons je t'ai vue je te benis o ma sylphide o mon ange <\s>
<s> and he dived into the thicket and made his way back to his furnaces and saucepans <\s>
<s> the next sunday the same party which had just made its appearance at clavering park came and publicly took possession of the ancient pew in the church where so many of the baronet's ancestors had prayed and were now kneeling in effigy <\s>
<s> there was such a run to see the new folks that the low church was deserted to the disgust of its pastor and as the state barouche with the greys and coachman in silver wig and solemn footmen drew up at the old churchyard gate there was such a crowd assembled there as had not been seen for many a long day <\s>
<s> captain strong knew everybody and saluted for all the company the country people vowed my lady was not handsome to be sure but pronounced her to be uncommon fine dressed as indeed she was with the finest of shawls the finest of pelisses the brilliantest of bonnets and wreaths and a power of rings cameos brooches chains bangles and other nameless gimcracks and ribbons of every breadth and colour of the rainbow flaming on her person <\s>
<s> miss amory appeared meek in dove colour like a vestal virgin while master francis was in the costume then prevalent of rob roy macgregor a celebrated highland outlaw <\s>
<s> the baronet was not more animated than ordinarily there was a happy vacuity about him which enabled him to face a dinner a death a church a marriage with the same indifferent ease <\s>
<s> a pew for the clavering servants was filled by these domestics and the enraptured congregation saw the gentlemen from london with vlower on their heeds and the miraculous coachman with his silver wig take their places in that pew so soon as his horses were put up at the clavering arms <\s>
<s> in the course of the service master francis began to make such a yelling in the pew that frederic the tallest of the footmen was beckoned by his master and rose and went and carried out master francis who roared and beat him on the head so that the powder flew round about like clouds of incense <\s>
<s> nor was he pacified until placed on the box of the carriage where he played at horses with john's whip <\s>
<s> you see the little beggar's never been to church before miss bell the baronet drawled out to a young lady who was visiting him no wonder he should make a row i don't go in town neither but i think it's right in the country to give a good example and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> miss bell laughed and said the little boy had not given a particularly good example <\s>
<s> gad i don't know and that sort of thing said the baronet <\s>
<s> it ain't so bad neither <\s>
<s> whenever he wants a thing frank always cwies and whenever he cwies he gets it <\s>
<s> here the child in question began to howl for a dish of sweetmeats on the luncheon table and making a lunge across the table cloth upset a glass of wine over the best waistcoat of one of the guests present mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis who was greatly annoyed at being made to look foolish and at having his spotless cambric shirt front blotched with wine <\s>
<s> we do spoil him so said lady clavering to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis finally gazing at the cherub whose hands and face were now frothed over with the species of lather which is inserted in the confection called meringues a la creme <\s>
<s> it is very wrong said mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis as if she had never done such a thing herself as spoil a child <\s>
<s> mamma says she spoils my brother do you think anything could miss bell <\s>
<s> look at him isn't he like a little angel <\s>
<s> gad i was quite wight said the baronet <\s>
<s> he has cwied and he has got it you see <\s>
<s> go it fwank old boy <\s>
<s> sir francis is a very judicious parent miss amory whispered <\s>
<s> don't you think so miss bell <\s>
<s> i shan't call you miss bell i shall call you laura <\s>
<s> i admired you so at church <\s>
<s> your robe was not well made nor your bonnet very fresh <\s>
<s> but you have such beautiful grey eyes and such a lovely tint <\s>
<s> thank you said miss bell laughing <\s>
<s> your cousin is handsome and thinks so <\s>
<s> he is uneasy de sa personne <\s>
<s> he has not seen the world yet <\s>
<s> a lady a little woman in a rumpled satin and velvet shoes a miss pybus came here and said he has suffered <\s>
<s> i too have suffered and you laura has your heart ever been touched <\s>
<s> but perhaps blushed a little at the idea or the question so that the other said ah laura <\s>
<s> i see it all <\s>
<s> it is the beau cousin <\s>
<s> i already love you as a sister <\s>
<s> you are very kind said miss bell smiling and and it must be owned that it is a very sudden attachment <\s>
<s> all attachments are so <\s>
<s> i knew i should love you from the moment i saw you <\s>
<s> do you not feel it yourself <\s>
