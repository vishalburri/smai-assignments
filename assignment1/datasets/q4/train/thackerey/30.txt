<s> get into my yellow i'll drop you at mudford where you have a chance of the fenbury mail <\s>
<s> i'll lend you a hat and a coat i've got lots <\s>
<s> come along jump in old boy go it leathers and in this way pen found himself in mr <\s>
<s> spavin's postchaise and rode with that gentleman as far as the ram inn at mudford fifteen miles from oxbridge where the fenbury mail changed horses and where pen got a place on to london <\s>
<s> the next day there was an immense excitement in boniface college oxbridge where for some time a rumour prevailed to the terror of pen's tutor and tradesmen that pendennis maddened at losing his degree had made away with himself a battered cap in which his name was almost discernible together with a seal bearing his crest of an eagle looking at a now extinct sun had been found three miles on the fenbury road near a mill stream and for four and twenty hours it was supposed that poor pen had flung himself into the stream until letters arrived from him bearing the london post mark <\s>
<s> the mail reached london at the dreary hour of five and he hastened to the inn at covent garden at which he was accustomed to put up where the ever wakeful porter admitted him and showed him to a bed <\s>
<s> pen looked hard at the man and wondered whether boots knew he was plucked <\s>
<s> when in bed he could not sleep there <\s>
<s> he tossed about until the appearance of the dismal london daylight when he sprang up desperately and walked off to his uncle's lodgings in bury street where the maid who was scouring the steps looked up suspiciously at him as he came with an unshaven face and yesterday's linen <\s>
<s> he thought she knew of his mishap too <\s>
<s> harthur what as appened sir <\s>
<s> morgan the valet asked who had just arranged the well brushed clothes and shiny boots at the door of his master's bedroom and was carrying in his wig to the major <\s>
<s> i want to see my uncle he cried in a ghastly voice and flung himself down on a chair <\s>
<s> morgan backed before the pale and desperate looking young man with terrified and wondering glances and disappeared in his master's apartment <\s>
<s> the major put his head out of the bedroom door as soon as he had his wig on <\s>
<s> senior wrangler double first class hay <\s>
<s> said the old gentleman i'll come directly and the head disappeared <\s>
<s> they don't know what has happened groaned pen what will they say when they know all <\s>
<s> pen had been standing with his back to the window and to such a dubious light as bury street enjoys of a foggy january morning so that his uncle could not see the expression of the young man's countenance or the looks of gloom and despair which even mr <\s>
<s> but when the major came out of his dressing room neat and radiant and preceded by faint odours from delcroix's shop from which emporium major pendennis's wig and his pocket handkerchief got their perfume he held out one of his hands to pen and was about addressing him in his cheery high toned voice when he caught sight of the boy's face at length and dropping his hand said good god <\s>
<s> pen what's the matter <\s>
<s> you'll see it in the papers at breakfast sir pen said <\s>
<s> my name isn't there sir <\s>
<s> hang it why should it be <\s>
<s> asked the major more perplexed <\s>
<s> i have lost everything sir pen groaned out my honour's gone i'm ruined irretrievably i can't go back to oxbridge <\s>
<s> screamed out the major <\s>
<s> you don't mean to say you have shown the white feather <\s>
<s> pen laughed bitterly at the word feather and repeated it <\s>
<s> no it isn't that sir <\s>
<s> i'm not afraid of being shot i wish to god anybody would <\s>
<s> i have not got my degree <\s>
<s> the major had heard of plucking but in a very vague and cursory way and concluded that it was some ceremony performed corporally upon rebellious university youth <\s>
<s> i wonder you can look me in the face after such a disgrace sir he said i wonder you submitted to it as a gentleman <\s>
<s> i couldn't help it sir <\s>
<s> i did my classical papers well enough it was those infernal mathematics which i have always neglected <\s>
<s> was it was it done in public sir <\s>
<s> asked the guardian looking pen anxiously in the face <\s>
<s> pen perceived the error under which his guardian was labouring and in the midst of his misery the blunder caused the poor wretch a faint smile and served to bring down the conversation from the tragedy key in which pen had been disposed to carry it on <\s>
<s> he explained to his uncle that he had gone in to pass his examination and failed <\s>
<s> on which the major said that though he had expected far better things of his nephew there was no great misfortune in this and no dishonour as far as he saw and that pen must try again <\s>
<s> me again at oxbridge pen thought after such a humiliation as that <\s>
<s> he felt that except he went down to burn the place he could not enter it <\s>
<s> but it was when he came to tell his uncle of his debts that the other felt surprise and anger most keenly and broke out in speeches most severe upon pen which the lad bore as best might without flinching <\s>
<s> he had determined to make a clean breast and had formed a full true and complete list of all his bills and liabilities at the university and in london <\s>
<s> they consisted of various items such as london tailor <\s>
<s> haberdasher for shirts and gloves <\s>
<s> hotel bill in london <\s>
<s> wine merchant in london <\s>
<s> all which items the reader may fill in at his pleasure such accounts have been inspected by the parents of many university youth and it appeared that mr <\s>
<s> pen's bills in all amounted to about seven hundred pounds and furthermore it was calculated that he had had more than twice that sum of ready money during his stay at oxbridge <\s>
<s> this sum he had spent and for it had to show what <\s>
<s> you need not press a man who is down sir pen said to his uncle gloomily <\s>
<s> i know very well sir how wicked and idle i have been <\s>
<s> my mother won't like to see me dishonoured sir he continued with his voice failing and i know she will pay these accounts <\s>
<s> but i shall ask her for no more money <\s>
<s> as you like sir the major said <\s>
<s> you are of age and my hands are washed of your affairs <\s>
<s> but you can't live without money and have no means of making it that i see though you have a fine talent in spending it and it is my belief that you will proceed as you have begun and ruin your mother before you are five years older good morning it is time for me to go to breakfast <\s>
<s> my engagements won't permit me to see you much during the time that you stay in london <\s>
<s> i presume that you will acquaint your mother with the news which you have just conveyed to me <\s>
