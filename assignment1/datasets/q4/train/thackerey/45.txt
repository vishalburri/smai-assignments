<s> and so talking the friends turned into their chambers as the dawn was beginning to peep <\s>
<s> poor cos's ditty the little doodeen which bows accompanied charmingly on the piano was sung but to a few admirers who might choose to remain after the tremendous resurrectionist chant <\s>
<s> the room was commonly emptied after that or only left in possession of a very few and persevering votaries of pleasure <\s>
<s> whilst pen and his friend were sitting here together one night or rather morning two habitues of the house entered almost together <\s>
<s> doolan whispered warrington to pen saluting these gentlemen and in the latter pen recognised his friend of the alacrity coach who could not dine with pen on the day on which the latter had invited him being compelled by his professional duties to decline dinner engagements on fridays he had stated with his compliments to mr <\s>
<s> doolan's paper the dawn was lying on the table much bestained by porter and cheek by jowl with hoolan's paper which we shall call the day the dawn was liberal the day was ultra conservative <\s>
<s> many of our journals are officered by irish gentlemen and their gallant brigade does the penning among us as their ancestors used to transact the fighting in europe and engage under many a flag to be good friends when the battle is over <\s>
<s> kidneys john and a glass of stout says hoolan <\s>
<s> how are you morgan <\s>
<s> doing pretty well thank ye mick my boy faith she's accustomed to it said doolan <\s>
<s> how's the lady that owns ye <\s>
<s> maybe i'll step down sunday and have a glass of punch kilburn way <\s>
<s> don't bring patsey with you mick for our georgy's got the measles said the friendly morgan and they straightway fell to talk about matters connected with their trade about the foreign mails about who was correspondent at paris and who wrote from madrid about the expense the morning journal was at in sending couriers about the circulation of the evening star and so forth <\s>
<s> warrington laughing took the dawn which was lying before him and pointed to one of the leading articles in that journal which commenced thus as rogues of note in former days who had some wicked work to perform an enemy to be put out of the way a quantity of false coin to be passed a lie to be told or a murder to be done employed a professional perjurer or assassin to do the work which they were themselves too notorious or too cowardly to execute our notorious contemporary the day engages smashers out of doors to utter forgeries against individuals and calls in auxiliary cut throats to murder the reputation of those who offend him <\s>
<s> a black vizarded ruffian whom we will unmask who signs the forged name of trefoil is at present one of the chief bravoes and bullies in our contemporary's establishment <\s>
<s> he is the eunuch who brings the bowstring and strangles at the order of the day <\s>
<s> we can convict this cowardly slave and propose to do so <\s>
<s> the charge which he has brought against lord bangbanagher because he is a liberal irish peer and against the board of poor law guardians of the bangbanagher union is etc <\s>
<s> how did they like the article at your place mick <\s>
<s> asked morgan when the captain puts his hand to it he's a tremendous hand at a smasher <\s>
<s> he wrote the article in two hours in whew you know where while the boy was waiting <\s>
<s> our governor thinks the public don't mind a straw about these newspaper rows and has told the docthor to stop answering said the other <\s>
<s> them two talked it out together in my room <\s>
<s> the docthor would have liked a turn for he says it's such easy writing and requires no reading up of a subject but the governor put a stopper on him <\s>
<s> the taste for eloquence is going out mick said morgan <\s>
<s> deed then it is morgan said mick <\s>
<s> that was fine writing when the docthor wrote in the phaynix and he and condy roony blazed away at each other day after day <\s>
<s> and with powder and shot too as well as paper says morgan faith the docthor was out twice and condy roony winged his man <\s>
<s> they are talking about doctor boyne and captain shandon warrington said who are the two irish controversialists of the dawn and the day dr <\s>
<s> boyne being the protestant champion and captain shandon the liberal orator <\s>
<s> they are the best friends in the world i believe in spite of their newspaper controversies and though they cry out against the english for abusing their country by jove they abuse it themselves more in a single article than we should take the pains to do in a dozen volumes <\s>
<s> how are you doolan <\s>
<s> pendennis i am delighted to have the honour of seeing ye again <\s>
<s> the night's journey on the top of the alacrity was one of the most agreeable i ever enjoyed in my life and it was your liveliness and urbanity that made the trip so charming <\s>
<s> i have often thought over that happy night sir and talked over it to mrs <\s>
<s> i have seen your elegant young friend mr <\s>
<s> foker too here sir not unfrequently <\s>
<s> he is an occasional frequenter of this hostelry and a right good one it is <\s>
<s> pendennis when i saw you i was on the tom and jerry weekly paper i have now the honour to be sub editor of the dawn one of the best written papers of the empire and he bowed very slightly to mr <\s>
<s> his speech was unctuous and measured his courtesy oriental his tone when talking with the two englishmen quite different to that with which he spoke to his comrade <\s>
<s> why the devil will the fellow compliment so <\s>
<s> growled warrington with a sneer which he hardly took the pains to suppress <\s>
<s> psha who comes here all parnassus is abroad to night here's archer <\s>
<s> we shall have some fun <\s>
<s> well archer house up <\s>
<s> i have been said archer with an air of mystery where i was wanted <\s>

<s> if it had been at apsley house it would have been quite different <\s>
<s> the duke knows what i like and says to the groom of the chambers martin you will have some cold beef not too much done and a pint bottle of pale ale and some brown sherry ready in my study as usual archer is coming here this evening <\s>
<s> the duke doesn't eat supper himself but he likes to see a man enjoy a hearty meal and he knows that i dine early <\s>
<s> a man can't live upon air be hanged to him <\s>

<s> we were four the french ambassador steyne and we two commoners <\s>
<s> why my uncle is in scot pen was going to break out but warrington pressed his foot under the table as a signal for him to be quiet <\s>
<s> it was about the same business that i have been to the palace to night archer went on simply and where i've been kept four hours in an anteroom with nothing but yesterday's times which i knew by heart as i wrote three of the leading articles myself and though the lord chamberlain came in four times and once holding the royal teacup and saucer in his hand he did not so much as say to me archer will you have a cup of tea indeed <\s>
<s> what is in the wind now <\s>
<s> asked warrington and turning to pen added you know i suppose that when there is anything wrong at court they always send for archer <\s>
<s> there is something wrong said mr <\s>
<s> archer and as the story will be all over the town in a day or two i don't mind telling it <\s>
<s> at the last chantilly races where i rode brian boru for my old friend the duke de saint cloud the old king said to me archer i'm uneasy about saint cloud <\s>
<s> i have arranged his marriage with the princess marie cunegonde the peace of europe depends upon it for russia will declare war if the marriage does not take place and the young fool is so mad about madame massena marshal massena's wife that he actually refuses to be a party to the marriage <\s>
<s> well sir i spoke to saint cloud and having got him into pretty good humour by winning the race and a good bit of money into the bargain he said to me archer tell the governor i'll think of it how do you say governor in french <\s>
<s> asked pen who piqued himself on knowing that language <\s>
<s> oh we speak in english i taught him when we were boys and i saved his life at twickenham when he fell out of a punt archer said <\s>
<s> i shall never forget the queen's looks as i brought him out of the water <\s>
<s> she gave me this diamond ring and always calls me charles to this day <\s>
<s> madame massena must be rather an old woman archer warrington said <\s>
<s> dev'lish old old enough to be his grandmother i told him so archer answered at once <\s>
<s> but those attachments for old women are the deuce and all <\s>
<s> that's what the king feels that's what shocks the poor queen so much <\s>
<s> they went away from paris last tuesday night and are living at this present moment at jaunay's hotel <\s>
<s> has there been a private marriage archer <\s>
<s> whether there has or not i don't know mr <\s>
<s> archer replied all i know is that i was kept waiting for four hours at the palace that i never saw a man in such a state of agitation as the king of belgium when he came out to speak to me and that i'm devilish hungry and here comes some supper <\s>
<s> he has been pretty well to night said warrington as the pair went home together but i have known him in much greater force and keeping a whole room in a state of wonder <\s>
<s> put aside his archery practice that man is both able and honest a good man of business an excellent friend admirable to his family as husband father and son <\s>
<s> what is it makes him pull the long bow in that wonderful manner <\s>
<s> an amiable insanity answered warrington <\s>
<s> he never did anybody harm by his talk or said evil of anybody <\s>
<s> he is a stout politician too and would never write a word or do an act against his party as many of us do <\s>
<s> of what profession is mr <\s>
<s> of the corporation of the goosequill of the press my boy said warrington of the fourth estate <\s>
