<s> it's not going to make any difference is it <\s>
<s> you know it is <\s>
<s> sins of the fathers <\s>
<s> unto the third and fourth generations <\s>

<s> none in a way only i've often told you i don't see why you should treat us as outsiders <\s>
<s> we don't like it <\s>
<s> well you shouldn't be then i mean he shouldn't be <\s>
<s> father's just as human as your father he's wrapped up in us and all his getting on is for us <\s>
<s> would you like to be treated as your mother treated chloe <\s>
<s> your mother's set the stroke for the other big wigs about here nobody calls on chloe <\s>
<s> i think it's contemptible to bar people just because they're new as you call it and have to make their position instead of having it left them <\s>
<s> it's not because they're new it's because if your father behaved like a gentleman he'd be treated like one <\s>
<s> i don't believe it <\s>
<s> my father's a very able man he thinks he's entitled to have influence here <\s>
<s> well everybody tries to keep him down <\s>
<s> that makes him mad and more determined than ever to get his way <\s>
<s> you ought to be just jill <\s>
<s> besides what's it got to do with charlie and chloe <\s>
<s> it's pretty sickening for her <\s>
<s> father didn't expect people to call until charlie married but since jill <\s>
<s> i think it's all very petty <\s>
<s> it is a dog in the manger business i did think you were above it <\s>
<s> how would you like to have your home spoiled <\s>
<s> i'm not going to argue <\s>
