<s> the men are here too sir <\s>
<s> underwood goes to the door returning with harness a pale clean shaven man with hollow cheeks quick eyes and lantern jaw frost has retired underwood <\s>
<s> scantlebury pained you don't say <\s>
<s> we shall never got it back <\s>
<s> who'd have supposed the men were going to stick out like this nobody suggested that <\s>
<s> looking angrily at tench scantlebury <\s>
<s> shaking his head i've never liked a fight never shall <\s>
<s> all look at him wilder <\s>
<s> who wants to surrender <\s>
<s> anthony looks at him i i want to act reasonably <\s>
<s> when the men sent roberts up to the board in december then was the time <\s>
<s> we ought to have humoured him instead of that the chairman dropping his eyes before anthony's er we snapped his head off <\s>
<s> we could have got them in then by a little tact <\s>
<s> this strike's been going on now since october and as far as i can see it may last another six months <\s>
<s> pretty mess we shall be in by then <\s>
<s> the only comfort is the men'll be in a worse <\s>
<s> to underwood what sort of state are they really in frank <\s>
<s> well who on earth would have thought they'd have held on like this without support <\s>
<s> those who know them <\s>
<s> i defy any one to know them <\s>
<s> and what about tin <\s>
<s> price going up daily <\s>
<s> when we do get started we shall have to work off our contracts at the top of the market <\s>
<s> what do you say to that chairman <\s>
<s> shan't pay a dividend till goodness knows when <\s>
<s> with emphasis we ought to think of the shareholders <\s>
<s> turning heavily chairman i say we ought to think of the shareholders <\s>
<s> the chairman says he is thinking of you sir <\s>
<s> sinking back into torpor cynic <\s>
<s> it's past a joke <\s>
<s> i don't want to go without a dividend for years if the chairman does <\s>
<s> we can't go on playing ducks and drakes with the company's prosperity <\s>
<s> rather ashamedly i think we ought to consider the men <\s>
<s> all but anthony fidget in their seats scantlebury <\s>
<s> with a sigh we must n't think of our private feelings young man <\s>
<s> ironically i'm not thinking of our feelings <\s>
<s> i'm thinking of the men's <\s>
<s> as to that we're men of business <\s>
<s> that is the little trouble <\s>
<s> there's no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of all this suffering it's it's cruel <\s>
<s> no one speaks as though edgar had uncovered something whose existence no man prizing his self respect could afford to recognise wanklin <\s>
<s> with an ironical smile i'm afraid we must n't base our policy on luxuries like sentiment <\s>
<s> i detest this state of things <\s>
<s> we did n't seek the quarrel <\s>
<s> i know that sir but surely we've gone far enough <\s>
<s> all look at one another wanklin <\s>
<s> luxuries apart chairman we must look out what we're doing <\s>
<s> give way to the men once and there'll be no end to it <\s>
<s> i quite agree but anthony shakes his head you make it a question of bedrock principle <\s>
<s> anthony nods luxuries again chairman <\s>
<s> the shares are below par <\s>
<s> yes and they'll drop to a half when we pass the next dividend <\s>
<s> with alarm come come <\s>
<s> not so bad as that <\s>
<s> craning forward to catch anthony's speech i didn't catch tench <\s>
<s> hesitating the chairman says sir fais que que devra <\s>
<s> sharply my father says do what we ought and let things rip <\s>
<s> throwing up his hands the chairman's a stoic i always said the chairman was a stoic <\s>
<s> much good that'll do us <\s>
<s> suavely seriously chairman are you going to let the ship sink under you for the sake of a principle <\s>
<s> with alarm not while i'm on the board i hope <\s>
<s> with a twinkle better rat scantlebury <\s>
<s> i've always fought them i've never been beaten yet <\s>
<s> we're with you in theory chairman <\s>
<s> but we're not all made of cast iron <\s>
<s> we've only to hold on <\s>
<s> rising and going to the fire and go to the devil as fast as we can <\s>
<s> better go to the devil than give in <\s>
<s> fretfully that may suit you sir but it does n't suit me or any one else i should think <\s>
<s> anthony looks him in the face a silence edgar <\s>
<s> i don't see how we can get over it that to go on like this means starvation to the men's wives and families <\s>
<s> wilder turns abruptly to the fire and scantlebury puts out a hand to push the idea away wanklin <\s>
<s> i'm afraid again that sounds a little sentimental <\s>
<s> men of business are excused from decency you think <\s>
<s> nobody's more sorry for the men than i am but if they lashing himself choose to be such a pig headed lot it's nothing to do with us we've quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves and the shareholders <\s>
<s> irritably it won't kill the shareholders to miss a dividend or two i don't see that that's reason enough for knuckling under <\s>
<s> with grave discomfort you talk very lightly of your dividends young man i don't know where we are <\s>
<s> there's only one sound way of looking at it <\s>
<s> we can't go on ruining ourselves with this strike <\s>
<s> with a gesture of despair look at him <\s>
<s> anthony's leaning back in his chair <\s>
<s> they do look at him wilder <\s>
<s> returning to his seat well all i can say is if that's the chairman's view i don't know what we've come down here for <\s>
<s> to tell the men that we've got nothing for them grimly they won't believe it till they hear it spoken in plain english <\s>
<s> shouldn't be a bit surprised if that brute roberts had n't got us down here with the very same idea <\s>
<s> i hate a man with a grievance <\s>
<s> resentfully we didn't pay him enough for his discovery <\s>
<s> i always said that at the time <\s>
<s> we paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three years later <\s>
<s> if that's not enough <\s>
<s> what does he want for goodness sake <\s>
<s> complainingly company made a hundred thousand out of his brains and paid him seven hundred that's the way he goes on sir <\s>
<s> the man's a rank agitator <\s>
<s> look here i hate the unions <\s>
<s> but now we've got harness here let's get him to settle the whole thing <\s>
<s> again they look at him underwood <\s>
<s> roberts won't let the men assent to that <\s>
<s> looking at anthony and not the only one <\s>
<s> frost enters from the hall frost <\s>
<s> harness from the union waiting sir <\s>
<s> the men are here too sir <\s>
<s> underwood goes to the door returning with harness a pale clean shaven man with hollow cheeks quick eyes and lantern jaw frost has retired underwood <\s>
