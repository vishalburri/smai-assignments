<s> i'll see to that <\s>
<s> ivy looks at her as if she would speak again then turns suddenly and goes out <\s>
<s> beatrice's face darkens she shivers <\s>
<s> taking out a little cigarette case she lights a cigarette and watches the puff's of smoke wreathe shout her and die away <\s>
<s> the frightened mercy peers out spying for a chance to escape <\s>
<s> then from the house strangway comes in <\s>
<s> all his dreaminess is gone strangway <\s>
<s> he stops at the look on her face i don't understand though <\s>
<s> i thought you were still out there <\s>

<s> it's no good michael i've tried and tried <\s>
<s> you said when you were right away i've waited beatrice <\s>
<s> but i told you not to hope michael <\s>
<s> i've done my best <\s>
<s> all these months at mentone i've been wondering why i ever let you marry me when that feeling wasn't dead <\s>

<s> they don't know me there <\s>
<s> i told you not to hope michael <\s>
<s> i've done my best i swear it <\s>
<s> it was your god that brought us to live near him <\s>
<s> why have you come to me like this <\s>

<s> beatrice bends her head never loved me <\s>
<s> not that night on the river not <\s>
<s> under her breath no <\s>
<s> were you lying to me then <\s>
<s> kissing me and hating me <\s>
<s> one doesn't hate men like you but it wasn't love <\s>
<s> why did you tell me it was <\s>
<s> that was the worst thing i've ever done <\s>
<s> do you think i would have married you <\s>
<s> i would have burned first <\s>
<s> i never dreamed you didn't <\s>
<s> very low forget it <\s>
<s> did he try to get you away from me <\s>
<s> beatrice gives him a swift look tell me the truth <\s>
<s> one does not easily know love it seems <\s>
<s> but her smile faint mysterious pitying is enough and he turns away from her beatrice <\s>
<s> it was cruel to come i know <\s>
<s> but i couldn't write <\s>
<s> i had to know <\s>
<s> that night at tregaron <\s>
<s> at the look on her face you might have told me before you went away <\s>
<s> why keep me all these beatrice <\s>
<s> i meant to forget him again <\s>
<s> i did mean to <\s>
<s> i thought i could get back to what i was when i married you but you see what a girl can do a woman that's been married can't <\s>
<s> then it was i my kisses that <\s>
<s> he laughs how did you stand them <\s>
<s> his eyes dart at her face imagination helped you perhaps <\s>
<s> don't make a public thing of it <\s>
<s> you needn't be afraid i shall have too good a time <\s>
<s> he stays quite still and silent and that which is writhing in him makes his face so strange that beatrice stands aghast <\s>
<s> at last she goes stumbling on in speech if ever you want to marry some one else then of course that's only fair ruin or not <\s>
<s> but till then till then  he's leaving durford going to brighton <\s>
<s> no one need know <\s>
<s> and you this isn't the only parish in the world <\s>
<s> quietly you ask me to help you live in secret with another man <\s>
<s> i ask for mercy <\s>
<s> as to himself what am i to do <\s>
