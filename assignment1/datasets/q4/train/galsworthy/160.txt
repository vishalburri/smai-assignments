<s> yes with an aitch <\s>
<s> there's a balance abart im that i like <\s>
<s> there's no doubt the christian religion went too far <\s>
<s> turn the other cheek <\s>
<s> an this anti christ neesha what came in with the war he went too far in the other direction <\s>
<s> neither of em practical men <\s>
<s> you've got to strike a balance and foller it <\s>
<s> not much balance about us <\s>
<s> we just run about and jump jim crow <\s>
<s> with a perfunctory wipe that's right we aven't got a faith these days <\s>
<s> but what's the use of tellin the englishman to act like an angel <\s>
<s> he ain't either an angel or a blond beast <\s>
<s> he's between the two an ermumphradite <\s>
<s> take my daughter  if i was a blond beast i'd turn er out to starve if i was an angel i'd starve meself to learn her the piano <\s>
<s> i don't do either <\s>
<s> becos my instincts tells me not <\s>
<s> yes but my doubt is whether our instincts at this moment of the world's history are leading us up or down <\s>
<s> what is up and what is down <\s>
<s> can you answer me that <\s>
<s> is it up or down to get so soft that you can't take care of yourself <\s>
<s> well is it up or down to get so ard that you can't take care of others <\s>
<s> well there you are <\s>
<s> then our instincts are taking us down <\s>
<s> they're strikin a balance unbeknownst all the time <\s>
<s> you're a philosopher mr bly <\s>
<s> modestly well i do a bit in that line too <\s>
<s> in my opinion nature made the individual believe he's goin to live after'e's dead just to keep im livin while es alive otherwise he'd a died out <\s>
<s> quite a thought quite a thought <\s>
<s> but i go one better than nature <\s>
<s> follow your instincts is my motto <\s>
<s> excuse me mr bly i think nature got hold of that before you <\s>
<s> slightly chilled well i'm keepin you <\s>
<s> you're a believer in conscience or the little voice within <\s>
<s> when my son was very small his mother asked him once if he didn't hear a little voice within telling him what was right <\s>
<s> mr march touches his diaphragm and he said i often hear little voices in here but they never say anything <\s>
<s> mr bly cannot laugh but he smiles mary johnny must have been awfully like the government <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact i've got my daughter here in obeyance <\s>
<s> your cook told me you couldn't get hold of an ouse parlour maid <\s>
<s> so i thought it was just a chance you bein broadminded <\s>
<s> what would your mother say mary <\s>
<s> mother would say has she had experience <\s>
<s> i've told you about her experience <\s>
<s> yes but as a parlour maid <\s>
<s> she can do hair <\s>
<s> observing the smile exchanged between mr march and mary and she's quite handy with a plate <\s>
<s> tentatively i'm a little afraid my wife would feel bly <\s>
<s> you see in this weavin shop all the girls ave ad to be in trouble otherwise they wouldn't take em <\s>
<s> apologetically towards mary it's a kind of a disorderly ouse without the disorders <\s>
<s> excusin the young lady's presence <\s>
