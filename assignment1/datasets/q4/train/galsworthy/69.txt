<s> i am not to blame for that monsieur <\s>
<s> it had well begun before i knew her <\s>
<s> yes yes i was afraid of it at the time <\s>
<s> megan turns silently and slips away feerrand <\s>
<s> i do my best for her monsieur but look at me <\s>
<s> besides i am not good for her it is not good for simple souls to be with those who see things clear <\s>
<s> for the great part of mankind to see anything is fatal <\s>
<s> even for you it seems <\s>
<s> to be so near to death has done me good i shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave <\s>
<s> since i saw you monsieur i have been in three institutions <\s>
<s> one may eat upon the floor though it is true for kings they eat too much of skilly there <\s>
<s> one little thing they lack those palaces <\s>
<s> it is understanding of the uman heart <\s>
<s> in them tame birds pluck wild birds naked <\s>
<s> monsieur i am loafer waster what you like for all that bitterly poverty is my only crime <\s>
<s> if i were rich should i not be simply veree original ighly respected with soul above commerce travelling to see the world <\s>
<s> and that young girl would she not be that charming ladee veree chic you know <\s>
<s> and the old tims good old fashioned gentleman drinking his liquor well <\s>
<s> bien what are we now <\s>
<s> dark beasts despised by all <\s>
<s> that is life monsieur <\s>
<s> he stares into the fire wellwyn <\s>
<s> we're our own enemies ferrand <\s>
<s> i can afford it you can't <\s>
<s> earnestly monsieur do you know this <\s>
<s> you are the sole being that can do us good we hopeless ones <\s>
<s> shaking his head not a bit of it i'm hopeless too <\s>
<s> eagerly monsieur it is just that <\s>
<s> when we are with you we feel something here he touches his heart if i had one prayer to make it would be good god give me to understand <\s>
<s> those sirs with their theories they can clean our skins and chain our abits that soothes for them the aesthetic sense it gives them too their good little importance <\s>
<s> but our spirits they cannot touch for they nevare understand <\s>
<s> without that monsieur all is dry as a parched skin of orange <\s>
<s> don't be so bitter <\s>
<s> think of all the work they do <\s>
<s> monsieur of their industry i say nothing <\s>
<s> they do a good work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old and the good unfortunate deserving <\s>
<s> above all to the little children <\s>
<s> but monsieur when all is done there are always us hopeless ones <\s>
<s> what can they do with me monsieur with that girl or with that old man <\s>
<s> monsieur we too ave our qualities we others it wants you courage to undertake a career like mine or like that young girl's <\s>
<s> we wild ones we know a thousand times more of life than ever will those sirs <\s>
<s> they waste their time trying to make rooks white <\s>
<s> be kind to us if you will or let us alone like mees ann but do not try to change our skins <\s>
