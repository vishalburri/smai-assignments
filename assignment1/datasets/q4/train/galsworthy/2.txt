<s> he produces money here is eight pounds the extra will cover the value of the purse and your cab fares <\s>
<s> i need make no comment no thanks are necessary <\s>

<s> you you're one of those who are a nuisance to society you you're dangerous <\s>
<s> what your mother would say i don't know <\s>
<s> your conduct as far as i can see is absolutely unjustifiable <\s>
<s> why a poor man who behaved as you've done d you think he'd have any mercy shown him <\s>
<s> what you want is a good lesson <\s>
<s> you and your sort are he speaks with feeling a nuisance to the community <\s>
<s> don't ask me to help you next time <\s>
<s> you're not fit to be helped <\s>
<s> turning upon his sire with unexpected fierceness all right i won't then and see how you like it <\s>
<s> you would n't have helped me this time i know if you had n't been scared the thing would get into the papers <\s>
<s> where are the cigarettes <\s>
<s> regarding him uneasily well i ll say no more about it <\s>

<s> none of the windows open <\s>
<s> quietly to jack you left your latch key in the door last night sir <\s>

<s> have you any suspicions <\s>
<s> jones how long has she been working here <\s>
<s> only this last month sir <\s>
<s> what sort of person <\s>
<s> i don't know much about her sir seems a very quiet respectable woman <\s>
<s> who did the room this morning <\s>
<s> with his forefinger upraised now was this mrs <\s>
<s> jones in the room alone at any time <\s>
<s> how do you know that <\s>
<s> reluctantly i found her here sir <\s>

<s> i believe not sir <\s>
<s> say nothing about it to any one <\s>

<s> barthwick and hey son come in barthwick <\s>
<s> well my dear you've not seen it i suppose <\s>
<s> but what an extraordinary thing john <\s>
<s> marlow of course is out of the question <\s>
