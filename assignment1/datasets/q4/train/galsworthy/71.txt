<s> act i it is half past nine of a july evening <\s>
<s> in a dining room lighted by sconces and apparelled in wall paper carpet and curtains of deep vivid blue the large french windows between two columns are open on to a wide terrace beyond which are seen trees in darkness and distant shapes of lighted houses <\s>
<s> on one side is a bay window over which curtains are partly drawn <\s>
<s> opposite to this window is a door leading into the hall <\s>
<s> at an oval rosewood table set with silver flowers fruit and wine six people are seated after dinner <\s>
<s> back to the bay window is stephen more the host a man of forty with a fine cut face a rather charming smile and the eyes of an idealist to his right sir john julian an old soldier with thin brown features and grey moustaches to sir john's right his brother the dean of stour a tall dark ascetic looking churchman to his right katherine is leaning forward her elbows on the table and her chin on her hands staring across at her husband to her right sits edward mendip a pale man of forty five very bald with a fine forehead and on his clear cut lips a smile that shows his teeth between him and more is helen julian a pretty dark haired young woman absorbed in thoughts of her own <\s>
<s> the voices are tuned to the pitch of heated discussion as the curtain rises <\s>
<s> i disagree with you stephen absolutely entirely disagree <\s>
<s> i can't help it <\s>
<s> remember a certain war stephen <\s>
<s> were your chivalrous notions any good then <\s>
<s> and what was winked at in an obscure young member is anathema for an under secretary of state <\s>
<s> you can't afford more <\s>
<s> to follow my conscience <\s>
<s> idealism can be out of place my friend <\s>
<s> the government is dealing here with a wild lawless race on whom i must say i think sentiment is rather wasted <\s>
<s> god made them dean <\s>
<s> i have my doubts <\s>
<s> they have proved themselves faithless <\s>
<s> we have the right to chastise <\s>
<s> if i hit a little man in the eye and he hits me back have i the right to chastise him <\s>
<s> we didn't begin this business <\s>
<s> with our missionaries and our trading <\s>
<s> it is news indeed that the work of civilization may be justifiably met by murder <\s>
<s> have you forgotten glaive and morlinson <\s>
<s> and that poor fellow groome and his wife <\s>
<s> they went into a wild country against the feeling of the tribes on their own business <\s>
<s> what has the nation to do with the mishaps of gamblers <\s>
<s> we can't stand by and see our own flesh and blood ill treated <\s>
<s> does our rule bring blessing or does it not stephen <\s>
<s> sometimes but with all my soul i deny the fantastic superstition that our rule can benefit a people like this a nation of one race as different from ourselves as dark from light in colour religion every mortal thing <\s>
<s> we can only pervert their natural instincts <\s>
<s> that to me is an unintelligible point of view <\s>
<s> go into that philosophy of yours a little deeper stephen it spells stagnation <\s>
<s> there are no fixed stars on this earth <\s>
<s> nations can't let each other alone <\s>
<s> big ones could let little ones alone <\s>
<s> if they could there'd be no big ones <\s>
<s> my dear fellow we know little nations are your hobby but surely office should have toned you down <\s>
<s> i've served my country fifty years and i say she is not in the wrong <\s>
<s> i hope to serve her fifty sir john and i say she is <\s>
<s> there are moments when such things can't be said more <\s>
<s> they'll be said by me to night mendip <\s>
<s> more you mustn't let him <\s>
<s> rising you can tell people that to morrow mendip <\s>
<s> give it a leader in the parthenon <\s>
<s> no man in your position has a right to fly out like this at the eleventh hour <\s>
<s> i've made no secret of my feelings all along <\s>
<s> i'm against this war and against the annexation we all know it will lead to <\s>
<s> don't be so quixotic <\s>
<s> we shall have war within the next twenty four hours and nothing you can do will stop it <\s>
<s> i'm afraid so mrs <\s>
<s> not a doubt of it helen <\s>
<s> to more and you mean to charge the windmill <\s>
<s> i'm not out for advertisement <\s>
<s> you will get it <\s>
<s> must speak the truth sometimes even at that risk <\s>
<s> it is not the truth <\s>
<s> the greater the truth the greater the libel and the greater the resentment of the person libelled <\s>
<s> trying to bring matters to a blander level my dear stephen even if you were right which i deny about the initial merits there surely comes a point where the individual conscience must resign it self to the country's feeling <\s>
<s> this has become a question of national honour <\s>
<s> nations are bad judges of their honour dean <\s>
<s> i shall not follow you there <\s>
<s> it's an awkward word <\s>
<s> stopping the dean uncle james <\s>
<s> more looks at her intently sir john <\s>
