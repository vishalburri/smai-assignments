<s> we shall have to charge him with the assault sir <\s>
<s> it would be as well for your son to come down to the court <\s>
<s> there'll be a remand no doubt <\s>
<s> the queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him and a crimson silk purse <\s>
<s> barthwick starts jack rises and sits dozen again i suppose the lady has n't missed her purse <\s>
<s> to snow i ve been inquiring of the servants <\s>
<s> this man does hang about the house <\s>
<s> i shall feel much safer if he gets a good long sentence i do think we ought to be protected against such ruffians <\s>
<s> yes yes of course on principle but in this case we have a number of things to think of <\s>
<s> to snow i suppose as you say the man must be charged eh <\s>
<s> no question about that sir <\s>
<s> staring gloomily at jack this prosecution goes very much against the grain with me <\s>
<s> i have great sympathy with the poor <\s>
<s> in my position i m bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them <\s>
<s> the condition of the people leaves much to be desired <\s>
<s> d you follow me <\s>
<s> i wish i could see my way to drop it <\s>
<s> it's simply not fair to other people <\s>
<s> it's putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to take it <\s>
<s> trying to make signs to her aside i m not defending him not at all <\s>
<s> i'm trying to look at the matter broadly <\s>
<s> nonsense john there's a time for everything <\s>
<s> rather sardonically i might point out sir that to withdraw the charge of stealing would not make much difference because the facts must come out he looks significantly at jack in reference to the assault and as i said that charge will have to go forward <\s>
<s> it's entirely on the woman's account entirely a matter of my own private feelings <\s>
<s> if i were you sir i should let things take their course <\s>
<s> it's not likely there'll be much difficulty <\s>
<s> these things are very quick settled <\s>
<s> doubtfully you think so you think so <\s>
<s> rousing himself i say what shall i have to swear to <\s>
<s> that's best known to yourself sir <\s>
<s> retreating to the door better employ a solicitor sir in case anything should arise <\s>
<s> we shall have the butler to prove the loss of the article <\s>
<s> you'll excuse me going i m rather pressed to night <\s>
<s> the case may come on any time after eleven <\s>
<s> good evening sir good evening ma'am <\s>
<s> i shall have to produce the box in court to morrow so if you'll excuse me sir i may as well take it with me <\s>
<s> he takes the silver box and leaves them with a little bow barthwick makes a move to follow him then dashing his hands beneath his coat tails speaks with desperation barthwick <\s>
<s> i do wish you'd leave me to manage things myself <\s>
<s> you will put your nose into matters you know nothing of <\s>
<s> a pretty mess you've made of this <\s>
<s> coldly i don't in the least know what you're talking about <\s>
<s> if you can't stand up for your rights i can <\s>
<s> i ve no patience with your principles it's such nonsense <\s>
<s> what have principles to do with it for goodness sake <\s>
<s> don't you know that jack was drunk last night <\s>
<s> in horror rising jack <\s>
<s> look here mother i had supper <\s>
<s> i mean to say you know what i mean it's absurd to call it being drunk <\s>
<s> at oxford everybody gets a bit on sometimes mrs <\s>
<s> well i think it's most dreadful <\s>
<s> if that is really what you do at oxford <\s>
<s> angrily well why did you send me there <\s>
<s> one must do as other fellows do <\s>
<s> it's such nonsense i mean to call it being drunk <\s>
<s> of course i m awfully sorry <\s>
<s> i ve had such a beastly headache all day <\s>
<s> if you'd only had the common decency to remember what happened when you came in <\s>
<s> then we should know what truth there was in what this fellow says as it is it's all the most confounded darkness <\s>
<s> staring as though at half formed visions i just get a and then it s gone mrs <\s>
<s> do you mean to say you were so tipsy you can't even remember jack <\s>
<s> of course i remember i came i must have come barthwick <\s>
<s> unguardedly and walking up and down tcha and that infernal purse <\s>
<s> it'll get into the papers <\s>
<s> who on earth could have foreseen a thing like this <\s>
<s> better to have lost a dozen cigarette boxes and said nothing about it <\s>
<s> to his wife it's all your doing <\s>
<s> i told you so from the first <\s>
<s> i wish to goodness roper would come <\s>
<s> sharply i don't know what you're talking about john <\s>
<s> turning on her no you you you don't know anything <\s>
<s> sharply where the devil is roper <\s>
<s> if he can see a way out of this he's a better man than i take him for <\s>
<s> i defy any one to see a way out of it <\s>
<s> look here don't excite dad i can simply say i was too beastly tired and don't remember anything except that i came in and in a dying voice went to bed the same as usual <\s>
<s> who knows where you went i ve lost all confidence <\s>
<s> for all i know you slept on the floor <\s>
<s> indignantly i did n't i slept on the barthwick <\s>
<s> sitting on the sofa who cares where you slept what does it matter if he mentions the the a perfect disgrace <\s>
