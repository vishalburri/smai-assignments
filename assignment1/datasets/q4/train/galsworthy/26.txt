<s> anthony nods it's so wretched her heart's weak since the strike began she has n't even been getting proper food <\s>
<s> i know it for a fact father <\s>
<s> give her what she wants poor woman <\s>
<s> roberts won't let her take anything from us <\s>
<s> staring before him i can't be answerable for the men's obstinacy <\s>
<s> do stop it for my sake <\s>
<s> with a keen look at her you don't understand my dear <\s>
<s> if i were on the board i'd do something <\s>
<s> what would you do <\s>
<s> it's because you can't bear to give way <\s>
<s> what do you know about necessity <\s>
<s> read your novels play your music talk your talk but don't try and tell me what's at the bottom of a struggle like this <\s>
<s> i live down here and see it <\s>
<s> what d you imagine stands between you and your class and these men that you're so sorry for <\s>
<s> coldly i don't know what you mean father <\s>
<s> in a few years you and your children would be down in the condition they're in but for those who have the eyes to see things as they are and the backbone to stand up for themselves <\s>
<s> you don't know the state the men are in <\s>
<s> i know it well enough <\s>
<s> you don't father if you did you would n't anthony <\s>
<s> it's you who don't know the simple facts of the position <\s>
<s> what sort of mercy do you suppose you'd get if no one stood between you and the continual demands of labour <\s>
<s> this sort of mercy he puts his hand up to his throat and squeezes it first would go your sentiments my dear then your culture and your comforts would be going all the time <\s>
<s> i don't believe in barriers between classes <\s>
<s> coldly and i don't know what that has to do with this question <\s>
<s> it will take a generation or two for you to understand <\s>
<s> it's only you and roberts father and you know it <\s>
<s> anthony thrusts out his lower lip it'll ruin the company <\s>
<s> allow me to judge of that <\s>
<s> resentfully i won't stand by and let poor annie roberts suffer like this <\s>
<s> and think of the children father <\s>
<s> with a grim smile what do you propose to do <\s>
<s> anthony only looks at her enid <\s>
<s> in a changed voice stroking his sleeve father you know you oughtn't to have this strain on you you know what dr <\s>
<s> no old man can afford to listen to old women <\s>
<s> but you have done enough even if it really is such a matter of principle with you <\s>
<s> her face works you you might think of us <\s>
<s> it'll break you down <\s>
<s> slowly my dear i am not going to funk on that you may rely <\s>
<s> re enter tench with papers he glances at them then plucking up courage tench <\s>
<s> beg pardon madam i think i'd rather see these papers were disposed of before i get my lunch <\s>
<s> enid after an impatient glance at him looks at her father turns suddenly and goes into the drawing room tench <\s>
<s> holding the papers and a pen to anthony very nervously would you sign these for me please sir <\s>
<s> anthony takes the pen and signs tench <\s>
<s> standing with a sheet of blotting paper behind edgar's chair begins speaking nervously i owe my position to you sir <\s>
<s> i'm obliged to see everything that's going on sir i i depend upon the company entirely <\s>
<s> if anything were to happen to it it'd be disastrous for me <\s>
<s> anthony nods and of course my wife's just had another and so it makes me doubly anxious just now <\s>
<s> and the rates are really terrible down our way <\s>
<s> with grim amusement not more terrible than they are up mine <\s>
<s> very nervously i know the company means a great deal to you sir <\s>
<s> it does i founded it <\s>
<s> if the strike goes on it'll be very serious <\s>
<s> i think the directors are beginning to realise that sir <\s>
