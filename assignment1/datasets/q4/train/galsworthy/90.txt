<s> the figure of strangway is seen in his dark clothes passing from the vestry to the church porch <\s>
<s> he stands plainly visible in the lighted porch locking the door then steps forward <\s>
<s> just as he reaches the edge of the porch a low hiss breaks the silence <\s>
<s> it swells very gradually into a long hissing groan <\s>
<s> strangway stands motionless his hand over his eyes staring into the darkness <\s>
<s> a girl's figure can be seen to break out of the darkness and rush away <\s>
<s> when at last the groaning has died into sheer expectancy strangway drops his hand strangway <\s>
<s> in a loco voice yes <\s>
<s> he's ere no thanks to yu <\s>
<s> the hiss breaks out again then dies away jarland's voice <\s>
<s> threatening try if yu can du it again <\s>
<s> i ask you to forgive me <\s>
<s> a hesitating silence broken by muttering clyst's voice <\s>
<s> e's afraid o the sack that's what tis <\s>
<s> groaning e's a praaper coward <\s>
<s> whu funked the doctor <\s>
<s> shame on ee therr <\s>
<s> you're right all of you <\s>

<s> but don't be troubled <\s>
<s> i'm going you'll get some one better <\s>
<s> i can't see your face it's very dark <\s>
<s> mocking wait for the full mune <\s>
<s> very low my eart e lighted not <\s>
<s> starting at the sound of his own words thus mysteriously given him out of the darkness whoever found that please tear it up <\s>
<s> after a moment's silence many of you have been very kind to me <\s>
<s> you won't see me again good bye all <\s>
<s> he stands for a second motionless then moves resolutely down into the darkness so peopled with shadows uncertain voices as he passes <\s>
<s> he has gone clyst's voice <\s>
<s> three cheers for mr <\s>
<s> and a queer strangled cheer with groans still threading it arises curtain <\s>
<s> act iii scene i in the burlacombes hall sitting room the curtains are drawn a lamp burns and the door stands open <\s>

<s> burlacombe with a startled look back wavers and makes to follow her but stops undecided in the inner doorway <\s>
<s> strangway comes in from the darkness <\s>
<s> he turns to the window and drops overcoat and hat and the church key on the windowseat looking about him as men do when too hard driven and never fixing his eyes long enough on anything to see it <\s>
<s> burlacombe closing the door into the house advances a step <\s>
<s> at the sound strangway faces round burlacombe <\s>
<s> i wanted for yu to know zurr that me an mine adn't nothin to du wi that darned fulishness just now <\s>
