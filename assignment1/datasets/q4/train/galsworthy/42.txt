<s> the shutters of the houses are suddenly thrown wide <\s>
<s> in a lighted room on one aide of the inn are seen two pale men and a woman amongst many clicking machines <\s>
<s> on the other side of the inn in a forge are visible two women and a man but half clothed making chains <\s>
<s> recoiling from both sights in turn how sad they look all <\s>
<s> what are they making <\s>
<s> in the dark doorway of the inn a light shines out and in it is seen a figure visible only from the waist up clad in gold cloth studded with jewels with a flushed complacent face holding in one hand a glass of golden wine <\s>
<s> what is it standing on <\s>
<s> unseen the wine horn's mandolin twangs out <\s>
<s> for that do not look little soul <\s>
<s> can it not walk <\s>
<s> he shakes his head is that all they make here with their sadness <\s>
<s> but again the mandolin twangs out the shutters fall over the houses the door of the inn grows dark <\s>
<s> he has all things <\s>
<s> mine are the clouds with the dark silvered wings mine are the rocks on fire with the sun and the dewdrops cooler than pearls <\s>
<s> away from my breath of snow and sweet grass thou wilt droop little soul <\s>
<s> the dark clove is my fragrance <\s>
<s> the flowers ring eagerly and turning up their faces cry we too smell sweet <\s>
<s> but the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in books cry out i am italy <\s>
<s> see me steam in the distance <\s>
<s> i will never desert thee <\s>
<s> a hundred times i will desert you a hundred times come back and kiss you <\s>
<s> whispering peace for my heart <\s>
<s> with me thou shalt lie on the warm wild thyme <\s>
<s> the flowers laugh happily <\s>
<s> with me you shall lie on a bed of dove's feathers <\s>
<s> i will give you old wine <\s>
<s> i will give thee new milk <\s>
<s> from far away comes the sound as of mandolins <\s>
<s> clasping her breast my heart it is leaving me <\s>
<s> from the distance floats the piping of a shepherd's reed <\s>
<s> curving her hand at her ears the piping <\s>
<s> stay with me seelchen <\s>
<s> come with me seelchen <\s>
<s> i give thee certainty <\s>
<s> i give you chance <\s>
<s> i give thee peace <\s>
<s> i give you change <\s>
<s> i give thee stillness <\s>
<s> i give you voice <\s>
<s> i give thee one love <\s>
<s> i give you many <\s>
<s> as if the words were torn from her heart both both i will love <\s>
<s> and suddenly the peak of the great horn speaks <\s>
<s> and both thou shalt love little soul <\s>
<s> thou shalt lie on the hills with silence and dance in the cities with knowledge <\s>
<s> both shall possess thee <\s>
<s> the sun and the moon on the mountains shall burn thee the lamps of the town singe thy wings <\s>
<s> each shall seem all the world to thee each shall seem as thy grave <\s>
<s> thy heart is a feather blown from one mouth to the other <\s>
<s> but be not afraid <\s>
<s> for the life of a man is for all loves in turn <\s>
<s> tis a little raft moored then sailing out into the blue a tune caught in a hush then whispering on a new born babe half courage and half sleep <\s>
<s> there is a hidden rhythm <\s>
<s> burn on thou pretty flame trying to eat the world <\s>
<s> thou shaft come to me at last my little soul <\s>
<s> the voices and the flower bells peal out <\s>
<s> seelchen enraptured stretches her arms to embrace the sight and sound but all fades slowly into dark sleep <\s>
<s> scene iii the dark scene again becomes glamorous <\s>
<s> seelchen is seen with her hand stretched out towards the piazza of a little town with a plane tree on one side a wall on the other and from the open doorway of an inn a pale path of light <\s>
<s> over the inn hangs a full golden moon <\s>
<s> against the wall under the glimmer of a lamp leans a youth with the face of the wine horn in a crimson dock thrumming a mandolin and singing little star soul through the frost fields of night roaming alone disconsolate from out the cold i call thee in striking my dark mandolin beneath this moon of gold <\s>
<s> from the inn comes a burst of laughter and the sound of dancing <\s>
<s> seelchen whispering it is the big world <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn sings on pretty grey moth where the strange candles shine seeking for warmth so desperate ah <\s>
<s> fluttering dove i bid thee win striking my dark mandolin the crimson flame of love <\s>
<s> gazing enraptured at the inn they are dancing <\s>
<s> as she speaks from either side come moth children meeting and fluttering up the path of light to the inn doorway then wheeling aside they form again and again flutter forward <\s>
<s> holding out her hands they are real <\s>
<s> their wings are windy <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn sings on lips of my song to the white maiden's heart go ye and whisper passionate <\s>
<s> these words that burn o listening one <\s>
<s> love that flieth past is gone nor ever may return seelchen runs towards him but the light above him fades he has become shadow <\s>
<s> she turns bewildered to the dancing moth children but they vanish before her <\s>
<s> at the door of the inn stands lamond in a dark cloak <\s>
<s> without my little soul i am cold <\s>
<s> he holds out his arms to her seelchen <\s>
<s> shall i be safe <\s>
<s> are you safe in your mountains <\s>
<s> where am i here <\s>
<s> smiling he points to the doorway <\s>
<s> and silent as shadows there come dancing out two by two two girls and two youths <\s>
<s> the first girl is dressed in white satin and jewels and the first youth in black velvet <\s>
<s> the second girl is in rags and a shawl and the second youth in shirt and corduroys <\s>
<s> they dance gravely each couple as if in a world apart <\s>
<s> whispering in the mountains all dance together <\s>
<s> do they never change partners <\s>
<s> how could they little one <\s>
<s> those are rich these poor <\s>
<s> a corybantic couple come dancing forth <\s>
<s> the girl has bare limbs <\s>
<s> a flame coloured shift and hair bound with red flowers the youth wears a panther skin <\s>
<s> they pursue not only each other <\s>
<s> but the other girls and youths <\s>
<s> for a moment all is a furious medley <\s>
<s> then the corybantic couple vanish into the inn and the first two couples are left slowly solemnly dancing apart from each other as before <\s>
<s> shuddering shall i one day dance like that <\s>
<s> the youth of the wine horn appears again beneath the lamp <\s>
<s> he strikes a loud chord then as seelchen moves towards that sound the lamp goes out there is again only blue shadow but the couples have disappeared into the inn and the doorway has grown dark <\s>
<s> what i do not like he will not let me see <\s>
<s> will you not come then little soul <\s>
<s> the shutters of the houses are suddenly thrown wide <\s>
<s> in a lighted room on one aide of the inn are seen two pale men and a woman amongst many clicking machines <\s>
