<s> and i met sir thomas hoxton at church this morning and spoke to him about timson <\s>
<s> they look at timson <\s>
<s> then ann goes back to the door and wellwyn follows her ann <\s>
<s> turning i'm going round now daddy to ask professor calway what we're to do with that ferrand <\s>
<s> i wonder if they'll like it <\s>
<s> they'll have to lump it <\s>
<s> she goes out into the house wellwyn <\s>
<s> back at his easel you can shut your mouth now <\s>
<s> megan shuts her mouth but opens it immediately to smile wellwyn <\s>
<s> now that's what i want <\s>
<s> he dabs furiously at the canvas <\s>
<s> then standing back runs his hands through his hair and turns a painter's glance towards the skylight dash <\s>
<s> off you get child don't tempt me <\s>
<s> passing towards the door of the model's room she stops and stealthily looks at the picture timson <\s>
<s> wheeling round want to have a look <\s>
<s> he takes her by the arm and they stand before the canvas <\s>
<s> after a stolid moment she giggles wellwyn <\s>
<s> who has lost her hoarseness it's not like my picture that i had on the pier <\s>
<s> timidly if i had an at on i'd look better <\s>
<s> i don't like hats and i don't like feathers <\s>
<s> megan timidly tugs his sleeve <\s>
<s> timson screened as he thinks by the picture has drawn from his bulky pocket a bottle and is taking a stealthy swig wellwyn <\s>
<s> megan affecting not to notice how much do i owe you <\s>
<s> a little surprised you paid me for to day all cept a penny <\s>
<s> he gives her a coin go and get your feet on <\s>
<s> you've give me arf a crown <\s>
<s> megan smiling at the coin goes towards the model's room <\s>
<s> she looks back at wellwyn as if to draw his eyes to her but he is gazing at the picture then catching old timson's sour glance she grimaces at him kicking up her feet with a little squeal <\s>
<s> but when wellwyn turns to the sound she is demurely passing through the doorway timson <\s>
<s> in his voice of dubious sobriety i've finished these yer brushes sir <\s>
<s> it's not a man's work <\s>
<s> i've been thinkin if you'd keep an orse i could give yer satisfaction <\s>
<s> would the horse timson <\s>
<s> looking him up and down i knows of one that would just suit yer <\s>
<s> reel orse you'd like im <\s>
<s> shaking his head afraid not timson <\s>
<s> awfully sorry though to have nothing better for you than this at present <\s>
<s> faintly waving the brushes of course if you can't afford it i don't press you it's only that i feel i'm not doing meself justice <\s>
<s> confidentially there's just one thing sir i can't bear to see a gen'leman imposed on <\s>
<s> that foreigner 'e's not the sort to ave about the place <\s>
<s> but e'll never do any good with imself <\s>
<s> terrible misfortune to a fellow timson <\s>
<s> don't you believe it sir it's his fault i says to the young lady yesterday miss ann your father's a gen'leman with a sudden accent of hoarse sincerity and so you are i don't mind sayin it but i said he's too easy goin <\s>
<s> well see that girl now <\s>
<s> he shakes his head i never did believe in goin behind a person's back i'm an englishman but lowering his voice she's a bad hat sir <\s>
<s> why look at the street she comes from <\s>
