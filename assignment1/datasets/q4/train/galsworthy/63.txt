<s> megan attracted by the cessation of voices has opened the door and is creeping from the model's room towards the fire <\s>
<s> she has almost reached it before she takes in the torpid crimson figure of old timson <\s>

<s> having quite digested the fact that the old man is in a sort of stupor mrs <\s>
<s> megan goes close to the fire and sits on the little stool smiling sideways at old timson <\s>
<s> ferrand coming quietly up behind examines her from above drooping his long nose as if enquiring with it as to her condition in life then he steps back a yard or two ferrand <\s>
<s> springing to her feet oh <\s>
