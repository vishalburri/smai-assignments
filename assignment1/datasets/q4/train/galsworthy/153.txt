<s> we must have this cleared up <\s>
<s> colford comes in followed by borring and dancy <\s>
<s> captain dancy a serious accusation has been made against you by this gentleman in the presence of several members of the club <\s>
<s> that you robbed him of that money at winsor's <\s>
<s> hard and tense indeed <\s>
<s> on what grounds is he good enough to say that <\s>
<s> tense too you gave me that filly to save yourself her keep and you've been mad about it ever since you knew from goole that i had sold her to kentman and been paid in cash yet i heard you myself deny that you knew it <\s>
<s> you had the next room to me and you can jump like a cat as we saw that evening i found some creepers crushed by a weight on my balcony on that side <\s>
<s> when i went to the bath your door was open and when i came back it was shut <\s>
<s> that's the first we have heard about the door <\s>
<s> i remembered it afterwards <\s>
<s> with intense deliberation i'll settle this matter with any weapons when and where he likes <\s>
<s> drily it can't be settled that way you know very well <\s>
<s> you must take it to the courts unless he retracts <\s>
<s> why did you tell general canynge you didn't know kentman had paid me in cash <\s>
<s> then kentman and goole lied for no reason <\s>
<s> that's nothing to do with me <\s>
<s> if you were downstairs all the time as you say why was your door first open and then shut <\s>
<s> being downstairs how should i know <\s>
<s> i should like to hear what your wife says about it <\s>
<s> leave my wife alone you damned jew <\s>
<s> white with rage thief <\s>
<s> you're very smart dead men tell no tales <\s>
<s> bring your action and we shall see <\s>
<s> dancy takes a step towards him but canynge and winsor interpose <\s>
<s> that'll do mr de levis we won't keep you <\s>
<s> he looks round kindly consider your membership suspended till this matter has been threshed out <\s>
<s> tremulous with anger don't trouble yourselves about my membership <\s>
<s> to dancy you called me a damned jew <\s>
<s> my race was old when you were all savages <\s>
<s> i am proud to be a jew <\s>
<s> au revoir in the courts <\s>
<s> he goes out and silence follows his departure <\s>
<s> if the brute won't fight what am i to do sir <\s>
<s> we've told you take action to clear your name <\s>
<s> colford you saw me in the hall writing letters after our game <\s>
<s> certainly i did you were there when i went to the smoking room <\s>
<s> how long after you left the billiard room <\s>
<s> it's impossible for me to prove that i was there all the time <\s>
<s> it's for de levis to prove what he asserts <\s>
<s> you heard what he said about goole <\s>
