<s> feeling that he does not rub his cheek against hers olive stands away and looks from him to her mother in wonder <\s>
<s> the curtain falls act iii scene i a cobble stoned alley without pavement behind a suburban theatre <\s>
<s> the tall blind dingy yellowish wall of the building is plastered with the tattered remnants of old entertainment bills and the words to let and with several torn and one still virgin placard containing this announcement stop the war meeting october 1st <\s>
<s> addresses by stephen more esq and others <\s>
<s> the alley is plentifully strewn with refuse and scraps of paper <\s>
<s> three stone steps inset lead to the stage door <\s>
<s> it is a dark night and a street lamp close to the wall throws all the light there is <\s>
<s> a faint confused murmur as of distant hooting is heard <\s>
<s> suddenly a boy comes running then two rough girls hurry past in the direction of the sound and the alley is again deserted <\s>
<s> the stage door opens and a doorkeeper poking his head out looks up and down <\s>
<s> he withdraws but in a second reappears preceding three black coated gentlemen <\s>
<s> you can get away down here gentlemen <\s>
<s> keep to the left then sharp to the right round the corner <\s>
<s> dusting themselves and settling their ties thanks very much <\s>
<s> they are joined by a fourth black coated gentleman <\s>
<s> to the doorkeeper thanks <\s>
<s> another boy runs past <\s>
<s> then the door opens again <\s>
<s> steel and more come out <\s>
<s> more stands hesitating on the steps then turns as if to go back <\s>
<s> come along sir come <\s>
<s> it sticks in my gizzard steel <\s>
<s> running his arm through more's and almost dragging him down the steps you owe it to the theatre people <\s>
<s> more still hesitates we might be penned in there another hour you told mrs <\s>
<s> more half past ten it'll only make her anxious <\s>
<s> and she hasn't seen you for six weeks <\s>
<s> all right don't dislocate my arm <\s>
<s> they move down the steps and away to the left as a boy comes running down the alley <\s>
<s> sighting more he stops dead spins round and crying shrilly ere e is <\s>
<s> he bolts back in the direction whence he came <\s>
<s> that is the end of the limit as the foreign ambassador remarked <\s>
<s> pulling him back towards the door well <\s>
<s> come inside again anyway <\s>
<s> a number of men and boys and a few young girls are trooping quickly from the left <\s>
<s> a motley crew out for excitement loafers artisans navvies girls rough or dubious <\s>
<s> all in the mood of hunters and having tasted blood <\s>
<s> they gather round the steps displaying the momentary irresolution and curiosity that follows on a new development of any chase <\s>
<s> more on the bottom step turns and eyes them <\s>
<s> at the edge which is im <\s>
<s> the old un or the young <\s>
<s> more turns and mounts the remaining steps tall youth <\s>
<s> with lank black hair under a bowler hat you blasted traitor <\s>
<s> more faces round at the volley of jeering that follows the chorus of booing swells then gradually dies as if they realized that they were spoiling their own sport <\s>
<s> don't frighten the poor feller <\s>
<s> a girl beside her utters a shrill laugh steel <\s>
<s> tugging at more's arm come along sir <\s>
<s> shaking his arm free to the crowd well what do you want <\s>
<s> at the back of the crowd look at his white liver <\s>
<s> you can see it in his face <\s>
<s> in front shut it <\s>
<s> give im a chanst <\s>
<s> silence for the blasted traitor <\s>
<s> a youth plays the concertina there is laughter then an abrupt silence <\s>
<s> you shall have it in a nutshell <\s>
<s> flinging a walnut shell which strikes more on the shoulder here y'are <\s>
<s> go home and think <\s>
<s> if foreigners invaded us wouldn't you be fighting tooth and nail like those tribesmen out there <\s>
<s> why don't they come out in the open <\s>
<s> they fight the best way they can <\s>
<s> a burst of hooting is led by a soldier in khaki on the outskirt more <\s>
<s> my friend there in khaki led that hooting <\s>
<s> i've never said a word against our soldiers <\s>
<s> it's the government i condemn for putting them to this and the press for hounding on the government and all of you for being led by the nose to do what none of you would do left to yourselves <\s>
<s> the tall youth leads a somewhat unspontaneous burst of execration <\s>
<s> i say not one of you would go for a weaker man <\s>
<s> voices in the crowd <\s>
<s> he's gittin at you <\s>
<s> suddenly shouldering forward look ere mister <\s>
<s> don't you come gaflin to those who've got mates out there or it'll be the worse for you you go ome <\s>
<s> and git your wife to put cottonwool in yer ears <\s>
<s> a spurt of laughter a friendly voice <\s>
<s> from the outskirts shame <\s>
<s> a scuffle drowns this cry more <\s>
<s> with vehemence stop that <\s>
<s> ought to be shot backin his country's enemies <\s>
<s> those tribesmen are defending their homes <\s>
<s> they are hustled into silence tall youth <\s>
<s> with sudden passion defending their homes <\s>
<s> not mobbing unarmed men <\s>
<s> steel again pulls at his arm rough <\s>
<s> shut it or we'll do you in <\s>
<s> recovering his coolness ah <\s>
<s> do me in by all means <\s>
<s> you'd deal such a blow at cowardly mobs as wouldn't be forgotten in your time <\s>
<s> for god's sake sir <\s>
<s> shaking off his touch well <\s>
<s> there is an ugly rush checked by the fall of the foremost figures thrown too suddenly against the bottom step <\s>
<s> there is a momentary lull and more stares steadily down at them <\s>
<s> don't e speak well <\s>
<s> two or three nutshells and a piece of orange peel strike more across the face <\s>
<s> he takes no notice <\s>
<s> give im some encouragement <\s>
<s> the jeering laughter is changed to anger by the contemptuous smile on more's face <\s>
<s> don't stand there like a stuck pig <\s>
<s> let's ave im dahn off that <\s>
<s> under cover of the applause that greets this he strikes more across the legs with a belt <\s>
<s> more flinging out his arm turns him back and resumes his tranquil staring at the crowd in whom the sense of being foiled by this silence is fast turning to rage <\s>
<s> speak up or get down <\s>
