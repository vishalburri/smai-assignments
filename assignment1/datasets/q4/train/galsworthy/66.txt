<s> there sound a number of little tat tat knocks wellwyn <\s>
<s> isn't that the professor's knock <\s>
<s> while ann sits down to make tea he goes to the door and opens it <\s>
<s> there dressed in an ulster stands a thin clean shaved man with a little hollow sucked into either cheek who taking off a grey squash hat discloses a majestically bald forehead which completely dominates all that comes below it wellwyn <\s>
<s> so awfully good of you <\s>
<s> you know canon bentley i think <\s>
<s> your opinion will be invaluable professor <\s>
<s> they have assembled round the tea table calway <\s>
<s> thank you no tea milk <\s>
<s> he pours rum into calway's milk calway <\s>
<s> turning to ann you were going to show me some one you're trying to rescue or something i think <\s>
<s> he'll be here directly simply perfect rotter <\s>
<s> i think you said he was a congenital <\s>
<s> with great interest what <\s>
<s> to calway yes i i think that's what you call him <\s>
<s> no and quite healthy a vagabond <\s>
<s> is it do you think chronic unemployment with a vagrant tendency <\s>
<s> or would it be nearer the mark to say vagrancy wellwyn <\s>
<s> with a smile of knowledge quite <\s>
<s> breaking in before he comes there's another bertley <\s>
<s> blandly yes when you came in we were discussing what should be done with a man who drinks rum calway pauses in the act of drinking that doesn't belong to him <\s>
<s> well perhaps you could tell us drink certainly changing thine to mine <\s>
<s> the professor could see him wellwyn <\s>
<s> rising yes do come and look at him professor calway <\s>
<s> she points towards the model's room <\s>
<s> calway smiles deprecatingly ann <\s>
<s> no really we needn't open the door <\s>
<s> you can see him through the glass <\s>
<s> he's more than half calway <\s>
<s> well i hardly ann <\s>
<s> come on professor calway <\s>
<s> we must know what to do with him <\s>
<s> calway rises you can stand on a chair <\s>
<s> she draws calway to the model's room which is lighted by a glass panel in the top of the high door <\s>
<s> canon bertley also rises and stands watching <\s>
