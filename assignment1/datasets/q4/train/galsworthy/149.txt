<s> charles winsor a tall fair good looking man about thirty eight is taking off a smoking jacket <\s>
<s> from her bedroom hallo <\s>
<s> she appears in the doorway in under garment and a wrapper <\s>
<s> she too is fair about thirty five rather delicious and suggestive of porcelain <\s>
<s> lord st erth and ferdy de levis <\s>
<s> that young man has too much luck the young bounder won two races to day and he's as rich as croesus <\s>
<s> charlie he did look so exactly as if he'd sold me a carpet when i was paying him <\s>
<s> changing into slippers his father did sell carpets wholesale in the city <\s>
<s> and you say i haven't intuition <\s>
<s> with a finger on her lips morison's in there <\s>
<s> motioning towards the door which she shuts ronny dancy took a tenner off him anyway before dinner <\s>
<s> standing jump on to a bookcase four feet high <\s>
<s> de levis had to pay up and sneered at him for making money by parlour tricks <\s>
<s> that young jew gets himself disliked <\s>
<s> aren't you rather prejudiced <\s>
<s> that's not against him rather the contrary these days <\s>
<s> but he pushes himself <\s>
<s> the general tells me he's deathly keen to get into the jockey club <\s>
<s> taking off his tie it's amusing to see him trying to get round old st erth <\s>
<s> if lord st erth and general canynge backed him he'd get in if he did sell carpets <\s>
<s> he's got some pretty good horses <\s>
<s> taking off his waistcoat ronny dancy's on his bones again i'm afraid <\s>
<s> he had a bad day <\s>
<s> when a chap takes to doing parlour stunts for a bet it's a sure sign <\s>
<s> what made him chuck the army <\s>
<s> he says it's too dull now there's no fighting <\s>
<s> well he can't exist on backing losers <\s>
<s> isn't it just like him to get married now <\s>
<s> he really is the most reckless person <\s>
<s> he's a queer chap <\s>
<s> i've always liked him but i've never quite made him out <\s>
<s> what do you think of his wife <\s>
<s> nice child awfully gone on him <\s>
<s> quite indecently both of them <\s>
<s> nodding towards the wall left they're next door <\s>
<s> de levis and margaret orme at the end <\s>
<s> charlie do you realise that the bathroom out there has to wash those four <\s>
<s> your grandfather was crazy when he built this wing six rooms in a row with balconies like an hotel and only one bath if we hadn't put ours in <\s>
<s> looking at his watch half past eleven <\s>
<s> yawns newmarket always makes me sleepy <\s>
<s> you're keeping morison up <\s>
<s> lady adela goes to the door blowing a kiss <\s>
<s> charles goes up to his dressing table and begins to brush his hair sprinkling on essence <\s>
<s> there is a knock on the corridor door <\s>
<s> de levis enters clad in pyjamas and flowered dressing gown <\s>
<s> he is a dark good looking rather eastern young man <\s>
<s> his face is long and disturbed <\s>
<s> anything i can do for you <\s>
<s> in a voice whose faint exoticism is broken by a vexed excitement i say i'm awfully sorry winsor but i thought i'd better tell you at once <\s>
<s> i've just had er rather a lot of money stolen <\s>
<s> there is something of outrage in his tone and glance as who should say in my house how do you mean stolen <\s>
<s> i put it under my pillow and went to have a bath when i came back it was gone <\s>
<s> nearly a thousand nine hundred and seventy i think <\s>
<s> again the faint tone of outrage that a man should have so much money about him <\s>
<s> i sold my rosemary filly to day on the course to bentman the bookie and he paid me in notes <\s>
<s> that weed dancy gave you in the spring <\s>
<s> but i tried her pretty high the other day and she's in the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> i was only out of my room a quarter of an hour and i locked my door <\s>
<s> again outraged you locked de levis <\s>
<s> not seeing the fine shade yes and had the key here <\s>
<s> he taps his pocket look here <\s>
<s> he holds out a pocket book it's been stuffed with my shaving papers <\s>
