<s> she moves towards the rock goatherd <\s>
<s> but the flowers encircle him and when they wheel away he has vanished <\s>
<s> she turns to the flowers but they too vanish <\s>
<s> the veils of mist are rising <\s>
<s> she rubs her eyes then turning once more to the rock sees felsman standing there with his arms folded thou <\s>
<s> so thou hast come like a sick heifer to be healed <\s>
<s> was it good in the town that kept thee so long <\s>
<s> i do not regret <\s>
<s> never again shalt thou go from me <\s>
<s> mocking with what wilt thou keep me <\s>
<s> i have known change i am no timid maid <\s>
<s> moodily aye thou art different <\s>
<s> thine eyes are hollow thou art white faced <\s>
<s> still mocking then what hast thou here that shall keep me <\s>
<s> there is a faint wailing of wind <\s>
<s> the noise of the wind dies away <\s>
<s> yes it is lonely <\s>
<s> and the flowers shall dance to thee <\s>
<s> and to a ringing of their bells <\s>
<s> the flowers come dancing till one by one they cease and sink down nodding falling asleep <\s>
<s> even they grow sleepy here <\s>
