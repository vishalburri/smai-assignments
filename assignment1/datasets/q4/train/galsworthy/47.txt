<s> i am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner committed this act my lord <\s>
<s> i quite appreciate that <\s>
<s> but this was long after the act <\s>
<s> yes my lord but it contributes to my contention <\s>
<s> you say a woman <\s>
<s> do you mean that she came to the office <\s>
<s> asked to see young falder he was out at the moment <\s>
<s> did you see her <\s>
<s> did she come alone <\s>
<s> confidentially well there you put me in a difficulty <\s>
<s> i mustn't tell you what the office boy told me <\s>
<s> cokeson quite so cokeson <\s>
<s> breaking in with an air of you are young leave it to me but i think we can get round it <\s>
<s> in answer to a question put to her by a third party the woman said to me they're mine sir <\s>
<s> how do you know <\s>
<s> your lordship mustn't ask me that or i shall have to tell you what i was told and that'd never do <\s>
<s> smiling the office boy made a statement <\s>
<s> what i want to ask you mr <\s>
<s> in the course of her appeal to see falder did the woman say anything that you specially remember <\s>
<s> looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the sentence a leetle more sir <\s>
<s> or did she not <\s>
<s> i shouldn't like you to have led me to the answer <\s>
<s> with an irritated smile will you tell the jury what it was <\s>
<s> it's a matter of life and death <\s>
<s> foreman of the jury <\s>
<s> do you mean the woman said that <\s>
<s> nodding it's not the sort of thing you like to have said to you <\s>
<s> a little impatiently did falder come in while she was there <\s>
<s> cokeson nods and she saw him and went away <\s>
<s> there i can't follow you <\s>
<s> i didn't see her go <\s>
<s> well is she there now <\s>
<s> with an indulgent smile no <\s>
<s> he sits down cleaver <\s>
<s> rising you say that on the morning of the forgery the prisoner was jumpy <\s>
<s> well now sir what precisely do you mean by that word <\s>
<s> indulgently i want you to understand <\s>
<s> have you ever seen a dog that's lost its master <\s>
<s> he was kind of everywhere at once with his eyes <\s>
<s> thank you i was coming to his eyes <\s>
<s> you called them funny <\s>
<s> what are we to understand by that <\s>
<s> sharply yes sir but what may be funny to you may not be funny to me or to the jury <\s>
<s> did they look frightened or shy or fierce or what <\s>
<s> you make it very hard for me <\s>
<s> i give you the word and you want me to give you another <\s>
<s> rapping his desk does funny mean mad <\s>
<s> not mad fun cleaver <\s>
<s> now you say he had his collar unbuttoned <\s>
<s> was it a hot day <\s>
<s> ye es i think it was <\s>
<s> and did he button it when you called his attention to it <\s>
<s> ye es i think he did <\s>
<s> would you say that that denoted insanity <\s>
<s> cokeson who has opened his mouth to reply is left gaping <\s>
<s> rising hastily have you ever caught him in that dishevelled state before <\s>
<s> he was always clean and quiet <\s>
<s> that will do thank you <\s>
<s> cokeson turns blandly to the judge as though to rebuke counsel for not remembering that the judge might wish to have a chance arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing further he turns and descends from the box and sits down next to james and walter <\s>
<s> ruth comes into court and takes her stand stoically in the witness box <\s>
<s> what is your name please <\s>
<s> how old are you <\s>
<s> you are a married woman living with your husband <\s>
<s> no sir not since july <\s>
<s> have you any children <\s>
<s> are they living with you <\s>
<s> you know the prisoner <\s>
<s> looking at him yes <\s>
<s> what was the nature of your relations with him <\s>
<s> sharply in what sense do you use that word <\s>
<s> we love each other <\s>
<s> shaking her head no your lordship not yet <\s>
<s> he looks from ruth to falder well <\s>
<s> what is your husband <\s>
<s> and what was the nature of your married life <\s>
<s> shaking her head it don't bear talking about <\s>
<s> did he ill treat you or what <\s>
<s> ever since my first was born <\s>
<s> i'd rather not say <\s>
<s> all sorts of ways <\s>
<s> i am afraid i must stop this you know <\s>
<s> pointing to falder he offered to take me out of it sir <\s>
<s> we were going to south america <\s>
<s> hastily yes quite and what prevented you <\s>
<s> i was outside his office when he was taken away <\s>
<s> it nearly broke my heart <\s>
<s> you knew then that he had been arrested <\s>
<s> i called at his office afterwards and pointing to cokeson that gentleman told me all about it <\s>
<s> now do you remember the morning of friday july 7th <\s>
<s> my husband nearly strangled me that morning <\s>
<s> bowing her head yes my lord <\s>
<s> with his hands or <\s>
