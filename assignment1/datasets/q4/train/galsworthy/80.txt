<s> the noise ebbs and more looks round him chief student <\s>
<s> now then you sir <\s>
<s> in a quiet voice very well <\s>
<s> you are here by the law that governs the action of all mobs the law of force <\s>
<s> by that law you can do what you like to this body of mine <\s>
<s> and we will too <\s>
<s> i don't doubt it <\s>
<s> but before that i've a word to say <\s>
<s> another voice raises a donkey's braying more <\s>
<s> you mob are the most contemptible thing under the sun <\s>
<s> when you walk the street god goes in <\s>
<s> down with the beggar <\s>
<s> above the murmurs my fine friends i'm not afraid of you <\s>
<s> you are very exalted stephen <\s>
<s> i don't like living i won't live with one whose equal i am not <\s>
<s> this has been coming ever since you made that speech <\s>
<s> i told you that night what the end would be <\s>
<s> trying to put his arms round her don't be so terribly cruel <\s>
<s> let's have the truth <\s>
<s> people so wide apart don't love <\s>
<s> in god's name how can i help the difference in our faiths <\s>
<s> last night you used the word bargain <\s>
<s> i meant to buy you <\s>
<s> i meant to kill your faith <\s>

<s> i don't like to be shown up as a driver of bargains stephen <\s>
<s> god knows i never meant katherine <\s>
<s> if i'm not yours in spirit i don't choose to be your mistress <\s>
<s> more as if lashed by a whip has thrown up his hands in an attitude of defence <\s>
<s> it shows the heights you live on <\s>
<s> i won't drag you down <\s>
<s> for god's sake put your pride away and see <\s>
<s> i'm fighting for the faith that's in me <\s>
<s> what else can a man do <\s>
<s> doing nothing sitting silent when my brothers are fighting and being killed <\s>
<s> i shall try to go out nursing <\s>

<s> i have my faith too my poor common love of country <\s>
<s> i can't stay here with you <\s>
<s> i spent last night on the floor thinking and i know <\s>
<s> i shall leave her at father's with nurse unless you forbid me to take her <\s>
<s> icily that i shall not do you know very well <\s>
<s> you are free to go and to take her <\s>
<s> very low thank you <\s>
<s> suddenly she turns to him and draws his eyes on her <\s>
<s> without a sound she puts her whole strength into that look stephen <\s>
