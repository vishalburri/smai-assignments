<s> mr vane ecstatically if only vane <\s>
<s> pleased and happy yes yes <\s>
<s> all right you were splendid <\s>
<s> the voice dies away <\s>
<s> suddenly his head nods he fights his drowsiness writes a word or two nods again and in twenty seconds is asleep the stage is darkened by a black out <\s>
<s> frust's voice is heard speaking frust <\s>
<s> what's that girl's name <\s>
<s> the stage is lighted up again <\s>
<s> moonlight bright on the orchard the room in darkness where the professor's figure is just visible sleeping in the chair and screwed a little more round towards the window <\s>
<s> from behind the mossy boulder a faun like figure uncurls itself and peeps over with ears standing up and elbows leaning on the stone playing a rustic pipe and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and listening <\s>
<s> a shiver of wind passes blowing petals from the apple trees the faun darts his head towards where from right comes slowly the figure of a greek youth holding a lute or lyre which his fingers strike lifting out little wandering strains as of wind whinnying in funnels and odd corners <\s>
<s> the faun darts down behind the stone and the youth stands by the boulder playing his lute <\s>
<s> slowly while he plays the whitened trunk of an apple tree is seen to dissolve into the body of a girl with bare arms and feet her dark hair unbound and the face of the professor's wife <\s>
<s> hypnotized she slowly sways towards him their eyes fixed on each other till she is quite close <\s>
<s> her arms go out to him cling round his neck and their lips meet <\s>
<s> but as they meet there comes a gasp and the professor with rumpled hair is seen starting from his chair his hands thrown up and at his horrified oh <\s>
<s> the stage is darkened with a black out the voice of frust is heard speaking frust <\s>
<s> the stage is lighted up again as in the opening scene <\s>
<s> the professor is seen in his chair with spilt sheets of paper round him waking from a dream <\s>
<s> he shakes himself pinches his leg stares heavily round into the moonlight rises <\s>
<s> he moves to the window and calls blanche <\s>
<s> to himself made trees made trees <\s>
<s> appearing by the stone with her hair down here <\s>
<s> i say i  i've been asleep had a dream <\s>
<s> she comes and they stand in the window prof <\s>
<s> i dreamed i saw a faun on that boulder blowing on a pipe <\s>
<s> he looks nervously at the stone with two damned little rabbits and a fox sitting up and listening <\s>
<s> and then from out there came our friend orpheus playing on his confounded lute till he actually turned that tree there into you <\s>
<s> and gradually he he drew you like a snake till you er put your arms round his neck and er kissed him <\s>
<s> it was no dream <\s>
<s> he was bringing me to life <\s>
<s> do you suppose i am alive <\s>
<s> i'm as dead as euridice <\s>
<s> good heavens blanche what's the matter with you to night <\s>
<s> pointing to the litter of papers why don't we live instead of writing of it <\s>
<s> she points out unto the moonlight what do we get out of life <\s>
<s> money fame fashion talk learning <\s>
<s> and what good are they <\s>
<s> i want to live <\s>
<s> helplessly my dear i really don't know what you mean <\s>
<s> pointing out into the moonlight look <\s>
<s> orpheus with his lute and nobody can see him <\s>
<s> beauty beauty beauty we let it go <\s>
<s> with sudden passion beauty love the spring <\s>
<s> they should be in us and they're all outside <\s>
<s> my dear this is this is awful <\s>
<s> he tries to embrace her wife <\s>
<s> avoiding him an a stilly voice oh <\s>
<s> go on with your writing <\s>
<s> i've never known you so so wife <\s>
<s> i'll go and sing <\s>
<s> i'm sorry darling i really am <\s>
<s> he gives and she accepts a kiss better <\s>
<s> he gravitates towards his papers all right now <\s>
<s> standing still and looking at him quite <\s>
<s> well i'll try and finish this to night then to morrow we might have a jaunt <\s>
<s> how about a theatre <\s>
<s> there's a thing they say called chinese chops that's been running years <\s>
<s> softly to herself as he settles down into his chair oh <\s>
<s> while he takes up a sheet of paper and adjusts himself she stands at the window staring with all her might at the boulder till from behind it the faun's head and shoulders emerge once more prof <\s>
<s> very queer the power suggestion has over the mind <\s>
<s> there's nothing really in animism you know except the curious shapes rocks trees and things take in certain lights effect they have on our imagination <\s>
<s> he looks up what's the matter now <\s>
<s> her eyes waver to him again and the faun vanishes <\s>
<s> she turns again to look at the boulder there is nothing there a little shiver of wind blows some petals off the trees <\s>
<s> she catches one of them and turning quickly goes out through the curtain prof <\s>
<s> coming to himself and writing the orpheus legend is the er apotheosis of animism <\s>
<s> can we accept his voice is lost in the sound of his wife's voice beginning again orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees it dies in a sob <\s>
<s> the professor looks up startled as the curtain falls <\s>
<s> take up the curtain <\s>
<s> the curtain goes up foreson <\s>
<s> he and frust leave their seats and ascend on to the stage on which are collecting the four players vane <\s>
<s> give us some light <\s>
<s> turn up your floats <\s>
<s> the footlights go up and the blue goes out the light is crude as at the beginning frust <\s>
<s> i'd like to meet miss hellgrove <\s>
<s> she comes forward eagerly and timidly <\s>
<s> he grasps her hand miss hellgrove i want to say i thought that fine fine <\s>
<s> her evident emotion and pleasure warm him so that he increases his grasp and commendation fine <\s>
<s> it quite got my soft spots <\s>
<s> mr frust it means so much to me <\s>
<s> a little balder in the eye and losing warmth er fine <\s>
<s> his eye wanders where's mr flatway <\s>
