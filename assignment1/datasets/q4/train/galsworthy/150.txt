<s> lady adela goes out into her room and closes the door <\s>
<s> look here de levis <\s>
<s> this isn't an hotel <\s>
<s> it's the sort of thing that doesn't happen in a decent house <\s>
<s> are you sure you're not mistaken and didn't have them stolen on the course <\s>
<s> i counted them just before putting them under my pillow then i locked the door and had the key here <\s>
<s> there's only one door you know <\s>
<s> how was your window <\s>
<s> drawing back the curtains of his own window you've got a balcony like this <\s>
<s> any sign of a ladder or anything <\s>
<s> it must have been done from the window unless someone had a skeleton key <\s>
<s> who knew you'd got that money <\s>
<s> where did kentman pay you <\s>
<s> just round the corner in the further paddock <\s>
<s> i didn't notice anything <\s>
<s> you must have been marked down and followed here <\s>
<s> how would they know my room <\s>
<s> might have got it somehow <\s>
<s> a knock from the corridor come in <\s>
<s> treisure the butler appears a silent grave man of almost supernatural conformity <\s>
<s> de levis gives him a quick hard look noted and resented by winsor <\s>
<s> to winsor yes sir <\s>
<s> who valets mr de levis <\s>
