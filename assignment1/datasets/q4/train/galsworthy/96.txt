<s> as a man i think it's rotten <\s>
<s> and as a pressman <\s>
<s> like a stilton cheese <\s>
<s> he is about to write press <\s>
<s> my stunt lord william <\s>
<s> he jots it on his cuff lord w <\s>
<s> would you say that a strong press movement would help to quiet the country <\s>
<s> well as you ask me lord william i'll tell you <\s>
<s> no newspapers for a month would do the trick <\s>
<s> yes but i should starve <\s>
<s> he suddenly looks up and his eyes like gimlets bore their way into lord william's pleasant troubled face lord william you could do me a real kindness <\s>
<s> authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here i've got his address <\s>
<s> i promise you to do it most discreetly <\s>
<s> fact is well i'm in low water <\s>
<s> since the war we simply can't get sensation enough for the new taste <\s>
<s> now if i could have an article headed bombed and bomber sort of double interview you know it'd very likely set me on my legs again <\s>
<s> he holds out his frayed wristbands lord w <\s>
<s> grasping his hand my dear chap certainly <\s>
<s> go and interview this blighter and then bring him round here <\s>
<s> you can do that for one <\s>
<s> i'd very much like to see him as a matter of fact <\s>
<s> thanks awfully i shall never forget it <\s>
<s> scribbling lord william thought it d  d natural <\s>
<s> overhearing no no don't put that down <\s>
<s> what i mean is i should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the marseillaise about the streets fellows that have been in the war real sports they are you know thorough good chaps at bottom and say to them have a feeling heart boys put yourself in my position <\s>
<s> i don't believe a bit they'd want to bomb me then <\s>
<s> he walks up and down press <\s>
<s> scribbling and muttering the idea of brotherhood d'you mind my saying that <\s>
<s> word brotherhood always effective always he writes lord e <\s>
<s> well it's pure accident that i'm here and they're there <\s>
<s> all the same i can't pretend to be starving <\s>
<s> can't go out into hyde park and stand on a tub can i <\s>
<s> but if i could only show them what i feel they're such good chaps poor devils <\s>
<s> he writes camel and needle's eye <\s>
<s> you were at eton and oxford <\s>
<s> your constituency i know <\s>
<s> but i can get all that <\s>
<s> is it your view that christianity is on the up grade lord william <\s>
<s> dubious what d'you mean by christianity loving kindness and that <\s>
<s> of course i think that dogma's got the knock <\s>
<s> writing lord william thought dogma had got the knock <\s>
<s> i should like you just to develop your definition of christianity <\s>
<s> loving kindness strikes rather a new note <\s>
<s> what about the sermon on the mount <\s>
<s> writing refers to sermon on mount <\s>
<s> i take it you don't belong to any church lord william <\s>
<s> exasperated well really i've been baptised and that sort of thing <\s>
<s> but look here press <\s>
<s> you can trust me i shan't say anything that you'll regret <\s>
<s> now do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country <\s>
<s> well i think it would be a deuced good thing if everybody were a bit more kind <\s>
<s> musing i feel that your views are strikingly original lord william <\s>
<s> if you could just open out on them a little more <\s>
<s> how far would you apply kindness in practice <\s>
<s> can you apply it in theory <\s>
<s> i believe it is done <\s>
<s> but would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity <\s>
<s> well that's a bit extreme <\s>
<s> but i quite sympathise with this chap <\s>
<s> imagine yourself in his shoes <\s>
<s> he sees a huge house all these bottles us swilling them down perhaps he's got a starving wife or consumptive kids <\s>
<s> writing and murmuring um m <\s>
<s> he thinks but for the grace of god there swill i <\s>
<s> why should that blighter have everything and i nothing <\s>
<s> writing and all that <\s>
<s> and gradually you see this contrast becomes an obsession with him <\s>
<s> there's got to be an example made he thinks and er he makes it don't you know <\s>
<s> and when you're the example <\s>
<s> well you feel a bit blue of course <\s>
<s> but my point is that you quite see it <\s>
<s> from the other world <\s>
<s> do you believe in a future life lord william <\s>
<s> the public took a lot of interest in the question if you remember at the time of the war <\s>
<s> it might revive at any moment if there's to be a revolution <\s>
<s> the wish is always father to the thought isn't it <\s>
<s> but er doesn't the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness <\s>
<s> if there isn't one why be kind <\s>
<s> well i should say one oughtn't to be kind for any motive that's self interest but just because one feels it don't you know <\s>
<s> writing vigorously that's very new very new <\s>
<s> simply you chaps are wonderful <\s>
<s> doubtfully you mean we're we're lord w <\s>
<s> you have such a d  d hard time <\s>
<s> it must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me <\s>
<s> not at all lord william <\s>
<s> i assure you compared with a literary man it's it's almost heavenly <\s>
<s> you must have a wonderful knowledge of things <\s>
<s> bridling a little well i shouldn't say that <\s>
<s> i don't see how you can avoid it <\s>
<s> you turn your hands to everything <\s>
<s> i say is there really going to be a revolution or are you making it up you press <\s>
<s> we never know whether we come before the event or it comes before us <\s>
<s> d'you mind lending me your note book a moment <\s>
<s> i'd like to stick that down <\s>
<s> all right i'll use the other end <\s>
<s> the press hands it hypnotically lord w <\s>
<s> now what's your real opinion of the situation <\s>
<s> as a man or a press man <\s>
<s> is there any difference <\s>
<s> is there any connection <\s>
<s> well as a man <\s>
<s> as a man i think it's rotten <\s>
<s> and as a pressman <\s>
<s> like a stilton cheese <\s>
