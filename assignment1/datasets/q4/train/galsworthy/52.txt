<s> awfully sorry for me <\s>
<s> with quiet bitterness but it doesn't do to associate with criminals <\s>
<s> come come it's no use calling yourself names <\s>
<s> that never did a man any good <\s>
<s> put a face on it <\s>
<s> it's easy enough to put a face on it sir when you're independent <\s>
<s> try it when you're down like me <\s>
<s> they talk about giving you your deserts <\s>
<s> well i think i've had just a bit over <\s>
<s> eyeing him askance over his spectacles i hope they haven't made a socialist of you <\s>
<s> falder is suddenly still as if brooding over his past self he utters a peculiar laugh <\s>
<s> you must give them credit for the best intentions <\s>
<s> nobody wishes you harm i'm sure <\s>
<s> i believe that mr <\s>
<s> nobody wishes you harm but they down you all the same <\s>
<s> this feeling he stares round him as though at something closing in it's crushing me <\s>
<s> with sudden impersonality i know it is <\s>
<s> horribly disturbed there's nothing there <\s>
<s> we must try and take it quiet <\s>
<s> i'm sure i've often had you in my prayers <\s>
<s> now leave it to me <\s>
<s> i'll use my gumption and take em when they're jolly <\s>
<s> as he speaks the two partners come in cokeson rather disconcerted but trying to put them all at ease i didn't expect you quite so soon <\s>
<s> i've just been having a talk with this young man <\s>
<s> i think you'll remember him <\s>
<s> with a grave keen look quite well <\s>
<s> how are you falder <\s>
<s> holding out his hand almost timidly very glad to see you again falder <\s>
<s> who has recovered his self control takes the hand thank you sir <\s>
<s> just a word mr <\s>
<s> to falder pointing to the clerks office you might go in there a minute <\s>
<s> you know your way <\s>
<s> our junior won't be coming this morning <\s>
<s> his wife's just had a little family <\s>
<s> falder goes uncertainly out into the clerks office <\s>
<s> confidentially i'm bound to tell you all about it <\s>
<s> but there's a prejudice against him <\s>
<s> and you're not seeing him to advantage this morning he's under nourished <\s>
<s> it's very trying to go without your dinner <\s>
<s> is that so cokeson <\s>
<s> i wanted to ask you <\s>
<s> he's had his lesson <\s>
<s> now we know all about him and we want a clerk <\s>
<s> there is a young fellow applying but i'm keeping him in the air <\s>
<s> a gaol bird in the office cokeson <\s>
<s> i don't see it <\s>
<s> the rolling of the chariot wheels of justice <\s>
<s> i've never got that out of my head <\s>
<s> i've nothing to reproach myself with in this affair <\s>
<s> what's he been doing since he came out <\s>
<s> he's had one or two places but he hasn't kept them <\s>
<s> seems to fancy everybody's down on him <\s>
<s> don't like the fellow never did from the first <\s>
<s> weak character s written all over him <\s>
<s> i think we owe him a leg up <\s>
<s> he brought it all on himself <\s>
<s> the doctrine of full responsibility doesn't quite hold in these days <\s>
<s> rather grimly you'll find it safer to hold it for all that my boy <\s>
<s> for oneself yes not for other people thanks <\s>
<s> i don't want to be hard <\s>
<s> i'm glad to hear you say that <\s>
<s> he seems to see something spreading his arms round him <\s>
<s> what about that woman he was mixed up with <\s>
<s> i saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in <\s>
<s> well i can't keep anything from you <\s>
<s> he has met her <\s>
