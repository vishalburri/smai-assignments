<s> yes i had to take the money back <\s>
<s> you mean the nine pounds <\s>
<s> your wits were sufficiently keen for you to remember that <\s>

<s> rising did you have your lunch before going back <\s>
<s> i never ate a thing all day and at night i couldn't sleep <\s>

<s> had that any connection with what you were doing <\s>
<s> was that in the office before you ran out <\s>
<s> yes and while i was running <\s>

<s> gathering up notes if it please your lordship gentlemen of the jury my friend in cross examination has shown a disposition to sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case and i am free to admit that nothing i can say will move you if the evidence has not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in a moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not responsible for his actions a moment of such mental and moral vacuity arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he had been suffering as to amount to temporary madness <\s>
<s> my friend has alluded to the romantic glamour with which i have sought to invest this case <\s>
<s> gentlemen i have done nothing of the kind <\s>
<s> i have merely shown you the background of life that palpitating life which believe me whatever my friend may say always lies behind the commission of a crime <\s>
<s> now gentlemen we live in a highly civilized age and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange way even when we have no personal interest in the matter <\s>
<s> but when we see it inflicted on a woman whom we love what then <\s>
<s> just think of what your own feelings would have been each of you at the prisoner's age and then look at him <\s>
<s> he is hardly the comfortable shall we say bucolic person likely to contemplate with equanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was devotedly attached <\s>
<s> yes gentlemen look at him <\s>
<s> he has not a strong face but neither has he a vicious face <\s>
<s> he is just the sort of man who would easily become the prey of his emotions <\s>
<s> you have heard the description of his eyes <\s>
<s> my friend may laugh at the word funny i think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of those who are strained to breaking point than any other word which could have been used <\s>
<s> i don't pretend mind you that his mental irresponsibility was more than a flash of darkness in which all sense of proportion became lost but to contend that just as a man who destroys himself at such a moment may be and often is absolved from the stigma attaching to the crime of self murder so he may and frequently does commit other crimes while in this irresponsible condition and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent and treated as a patient <\s>
<s> i admit that this is a plea which might well be abused <\s>
<s> it is a matter for discretion <\s>
<s> but here you have a case in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt <\s>
<s> you heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four fatal minutes <\s>
<s> what was his answer <\s>
<s> i thought of mr <\s>
<s> gentlemen no man could invent an answer like that it is absolutely stamped with truth <\s>
<s> you have seen the great affection legitimate or not existing between him and this woman who came here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life <\s>
<s> it is impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he committed this act <\s>
<s> we well know what terrible havoc such distress can make in weak and highly nervous people <\s>
<s> it was all the work of a moment <\s>
<s> the rest has followed as death follows a stab to the heart or water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it <\s>
<s> believe me gentlemen there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what you have done <\s>
<s> once this cheque was altered and presented the work of four minutes four mad minutes the rest has been silence <\s>
<s> but in those four minutes the boy before you has slipped through a door hardly opened into that great cage which never again quite lets a man go the cage of the law <\s>
<s> his further acts his failure to confess the alteration of the counterfoil his preparations for flight are all evidence not of deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from which these subsequent acts arose no they are merely evidence of the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune <\s>

<s> gentlemen men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law for want of that human insight which sees them as they are patients and not criminals <\s>
<s> if the prisoner be found guilty and treated as though he were a criminal type he will as all experience shows in all probability become one <\s>
<s> i beg you not to return a verdict that may thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever <\s>
<s> gentlemen justice is a machine that when some one has once given it the starting push rolls on of itself <\s>

<s> i urge you gentlemen do not ruin this young man <\s>
<s> no sir only that i ran <\s>
<s> not even adding the ty and the nought <\s>
<s> frome sits down and cleaver rises <\s>
<s> but you remember running do you <\s>
<s> i was all out of breath when i got to the bank <\s>
<s> and you don't remember altering the cheque <\s>
<s> divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting over the case is this anything but an ordinary forgery <\s>
<s> i was half frantic all that morning sir <\s>
<s> you don't deny that the ty and the nought were so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier <\s>
<s> it was an accident <\s>
<s> cheerfully queer sort of accident wasn't it <\s>
<s> on which day did you alter the counterfoil <\s>
<s> hanging his head on the wednesday morning <\s>
<s> was that an accident too <\s>
<s> to do that you had to watch your opportunity i suppose <\s>
<s> you don't suggest that you were suffering under great excitement when you did that <\s>
<s> with the fear of being found out <\s>
<s> didn't it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to your employers and restore the money <\s>
<s> there is silence cleaver <\s>
<s> you desired too no doubt to complete your design of taking this woman away <\s>
<s> when i found i'd done a thing like that to do it for nothing seemed so dreadful <\s>
<s> i might just as well have chucked myself into the river <\s>
<s> you knew that the clerk davis was about to leave england didn't it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on him <\s>
<s> it was all done in a moment <\s>
<s> i thought of it afterwards <\s>
<s> and that didn't lead you to avow what you'd done <\s>
<s> sullenly i meant to write when i got out there i would have repaid the money <\s>
<s> but in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been prosecuted <\s>
<s> i knew he was a long way off your lordship <\s>
<s> i thought there'd be time <\s>
<s> i didn't think they'd find it out so soon <\s>
<s> i might remind your lordship that as mr <\s>
<s> walter how had the cheque book in his pocket till after davis had sailed if the discovery had been made only one day later falder himself would have left and suspicion would have attached to him and not to davis from the beginning <\s>
<s> the question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would light on himself and not on davis <\s>
<s> to falder sharply did you know that mr <\s>
<s> walter how had the cheque book till after davis had sailed <\s>
<s> now speak the truth yes or no <\s>
<s> very low no my lord <\s>
