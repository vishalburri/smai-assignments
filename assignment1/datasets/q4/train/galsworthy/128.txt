<s> turning her blue grey eyes on him i expect you are not the last at that <\s>
<s> you see in them what you haf in yourself i think <\s>
<s> oh not a bit you're quite out <\s>
<s> i assure you when we made the attack where i got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who wasn't an absolute hero <\s>
<s> the way they went in never thinking of themselves it was simply ripping <\s>
<s> in a queer voice it is the same too perhaps with the enemy <\s>
<s> you are not a mean man <\s>
<s> how i hate mean men <\s>
<s> they're not mean really they simply don't understand <\s>
<s> you are a babee a good babee aren't you <\s>
<s> the young officer doesn't like this and frowns <\s>
<s> the girl looks a little scared girl <\s>
<s> clingingly but i li ke you for it <\s>
<s> it is so good to find a ni ice man <\s>
<s> abruptly about being lonely <\s>
<s> haven't you any russian friends <\s>
<s> quickly the town is so beeg <\s>

<s> it is no good asking yours <\s>
<s> with a laugh you're a distrustful little soul aren't you <\s>
<s> i haf reason to be don't you think <\s>
<s> i suppose you're bound to think us all brutes <\s>
<s> sitting on a chair close to the window where the moonlight falls on one powdered cheek well i haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time <\s>
<s> i am dreadfully nervous now i am not trusding anybody <\s>
<s> i suppose you haf been killing lots of germans <\s>
<s> we never know unless it happens to be hand to hand i haven't come in for that yet <\s>
<s> but you would be very glad if you had killed some <\s>
<s> i don't think so <\s>
<s> we're all in the same boat so far as that's concerned <\s>
<s> we're not glad to kill each other not most of us <\s>

<s> her breast heaves young off <\s>
<s> leaning forward and patting her knee sorry sorry <\s>
<s> in a smothered voice you are the first who has been kind to me for so long <\s>
<s> i will tell you the truth i am not rooshian at all i am german <\s>
<s> staring my dear girl who cares <\s>
<s> we aren't fighting against women <\s>
