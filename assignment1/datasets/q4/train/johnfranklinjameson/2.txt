<s> 325-326 piracy being from its very nature a less formal proceeding than privateering there are fewer formal documents to present as essential to its history <\s>
<s> in the seventeenth century there are instances of trials for piracy by various courts _e g the court of assistants in massachusetts in 1675 doc <\s>
<s> 41 note 1 and the massachusetts superior court in 1694 doc <\s>
<s> but the regular method which came to prevail was trial by special commissions appointed for the purpose similar to those which were appointed for the trial of pirates in england by virtue of the statute 28 henry viii <\s>
<s> we have such a colonial commission appointed by the governor in doc <\s>

<s> but if american colonial piracy presents a smaller array of legal documents than american colonial privateering it makes up for it by its rich abundance of picturesque narrative and detail <\s>
<s> the pieces here brought together show us piracy off lisbon and in the east indies and at madagascar at portobello and panama and in the south sea in the west indies and all along the atlantic coast from newfoundland to the coast of guiana <\s>
<s> they exhibit to us every relation from that of the most innocent victim to that of the most hardened pirate chief <\s>
<s> they make it clear how narrow was sometimes the line that divided piracy and privateering and how difficult it must have been to learn the truth from witnesses so conflicting and of such dubious characters testifying concerning actions of lawless men in remote seas or on lonely shores <\s>
<s> most of the pirates famed in story who had anything to do with colonial america appear in one way or another in these papers <\s>
<s> on the history of henry every for instance and even on the oft-told tale of william kidd not a little new light is cast <\s>
<s> kidd's letters from prison the letter and petitions of his wife the depositions of companions the additional letters of bellomont make the story live again even though no new evidence appears that is perfectly conclusive as to the still-debated question of his degree of guilt <\s>
<s> the wonderful buccaneering adventures of bartholomew sharp and his companions 1680-1682 at the isthmus of panama and all along the west coast of south america are newly illustrated by long anonymous narratives artless but effective <\s>
<s> and indeed to speak more generally it is hoped that there are few aspects of the pirate's trade that are not somehow represented in these pages <\s>
<s> at least it will not be denied that the documents whether for piracy or for privateering show a considerable variety of origins <\s>
<s> their authors range from a signer of the declaration of independence to an irishwoman keeping a boarding-house in havana from a minister of louis xiv <\s>
<s> or a judge of the high court of admiralty to the most illiterate sailor from governor john endicott most rigid of puritans to the keeper of a rendezvous for pirates and receiver of their ill-gotten goods <\s>
<s> witnesses or writers of many nationalities appear american englishmen scots irishmen frenchmen dutchmen spaniards a portuguese a dane or sleswicker a bohemian a greek a jew <\s>
<s> the languages of the documents are english french dutch spanish portuguese and latin <\s>
<s> though none of them are in german or by germans not the least interesting pieces in the volume are those docs <\s>
<s> 49 which show a curious connection of american colonial history with the very first and characteristically illegal and unscrupulous exploits of the brandenburg-prussian navy <\s>
<s> the range of repositories from which the documents have been procured is also considerable <\s>
<s> many were found in the state archives of massachusetts many in the files of the supreme judicial court for suffolk county many in the collections of the massachusetts historical society others in the archives of rhode island and new york in the office of the surrogate of new york city and in the new york public library <\s>
<s> a very important source of material indispensable indeed for certain classes of document was the records and papers of the vice-admiralty courts of the colonial period <\s>
<s> extensive portions still remain in the case of four of these courts at boston new york philadelphia and charleston see the first foot-notes to docs <\s>
<s> a large number of the documents larger indeed than from any other repository but one were drawn from the inexhaustible stores of the public record office in london namely from the admiralty and colonial office papers <\s>
<s> others came from the privy council office a few but among them two of the longest and most interesting from among the sloane and harleian manuscripts in the british museum one whole group from the rawlinson manuscripts in the bodleian library at oxford <\s>
<s> three of the kidd documents were obtained from among the manuscripts of the duke of portland at welbeck abbey <\s>
<s> several of the pieces and a number of lesser extracts used in annotations were taken from colonial newspapers and two from printed books not often seen <\s>
