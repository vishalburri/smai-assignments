<s> upon notice of this i gave order to the master of the inn that if any body came to look after the mare he should be sure to seize and secure him but no body came for her <\s>
<s> the next morning which was sunday i summoned a council and we published a proclamation wherein i promised a reward of 200 l for the seizing and securing gillam whereupon there was the strictest search all that day and the next that was ever made in this part of the world but we had missed him if i had not been informed of one captain knot as an old pyrate and therefore likely to k now where gillam was concealed 7 i sent for knot and examined him promising h im if h e would make an ingenious confession i would not molest or prosecute him he seemed mu ch disturbed but would not confesse anything to purpose <\s>

<s> the aforesaid will kidd with his freight-ship under the english flag came to anchor off this harbor out of range of the king's fortress and then sent his shallop to land with a letter to me in which he asked me for protection further declaring that he was innocent as to robbing the subjects of the mogul in the east indies <\s>

<s> this i declined to give whereupon he understanding that i had forbidden all inhabitants to sell him any provisions set sail again 3 since that time i have heard that he lay at anchor near the island of mona and that one bolton of antigua had been with him to transact business <\s>

<s> pedro van bellen general director for the electoral brandenburg privileged company and which are also stored in the brandenburg warehouse 5 i have not been able to get at the aforesaid goods because the said brandenburg patentees have here their own law and privileges but i have caused the said will burcke to be arrested and on his giving bail have let him return with the brigantine yet on condition that he should discharge his responsibility to barbadoes he being a subject of his majesty of england and resident there <\s>
<s> since that time he has come here again from barbados bringing with him a recommendation from governor grey 6 to me and is living here still at the brandenburg lodge but all the aforesaid goods have it is said been transported to other places <\s>

<s> i have been so lucky as to take james gillam and he is now in irons in the goal of this town and at the same time with him was sie ze d one francis dole 5 in whose house he was harboured who proves to be one of hore's crew h ore one of colonel fletcher's pyrates commissioned by him from new york dole is also committed to goal <\s>
<s> my taking of gillam was so very accidentall that i cannot forbear giving your lordships a narrative of it and one would believe there was a strange fatality in that m an's starrs <\s>
<s> on saturday the 11th instant late in the evening i had a letter from colonel sanford 6 judge of the admiralty court in rhode-island giving me an account that gillam had been there but was come towards boston a fortnight before in order to ship himselfe for some of the islands jamaica or barbados that he was troubled he knew it not sooner and was affraid his intelligence would come too late to me that the messenger he sent knew the mare gillam rode on to this town <\s>
<s> i was in despair of finding the man because colonel sanford writ to me that he was g one to this town so long a time as a fortnight before that however i sent for an honest constable i had made use of in the apprehending of kidd and his men and sent him with colonel sanford's messenger to examine and search all the inns in town for the mare and at the first inn they went to they found her tied up in the yard the people of the inn reported that the man that brought her thither had lighted off her about a quarter of an hour before had there tied her but went away without saying anything to anybody <\s>
<s> upon notice of this i gave order to the master of the inn that if any body came to look after the mare he should be sure to seize and secure him but no body came for her <\s>
<s> the next morning which was sunday i summoned a council and we published a proclamation wherein i promised a reward of 200 l for the seizing and securing gillam whereupon there was the strictest search all that day and the next that was ever made in this part of the world but we had missed him if i had not been informed of one captain knot as an old pyrate and therefore likely to k now where gillam was concealed 7 i sent for knot and examined him promising h im if h e would make an ingenious confession i would not molest or prosecute him he seemed mu ch disturbed but would not confesse anything to purpose <\s>
<s> i then sent for his wife and examined her on oath apart from her husband and she confessed that one who went by the name of james kelly had lodged severall nights in her house but for some nights past lo dged as she believed in charlestown crosse the river <\s>

<s> upon notice of this i gave order to the master of the inn that if any body came to look after the mare he should be sure to seize and secure him but no body came for her <\s>
<s> the next morning which was sunday i summoned a council and we published a proclamation wherein i promised a reward of 200 l for the seizing and securing gillam whereupon there was the strictest search all that day and the next that was ever made in this part of the world but we had missed him if i had not been informed of one captain knot as an old pyrate and therefore likely to k now where gillam was concealed 7 i sent for knot and examined him promising h im if h e would make an ingenious confession i would not molest or prosecute him he seemed mu ch disturbed but would not confesse anything to purpose <\s>

<s> the aforesaid will kidd with his freight-ship under the english flag came to anchor off this harbor out of range of the king's fortress and then sent his shallop to land with a letter to me in which he asked me for protection further declaring that he was innocent as to robbing the subjects of the mogul in the east indies <\s>

<s> this i declined to give whereupon he understanding that i had forbidden all inhabitants to sell him any provisions set sail again 3 since that time i have heard that he lay at anchor near the island of mona and that one bolton of antigua had been with him to transact business <\s>

<s> pedro van bellen general director for the electoral brandenburg privileged company and which are also stored in the brandenburg warehouse 5 i have not been able to get at the aforesaid goods because the said brandenburg patentees have here their own law and privileges but i have caused the said will burcke to be arrested and on his giving bail have let him return with the brigantine yet on condition that he should discharge his responsibility to barbadoes he being a subject of his majesty of england and resident there <\s>
