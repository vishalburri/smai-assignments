<s> the court being opened and the libell read i beg'd leave of his honour to be heard which being granted i spoke as follows <\s>
<s> may it please your honr <\s>
<s> as there is no advocate appointed by this hon'ble court too appear in behalf of the captures 60 of a sloop that was taken by don pedro estrado july the 5th belonging to some of his majestys subjects of great britain or ireland and retaken by capt <\s>
<s> benj'n norton and comp'y in a private sloop of war called the _revenge_ july the 28th and brought into this court for condemnation as capt <\s>
<s> i appear in behalf of the owners capt <\s>
<s> and comp'y to prove that the said sloop and cargo togather with the three mollattos and one negro all slaves belonging to some of the vessells or subjects of the king of spain ought to be condemned for the benefit and use of the captures as aforesd <\s>
<s> footnote 60 captors i'm certain i'm undertaking a taske no ways qualifyed for it but as i have leave to speak in a court instituted by the laws of england and before a judge whom im certain is endued with the strictest honour and justice i dont doubt that if through ignorance i shoud omit any proof that woud be of advantage to us your honour will be so good as to aid and assist me in it <\s>
<s> it will be needless i believe s'r to bring any further proof than what has been already bro't and sworn too in court to prove the right and power we had in seizing this sloop and cargo on the high seas and bringing of her here for condemnation <\s>
<s> there is a late act of parliament made in the 12 y'r of his present majestys reign 61 wherein it says that all vessells belonging to his majestys subjects of great britain or irel'd that shall be taken by the ennemy and have been in their possession the space of 96 hours if retaken by any private man of war the captures shall be intituled to the one half for salvage free from all charges <\s>
<s> as this h as been fully proved in court that the time the ennemy h as had her in possession is above 96 hours i dont doubt but the one half free of all charges will be allotted us for salvage <\s>
<s> footnote 61 not 12 but 13 geo <\s>
<s> the recaptors were entitled to one-eighth for salvage if the vessel had been in enemy possession 24 hours a fifth if 24-48 hours a third if 48-96 a half if 96 the thing in dispute is the three mollatos and one negro all slaves taken on board the prize said to belong to some of vassalls or subjects of the king of spain and is by this court put to us too prove they are so which hope to do by some circumstances and the insufficiency of the evidence in their favour which amounts to nothing more than hearsay <\s>
<s> the first evidence in their favour is that of john evergin a native of no carolina 62 who professes himself to be a child of the spirit who for the value of a share in april last having been taken prisoner by the said don pedro estrado and brought to st <\s>
<s> augustine did consent to pillott them in the bowells of his native country and betrayed them to that cruel and barbarous nation <\s>
<s> can your honour confide in a man who has betrayed his countrymen robbed them of their lives and also what are dearer to them their liberty one who has exposed his bretheren to eminent dangers and reduced them and their familys to extream wants by fire and sword <\s>
<s> can the evidence i say of so vile a wretch who has forfeited his leige to his king by entring in the ennemys service and unnaturally sold his countrymen be of any weight in a court of justice <\s>
<s> no im certain and i hope it will meet with none to prove that these slaves are freemen for all that he as has said as he owns was only but hearsay <\s>
<s> the other evidence is of a villain of another stamp a french runnagado juan baptist domas <\s>
<s> his evidence is so contrary to the questions askt francisco and aug'ne that i hope it will meet with the same fate as the first deserves not to be regarded <\s>
<s> i'll own he has sworn to it but how <\s>
<s> on a peice of a stick made in the shape of a thing they name a cross said to be blest and sanctyfyed by the poluted words and hands of a wretched priest a spawn of the whore of babylon who is a monster of nature and a servant to the devill who for a riall will pretend to absolve them from perjury incest and parricide and cannonize them for cruelties committed to we herreticks as they stile us and even rank them in the number of those cursed saints who by their barbarity have rendered their names immortall and odious to all true beleivers <\s>
<s> tis by such devills they swear and to them they pray <\s>
<s> can then your hon'r give credit to such evidence who no doubt they had agreed between them that he should swear they were free which he might easily do for no question but they told him so and to swear it was but a trifle when absolution can be gott so cheap <\s>
<s> it does not stand to reason that slaves who are in hopes of getting their freedom wou'd own they are so <\s>
<s> does not their complextion and features tell all the world that they are of the blood of negroes and have suckt slavery and cruelty from their infancy <\s>
<s> can any one think when we call to mind that barbarous action committed to his majestys brave subjects att the retaken of the fort att st <\s>
<s> augustine occasioned by the treachery of their vile gen'l who sacrificed them to that barbarous colour that it was done by any that had the least drop of blood either of liberty or christianity in them <\s>
<s> no im confident your hon'r cant think so no not even of their gov'r under whose vile commission this was suffered to be done and went unpunisht headed by this francisco that cursed seed of cain curst from the foundation of the world who has the impudence to come into court and plead that he is free <\s>
<s> slavery is too good for such a savage nay all the cruelty invented by man will never make amends for so vile a proceeding and if i may be allowed to speak freely with submission the torments of the world to come will not suffice <\s>
<s> god forgive me if i judge unjustly <\s>
<s> what a miserable state must a man be in who is under the jurisdiction of that vile and cruel colour <\s>
<s> i pity my poor fellow creatures whom many have been made prisoners this war and some lately that have been sent to the avanah and all by the treachery of that vile fellow john evergin who says he's posse'd with the spirit of the inward man but was possessed with the spirit of belzebub when he pillotted the cursed spaniards over the barr of obricock as it has been proved in court <\s>
<s> footnote 62 john everigin is recorded as a quaker in the roll of capt <\s>
<s> benjamin palmer's company of the militia regiment of pasquotank county north carolina in 1755 <\s>
<s> 350 i dont doubt but this tragical act acted att st <\s>
<s> augustine has reacht home before now <\s>
<s> this case may perhaps travell as farr <\s>
<s> when they'l remember the sufferings of their countrymen under the command of this francisco whom we have gott in possession with some of his comp'y who were concern'd with him and under his command in that inhuman fact they will agree no doubt as i hope your honour will that they must be slaves and no others concern'd in it so hope that by the contradictions which has been shewn in court concerning this juan baptista domas who affirms he never saw them till on board the privateer and francisco and aug'ne both woud prove that they knew him some months before and converst with him is proof enough they are slaves and hope that by the old law of nations where it says that all prisoners of war nay even their posterity are slaves that by that law pedro sancho and and'w estavie will be decreed as such for the use of the captures <\s>
<s> so shall rest it with your hon'r <\s>
<s> then the judge gave his decree that the sloop and cargo shoud be sold att vandue and the one half thereof shoud be p'd the captures for salvage free from all charges that juan baptisto domas pedro sanche and and'w estavie according to the laws of england shoud remain as prisoners of war till ransomed and that augustine and francisco according to the laws of the plantations shoud be slaves and for the use of the captures <\s>
<s> so the court broke up <\s>
<s> _thursday 20th opened a bb <\s>
<s> this day the vandue begun <\s>
<s> of pork 29 bb <\s>
<s> of beef and 110 bus <\s>
<s> of corn then adjourn'd it till the next day att 8 of the clock <\s>
<s> _friday 21 this day made an end of selling the cargo of the prize <\s>
<s> of corn 41 bbs <\s>
<s> of pork 6 bb <\s>
<s> of beef 13 bbs <\s>
