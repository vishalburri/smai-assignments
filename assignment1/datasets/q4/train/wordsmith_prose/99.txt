<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>

<s> james and i said he are in a puzzle here <\s>
<s> the grass here has spots which offend the eye and i told him we must cover them with soap lees <\s>

<s> then i said we must cover the whole <\s>
<s> he objected that will not do with reference to the little lawn to which you pass from this <\s>
<s> cover that i said <\s>
<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> i remember well that after speaking with love and delight of a very popular volume of poetry he yet found great fault with the want of correctness and finish <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>
<s> wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hill side a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel <\s>

<s> my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do <\s>
<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object <\s>
<s> if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded ;[ 238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems <\s>
<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>
<s> he attributed in part his writing so little to the extreme care and labour which he applied in elaborating his metres <\s>
<s> he said that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre the time and labour he bestowed were inconceivable that he was quite an epicure in sound <\s>
<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>
<s> not that he doubted my uncle's sincerity in his subsequent assertions to the contrary because he said schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos <\s>
<s> i omitted to ask him what seems obvious enough now whether in conversing about it he had never asked my uncle how it would end <\s>
<s> the answer would have settled the question <\s>
<s> he regretted that the story had not been made to end the same night in which it begun <\s>
<s> there was difficulty and danger in bringing such a personage as the witch to the daylight and the breakfast table and unless the poem was to have been long enough to give time for creating a second interest there was a great probability of the conclusion being flat after such a commencement <\s>
<s> 238 you could not walk with him a mile without seeing what a loving interest he took in the play and working of simple natures <\s>
<s> as you ascend kirkstone from paterdale you have a bright stream leaping down from rock to rock on your right with here and there silent pools <\s>

<s> we took bowness and storrs in our way from appleby to lancaster and i visited wordsworth and my dear friend arnold from storrs <\s>
<s> it was my fortune to have to try the great hornby castle cause as it was called this i did at the end of the circuit returning from liverpool to lancaster for the purpose <\s>
<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>
<s> in examining the parts of a landscape he would be minute and he dealt with shrubs flower beds and lawns with the readiness of a practiced landscape gardener <\s>
<s> his own little grounds afforded a beautiful specimen of his skill in this latter respect and it was curious to see how he had imparted the same faculty in some measure to his gardener james dixon i think was his name <\s>
<s> i found them together one morning in the little lawn by the mount <\s>
<s> james and i said he are in a puzzle here <\s>
<s> the grass here has spots which offend the eye and i told him we must cover them with soap lees <\s>

<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> he thought this due to the gift of poetry and the character of the poet <\s>
<s> carelessness in the finish of composition he seemed to look on almost as an offence <\s>
<s> i remember well that after speaking with love and delight of a very popular volume of poetry he yet found great fault with the want of correctness and finish <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>

<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>

<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>

<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> it was my fortune to have to try the great hornby castle cause as it was called this i did at the end of the circuit returning from liverpool to lancaster for the purpose <\s>
<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>

<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>
<s> wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hill side a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel <\s>

<s> my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do <\s>
<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object <\s>
<s> if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded ;[ 238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems <\s>
<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> then i said we must cover the whole <\s>
<s> he objected that will not do with reference to the little lawn to which you pass from this <\s>
<s> cover that i said <\s>
<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>

<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>

<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>
<s> wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hill side a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel <\s>

<s> my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do <\s>
<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object <\s>
<s> if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded ;[ 238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems <\s>
<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> he said that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre the time and labour he bestowed were inconceivable that he was quite an epicure in sound <\s>
<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>
<s> not that he doubted my uncle's sincerity in his subsequent assertions to the contrary because he said schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos <\s>
<s> i omitted to ask him what seems obvious enough now whether in conversing about it he had never asked my uncle how it would end <\s>

<s> he regretted that the story had not been made to end the same night in which it begun <\s>
<s> there was difficulty and danger in bringing such a personage as the witch to the daylight and the breakfast table and unless the poem was to have been long enough to give time for creating a second interest there was a great probability of the conclusion being flat after such a commencement <\s>
<s> 238 you could not walk with him a mile without seeing what a loving interest he took in the play and working of simple natures <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>

<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>

<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>

<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>

<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>

<s> james and i said he are in a puzzle here <\s>
<s> the grass here has spots which offend the eye and i told him we must cover them with soap lees <\s>

<s> then i said we must cover the whole <\s>
<s> he objected that will not do with reference to the little lawn to which you pass from this <\s>
<s> cover that i said <\s>
<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> i remember well that after speaking with love and delight of a very popular volume of poetry he yet found great fault with the want of correctness and finish <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>
<s> wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hill side a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel <\s>

<s> my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do <\s>
<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object <\s>
<s> if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded ;[ 238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems <\s>
<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>
<s> he attributed in part his writing so little to the extreme care and labour which he applied in elaborating his metres <\s>
<s> he said that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre the time and labour he bestowed were inconceivable that he was quite an epicure in sound <\s>
<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>
<s> not that he doubted my uncle's sincerity in his subsequent assertions to the contrary because he said schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos <\s>
<s> i omitted to ask him what seems obvious enough now whether in conversing about it he had never asked my uncle how it would end <\s>
<s> the answer would have settled the question <\s>
<s> he regretted that the story had not been made to end the same night in which it begun <\s>
<s> there was difficulty and danger in bringing such a personage as the witch to the daylight and the breakfast table and unless the poem was to have been long enough to give time for creating a second interest there was a great probability of the conclusion being flat after such a commencement <\s>
<s> 238 you could not walk with him a mile without seeing what a loving interest he took in the play and working of simple natures <\s>
<s> as you ascend kirkstone from paterdale you have a bright stream leaping down from rock to rock on your right with here and there silent pools <\s>

<s> we took bowness and storrs in our way from appleby to lancaster and i visited wordsworth and my dear friend arnold from storrs <\s>
<s> it was my fortune to have to try the great hornby castle cause as it was called this i did at the end of the circuit returning from liverpool to lancaster for the purpose <\s>
<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>
<s> in examining the parts of a landscape he would be minute and he dealt with shrubs flower beds and lawns with the readiness of a practiced landscape gardener <\s>
<s> his own little grounds afforded a beautiful specimen of his skill in this latter respect and it was curious to see how he had imparted the same faculty in some measure to his gardener james dixon i think was his name <\s>
<s> i found them together one morning in the little lawn by the mount <\s>
<s> james and i said he are in a puzzle here <\s>
<s> the grass here has spots which offend the eye and i told him we must cover them with soap lees <\s>

<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> he thought this due to the gift of poetry and the character of the poet <\s>
<s> carelessness in the finish of composition he seemed to look on almost as an offence <\s>
<s> i remember well that after speaking with love and delight of a very popular volume of poetry he yet found great fault with the want of correctness and finish <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>

<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>

<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>

<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> it was my fortune to have to try the great hornby castle cause as it was called this i did at the end of the circuit returning from liverpool to lancaster for the purpose <\s>
<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>
<s> he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them <\s>

<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>
<s> wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hill side a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel <\s>

<s> my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do <\s>
<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object <\s>
<s> if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded ;[ 238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems <\s>
<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>

<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks <\s>
<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> then i said we must cover the whole <\s>
<s> he objected that will not do with reference to the little lawn to which you pass from this <\s>
<s> cover that i said <\s>
<s> to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them some tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend <\s>
<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>
<s> we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk <\s>
<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>

<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>

<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>

<s> during that time mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were <\s>
<s> he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us <\s>
<s> he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems <\s>
<s> the london post i think went out at 2 p m and then he would say he was at our service <\s>
<s> a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm <\s>

<s> these he brought out in a striking way <\s>
<s> apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship <\s>
<s> he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness <\s>

<s> wednesday 21 wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks 236 and calling at hallsteads <\s>

<s> 236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasure grounds here <\s>
<s> he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose <\s>
<s> at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for <\s>
<s> but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before <\s>
<s> he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty <\s>
<s> after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater <\s>
<s> it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste <\s>
<s> on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping <\s>
<s> wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle 237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john <\s>
<s> wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hill side a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel <\s>

<s> my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do <\s>
<s> i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works <\s>
<s> he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the school's foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school <\s>
<s> the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carter's poem on spring a poem in the six line stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth <\s>
<s> he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulph's tower being a sleep walker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name <\s>
<s> michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway <\s>

<s> wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object <\s>
<s> if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded ;[ 238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems <\s>
<s> i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings <\s>
<s> she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve <\s>
<s> he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression <\s>

<s> he said that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre the time and labour he bestowed were inconceivable that he was quite an epicure in sound <\s>
<s> latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers <\s>
<s> he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it <\s>
<s> not that he doubted my uncle's sincerity in his subsequent assertions to the contrary because he said schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos <\s>
<s> i omitted to ask him what seems obvious enough now whether in conversing about it he had never asked my uncle how it would end <\s>

<s> he regretted that the story had not been made to end the same night in which it begun <\s>
<s> there was difficulty and danger in bringing such a personage as the witch to the daylight and the breakfast table and unless the poem was to have been long enough to give time for creating a second interest there was a great probability of the conclusion being flat after such a commencement <\s>
<s> 238 you could not walk with him a mile without seeing what a loving interest he took in the play and working of simple natures <\s>
