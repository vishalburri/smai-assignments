<s> november 1843 wordsworth holds the critical power very low infinitely lower than the inventive and he said to day that if the quantity of time considered in writing critiques on the works of others were given to original composition of whatever kind it might be it would be much better employed it would make a man find out sooner his own level and it would do infinitely less mischief <\s>

<s> at the head of the first class i would place homer and shakspeare whose universal minds are able to reach every variety of thought and feeling without bringing their own individuality before the reader <\s>
<s> they infuse they breathe life into every object they approach but you never find themselves <\s>
<s> at the head of the second class those whom you can trace individually in all they write i would place spenser and milton <\s>
<s> in all that spenser writes you can trace the gentle affectionate spirit of the man in all that milton writes you find the exalted sustained being that he was <\s>
<s> now in what goethe writes who aims to be of the first class the universal you find the man himself the artificial man where he should not be found so consider him a very artificial writer aiming to be universal and yet constantly exposing his individuality which his character was not of a kind to dignify <\s>
<s> he had not sufficiently clear moral perceptions to make him anything but an artificial writer <\s>
<s> tuesday the 2d of may wordsworth and miss f <\s>
<s> came early to walk about and dine <\s>
<s> he was in a very happy kindly mood <\s>
<s> we took a walk on the terrace and he went as usual to his favourite points <\s>
<s> on our return he was struck with the berries on the holly tree and said why should not you and i go and pull some berries from the other side of the tree which is not seen from the window <\s>
<s> and then we can go and plant them in the rocky ground behind the house <\s>
<s> we pulled the berries and set forth with our tool <\s>
<s> i made the holes and the poet put in the berries <\s>
<s> he was as earnest and eager about it as if it had been a matter of importance and as he put the seeds in he every now and then muttered in his low solemn tone that beautiful verse from burns's vision and wear thou this she solemn said and bound the holly round my head <\s>
<s> the polished leaves and berries red did rustling play and like a passing thought she fled in light away <\s>
<s> he clambered to the highest rocks in the tom intake and put in the berries in such situations as nature sometimes does with such true and beautiful effect <\s>
<s> he said i like to do this for posterity <\s>
<s> some people are selfish enough to say what has posterity done for me <\s>
<s> but the past does much for us <\s>
<s> ii additional sent to the present editor by lady richardson <\s>
<s> august 28th 1841 mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth miss fenwick and mrs <\s>
<s> hill came to dine and it rained on the whole day but happily the poet talked on from two to eight without being weary as we certainly were not <\s>
<s> after dinner when we came to the drawing room the conversation turned on the treatment of wordsworth by the reviews of the day <\s>
<s> i had never heard him open out on it before and was much struck with the manner in which he did it from his present elevation looking calmly back on the past and at the same time feeling that an irreparable injury had been done to him at the time when life and hope were young <\s>
<s> as nearly as i can i shall record his words as they were spoken <\s>
<s> he said at the time i resolved to dedicate myself to poetry and separate myself from the ordinary lucrative professions it would certainly have been a great object to me to have reaped the profits i should have done from my writings but for the stupidity of mr <\s>
<s> gifford and the impertinence of mr <\s>
<s> it would have enabled me to purchase many books which i could not obtain and i should have gone to italy earlier which i never could afford to do until i was sixty five when moxon gave me a thousand pounds for my writings <\s>
<s> this was the only kind of injury mr <\s>
<s> jeffrey did me for i immediately perceived that his mind was of that kind that his individual opinion on poetry was of no consequence to me whatever that it was only by the influence his periodical exercised at the time in preventing my poems being read and sold that he could injure me for feeling that my writings were founded on what was true and spiritual in human nature i knew the time would come when they must be known and i never therefore felt his opinion of the slightest value except in preventing the young of that generation from receiving impressions which might have been of use to them through life <\s>
<s> i say this i hope not in a boasting spirit but i am now daily surprised by receiving letters from various places at home and abroad expressive of gratitude to me from persons i never saw or heard of <\s>
<s> as this occurs now i may fairly conclude that it might have been so when the poems appeared but for the tyranny exercised over public opinion by the edinburgh and quarterly reviews <\s>
<s> december 1841 wordsworth and miss fenwick spent the shortest day of the year with us he brought with him his epitaph on southey and as we sat round the fire after dinner my mother asked him to read it to us which he did in his usual impressive manner <\s>
<s> he asked our impression of it <\s>
<s> my mother ventured to tell him of one word or rather two which she thought might be altered with advantage <\s>
<s> they were these wide was his range but ne'er in human breast did private feeling find a holier nest <\s>
<s> holier nest were the words she objected to as not being a correct union of ideas <\s>
<s> he took the suggestion most kindly and said it had been much discussed in his own mind and in his family circle but that he saw the force of what she said and that he was aware many others would see it also <\s>
<s> he said there was yet time to change it and that he should consult judge coleridge whether the line as he once had it did private feeling meet in holier rest would not be more appropriate to the simplicity of an epitaph where you con every word and where every word is expected to bear an exact meaning <\s>
<s> we all thought this was an improvement <\s>
<s> during tea he talked with great animation of the separation of feeling between the rich and poor in this country the reason of this he thinks is the greater freedom we enjoy that the line of demarcation not being so clearly laid down in this country by the law as in others people fancy they must make it for themselves <\s>
<s> he considers christianity the only cure for this state of things <\s>
<s> he spoke of his own desire to carry out the feeling of brotherhood with regard to servants which he all along endeavoured to do <\s>
<s> he doubted whether he might not have had better servants on a different system but he thought it right to endeavour to inspire your domestics with a feeling of common interest <\s>
<s> my mother said she entirely agreed with him but she had always found it most difficult <\s>
<s> iii lady richardson continued <\s>
<s> november 1843 wordsworth holds the critical power very low infinitely lower than the inventive and he said to day that if the quantity of time considered in writing critiques on the works of others were given to original composition of whatever kind it might be it would be much better employed it would make a man find out sooner his own level and it would do infinitely less mischief <\s>
<s> a false or malicious criticism may do much injury to the minds of others a stupid invention either in prose or verse is quite harmless <\s>
<s> december 22d 1843 the shortest day is past and it was a very pleasant one to us for wordsworth and miss fenwick offered to spend it with us <\s>
<s> they came early and although it was misty and dingy he proposed to walk up easedale <\s>
<s> we went by the terrace and through the little gate on the fell round by brimmer head having diverged a little up from easedale nearly as far as the ruined cottage <\s>
<s> he said when he and his sister wandered there so much that cottage was inhabited by a man of the name of benson a waller its last inhabitant <\s>
<s> he said on the terrace this is a striking anniversary to me for this day forty four years ago my sister and i took up our abode at grasmere and three days after we found out this walk which long remained our favourite haunt <\s>
<s> there is always something very touching in his way of speaking of his sister the tones of his voice become more gentle and solemn and he ceases to have that flow of expression which is so remarkable in him on all other subjects <\s>
<s> it is as if the sadness connected with her present condition was too much for him to dwell upon in connection with the past although habit and the omnipotence of circumstance have made its daily presence less oppressive to his spirits <\s>
<s> he said that his sister spoke constantly of their early days but more of the years they spent together in other parts of england than those at grasmere <\s>
<s> as we proceeded on our walk he happened to speak of the frequent unhappiness of married persons and the low and wretched principles on which the greater number of marriages were formed <\s>
<s> he said that unless there was a strong foundation of love and respect the unavoidable breaks and cataracts of domestic life must soon end in mutual aversion for that married life ought not to be in theory and assuredly it never was in practice a system of mere submission on either side but it should be a system of mutual cooperation for the good of each <\s>
<s> if the wife is always expected to conceal her difference of opinion from her husband she ceases to be an equal and the man loses the advantage which the marriage tie is intended to provide for him in a civilised and christian country <\s>
<s> he then went on to say that although he never saw an amiable single woman without wishing that she were married from his strong feeling of the happiness of a well assorted marriage yet he was far from thinking that marriage always improved people <\s>
<s> it certainly did not unless it was a congenial marriage 247 iv mrs <\s>
