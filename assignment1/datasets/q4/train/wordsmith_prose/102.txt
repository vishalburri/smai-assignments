<s> price sat next to mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth and by design or fortunate accident introduced some remark on the powers and the discourse of coleridge <\s>
<s> wordsworth entered heartily and largely on the subject <\s>
<s> he said that the liveliest and truest image he could give of coleridge's talk was that of a majestic river the sound or sight of whose course you caught at intervals which was sometimes concealed by forests sometimes lost in sand then came flashing out broad and distinct then again took a turn which your eye could not follow yet you knew and felt that it was the same river so he said there was always a train a stream in coleridge's discourse always a connection between its parts in his own mind though one not always perceptible to the minds of others <\s>
<s> wordsworth went on to say that in his opinion coleridge had been spoilt as a poet by going to germany <\s>
<s> the bent of his mind which was at all times very much to metaphysical theology had there been fixed in that direction <\s>
<s> if it had not been so said wordsworth he would have been the greatest the most abiding poet of his age <\s>
<s> his very faults would have made him popular meaning his sententiousness and laboured strain while he had enough of the essentials of a poet to make him deservedly popular in a higher sense <\s>
<s> price soon after mentioned a statement of coleridge's respecting himself recorded in his table talk namely that a visit to the battle field of marathon would raise in him no kindling emotion and asked mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth whether this was true as a token of his mind <\s>
<s> that was a mere bravado for the sake of astonishing his hearers <\s>
<s> but then correcting himself he added and yet it might in some sense be true for coleridge was not under the influence of external objects <\s>
<s> he had extraordinary powers of summoning up an image or series of images in his own mind and he might mean that his idea of marathon was so vivid that no visible observation could make it more so <\s>
<s> a remarkable instance of this added mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth is his poem said to be composed in the vale of chamouni <\s>
<s> now he never was at chamouni or near it in his life <\s>
<s> wordsworth next gave a somewhat humorous account of the rise and progress of the ancient mariner <\s>
<s> it arose he said out of the want of five pounds which coleridge and i needed to make a tour together in devonshire <\s>
<s> we agreed to write jointly a poem the subject of which coleridge took from a dream which a friend of his had once dreamt concerning a person suffering under a dire curse from the commission of some crime <\s>
<s> i said wordsworth supplied the crime the shooting of the albatross from an incident i had met with in one of shelvocke's voyages <\s>
<s> we tried the poem conjointly for a day or two but we pulled different ways and only a few lines of it are mine <\s>
<s> from coleridge the discourse then turned to scotland <\s>
<s> wordsworth in his best manner with earnest thoughts given out in noble diction gave his reasons for thinking that as a poet scott would not live <\s>
<s> i don't like he said to say all this or to take to pieces some of the best reputed passages of scott's verse especially in presence of my wife because she thinks me too fastidious but as a poet scott cannot live for he has never in verse written anything addressed to the immortal part of man <\s>
<s> in making amusing stories in verse he will be superseded by some newer versifier what he writes in the way of natural description is merely rhyming nonsense <\s>
<s> as a prose writer mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth admitted that scott had touched a higher vein because there he had really dealt with feeling and passion <\s>
<s> as historical novels professing to give the manners of a past time he did not attach much value to those works of scott's so called because that he held to be an attempt in which success was impossible <\s>
<s> this led to some remarks on historical writing from which it appeared that mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth has small value for anything but contemporary history <\s>
<s> he laments that dr <\s>
<s> arnold should have spent so much of his time and powers in gathering up and putting into imaginary shape the scattered fragments of the history of rome 248 these scraps of wordsworth's large thoughtful earnest discourse seem very meagre as i note them down and in themselves perhaps hardly worth preserving and yet this is an evening which those who spent it in his company will long remember <\s>
<s> his venerable head his simple natural and graceful attitude in his arm chair his respectful attention to the slightest remarks or suggestions of others in relation to what was spoken of his kindly benevolence of expression as he looked round now and then on the circle in our little parlour all bent to devour up his discourse filled up and enlarged the meaning which i fear is but ill conveyed in the words as they are now set down <\s>

<s> wordsworth entered heartily and largely on the subject <\s>
<s> he said that the liveliest and truest image he could give of coleridge's talk was that of a majestic river the sound or sight of whose course you caught at intervals which was sometimes concealed by forests sometimes lost in sand then came flashing out broad and distinct then again took a turn which your eye could not follow yet you knew and felt that it was the same river so he said there was always a train a stream in coleridge's discourse always a connection between its parts in his own mind though one not always perceptible to the minds of others <\s>
<s> wordsworth went on to say that in his opinion coleridge had been spoilt as a poet by going to germany <\s>
<s> the bent of his mind which was at all times very much to metaphysical theology had there been fixed in that direction <\s>
<s> if it had not been so said wordsworth he would have been the greatest the most abiding poet of his age <\s>

<s> wordsworth whether this was true as a token of his mind <\s>
<s> that was a mere bravado for the sake of astonishing his hearers <\s>
<s> but then correcting himself he added and yet it might in some sense be true for coleridge was not under the influence of external objects <\s>
<s> he had extraordinary powers of summoning up an image or series of images in his own mind and he might mean that his idea of marathon was so vivid that no visible observation could make it more so <\s>
<s> a remarkable instance of this added mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth is his poem said to be composed in the vale of chamouni <\s>
<s> now he never was at chamouni or near it in his life <\s>
<s> wordsworth next gave a somewhat humorous account of the rise and progress of the ancient mariner <\s>
<s> it arose he said out of the want of five pounds which coleridge and i needed to make a tour together in devonshire <\s>
<s> we agreed to write jointly a poem the subject of which coleridge took from a dream which a friend of his had once dreamt concerning a person suffering under a dire curse from the commission of some crime <\s>

<s> i don't like he said to say all this or to take to pieces some of the best reputed passages of scott's verse especially in presence of my wife because she thinks me too fastidious but as a poet scott cannot live for he has never in verse written anything addressed to the immortal part of man <\s>

<s> price sat next to mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth and by design or fortunate accident introduced some remark on the powers and the discourse of coleridge <\s>
<s> wordsworth entered heartily and largely on the subject <\s>
<s> he said that the liveliest and truest image he could give of coleridge's talk was that of a majestic river the sound or sight of whose course you caught at intervals which was sometimes concealed by forests sometimes lost in sand then came flashing out broad and distinct then again took a turn which your eye could not follow yet you knew and felt that it was the same river so he said there was always a train a stream in coleridge's discourse always a connection between its parts in his own mind though one not always perceptible to the minds of others <\s>
<s> wordsworth went on to say that in his opinion coleridge had been spoilt as a poet by going to germany <\s>
<s> the bent of his mind which was at all times very much to metaphysical theology had there been fixed in that direction <\s>
<s> if it had not been so said wordsworth he would have been the greatest the most abiding poet of his age <\s>
<s> his very faults would have made him popular meaning his sententiousness and laboured strain while he had enough of the essentials of a poet to make him deservedly popular in a higher sense <\s>
<s> price soon after mentioned a statement of coleridge's respecting himself recorded in his table talk namely that a visit to the battle field of marathon would raise in him no kindling emotion and asked mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth whether this was true as a token of his mind <\s>
<s> that was a mere bravado for the sake of astonishing his hearers <\s>
<s> but then correcting himself he added and yet it might in some sense be true for coleridge was not under the influence of external objects <\s>
<s> he had extraordinary powers of summoning up an image or series of images in his own mind and he might mean that his idea of marathon was so vivid that no visible observation could make it more so <\s>
<s> a remarkable instance of this added mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth is his poem said to be composed in the vale of chamouni <\s>
<s> now he never was at chamouni or near it in his life <\s>
<s> wordsworth next gave a somewhat humorous account of the rise and progress of the ancient mariner <\s>
<s> it arose he said out of the want of five pounds which coleridge and i needed to make a tour together in devonshire <\s>
<s> we agreed to write jointly a poem the subject of which coleridge took from a dream which a friend of his had once dreamt concerning a person suffering under a dire curse from the commission of some crime <\s>
<s> i said wordsworth supplied the crime the shooting of the albatross from an incident i had met with in one of shelvocke's voyages <\s>
<s> we tried the poem conjointly for a day or two but we pulled different ways and only a few lines of it are mine <\s>
<s> from coleridge the discourse then turned to scotland <\s>
<s> wordsworth in his best manner with earnest thoughts given out in noble diction gave his reasons for thinking that as a poet scott would not live <\s>
<s> i don't like he said to say all this or to take to pieces some of the best reputed passages of scott's verse especially in presence of my wife because she thinks me too fastidious but as a poet scott cannot live for he has never in verse written anything addressed to the immortal part of man <\s>
